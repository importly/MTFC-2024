What is rubella?
Rubella is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by slight fever, mild rash and swollen glands. Although most cases are mild, if rubella is contracted early in pregnancy, it can spread from the mother to her developing baby through the bloodstream and result in birth defects and/or fetal death. As a result of widespread immunization, rubella does not circulate in the United States, but can be contracted through foreign travel.
Who gets rubella?
The number of cases of rubella decreased dramatically in the United States following the introduction of the rubella vaccine in 1969. The decrease was greatest among children. Adults account for an increasing proportion of the few cases that still occur in United States. These are often individuals who remain unvaccinated for religious reasons or are foreign-born immigrants who come from areas where rubella vaccine is not routinely used. Rubella still remains a common disease in many parts of the world and the risk of exposure to rubella outside of the United States is high. Travelers to countries where rubella cases still occur should be immune to rubella.
How is rubella spread?
Rubella is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected individuals. Rubella can also be transmitted by breathing in droplets that are sprayed into the air when an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks.
What are the symptoms of rubella?
Rubella is a mild illness which may present few or no symptoms. Symptoms may include a rash, slight fever, joint aches, headache, discomfort, runny nose, sore throat and reddened eyes. The lymph nodes just behind the ears and at the back of the neck may swell, causing some soreness and/or pain. The rash, which may be itchy, first appears on the face and progresses from head to foot, lasting about three days. As many as half of all rubella cases occur without a rash.
How soon do symptoms appear?
The usual incubation period for rubella is 14 days; with a range of 12 to 23 days.
What are the complications associated with rubella?
Complications occur more frequently in adult women, who may experience arthritis or arthralgia, often affecting the fingers, wrists and knees. These joint symptoms rarely last for more than a month after appearance of the rash.
Up to 85 percent of infants infected with rubella in the first trimester of pregnancy will suffer birth defects and/or neurologic abnormalities (Congenital Rubella Syndrome, CRS).
What is the treatment for rubella?
There is no specific treatment for rubella.
When and for how long is a person able to spread rubella?
Rubella may be transmitted from seven days before to seven days after the rash appears.
Does past infection with rubella make a person immune?
Yes. Immunity acquired after contracting the disease is usually permanent.
What is the vaccine for rubella?
Rubella vaccine is given in combination measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and is recommended for anyone born on or after January 1, 1957 who does not have laboratory evidence of rubella immunity. Birth before 1957 is not acceptable evidence of rubella immunity for women who could become pregnant; women of childbearing age should have their immunity checked and receive rubella vaccine if needed.
Although only one dose of rubella-containing vaccine is required as acceptable evidence of immunity to rubella, children should receive two doses of MMR vaccine. Rubella vaccine is first given on or after a child's first birthday as MMR vaccine. Children usually receive the first dose between 12 and 15 months of age and the second dose prior to school entry at four to six years of age.
In New York State, rubella vaccine is required of all children enrolled in all pre-kindergarten programs and schools. Healthcare personnel and college students are also required to demonstrate immunity against rubella.
What is the danger of not being immunized against rubella?
Rubella infection is dangerous because of its ability to damage an unborn baby. If rubella immunization was discontinued, immunity to rubella would decline and rubella disease would return. The danger would be to pregnant women who, if infected, could pass the disease to their infants (fetuses) causing CRS.
What can be done to prevent the spread of rubella?
Maintaining high levels of rubella immunization in the community is critical to controlling the spread. Control of the spread of rubella is needed primarily to prevent the birth defects caused by CRS. Therefore, women of childbearing age should have their immunity checked and receive rubella vaccine if needed. Infected individuals should be excluded from work or school during their infectious period.
What is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)?
Congenital rubella syndrome occurs among at least 25 percent of infants born to women who had rubella during the first three months of pregnancy. Infection of a pregnant woman can result in a miscarriage, stillbirth or the birth of an infant with abnormalities which may include deafness, blindness, cataracts, heart defects, mental retardation, liver and spleen damage.

Abstract
To examine cultural aspects in social anxiety and social anxiety disorder (SAD), we reviewed the literature on the prevalence rates, expressions, and treatments of social anxiety/SAD as they relate to culture, race, and ethnicity. We further reviewed factors that contribute to the differences in social anxiety/SAD between different cultures, including individualism/collectivism, perception of social norms, self-construal, gender roles, and gender role identification. Our review suggests that the prevalence and expression of social anxiety/SAD depends on the particular culture. Asian cultures typically show the lowest rates, whereas Russian and US samples show the highest rates, of SAD. Taijin kyofusho is discussed as a possible culture-specific expression of social anxiety, although the empirical evidence concerning the validity of this syndrome has been mixed. It is concluded that the individual's social concerns need to be examined in the context of the person's cultural, racial, and ethnic background in order to adequately assess the degree and expression of social anxiety and social anxiety disorder. This has direct relevance for the upcoming DSM-V.
The defining feature of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the fear of negative evaluation by others. Therefore, SAD is directly linked to social standards and role expectations, which are culture dependent. Recognizing the intricate interplay between culture and social anxiety, some research has focused on psychopathologic manifestations of SAD across cultures [1], while in other studies the focus has been on comparing disorder-typical symptoms across cultures [2]. It should be noted that most of the studies on cultural differences in SAD have examined Eastern (especially Japanese, Korean, and Chinese) and Western (US American and European) samples.
The following is a review of the evidence pertaining to the validity of the DSM-IV-TR criteria for social anxiety disorder (SAD) as it relates to culture, race, and ethnicity. We use the term “race” when we refer to broad differentiations based on physiognomy (e.g., White), “ethnicity” when we refer to “common descent” and affiliation with a historically continuous community (e.g., Latino), and “culture” when we refer to social groups with specific or homogenous attributes. We particularly concentrate on culture as a source for the nosological revisions to explore whether certain cognitive/ behavioral elements (e.g., interpretations of illness; patterned reactions to stressors) affect the development or expression of psychiatric syndromes.
The search methods for the current review entailed a thorough computer search using the Pubmed and PsychInfo databases for articles published since the publication of the DSM-IV in 1994. Specifically, key words relevant to SAD (i.e., “social phobia” or “social anxiety disorder”) were combined with the terms “culture”, “ethnic*”, and “race”. This approach yielded 602 articles, which were evaluated for relevance to the present topic. Finally, bibliographies of key articles were inspected, as well as references from 1965–1994 (as appropriate), to augment the final reference list.
In this review, we first discuss cultural differences in rates of SAD, in the form that SAD takes (emphasizing the well-researched case of TKS), and in treatment response. The final section examines key factors that generate SAD and affect its presentation, and discusses how these key mechanism may be influenced by culture. We end with a discussion of the implications of the review.

Cultural Differences in Prevalence Rates
Data from the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) show that the 12-month prevalence rate of SAD among US adults is 7.1–7.9% [3, 4]. Similar rates have been found in other cultural groups: 6.4% in Chile [5] and 9.1% in Brazil [6]. In contrast, the 12-month prevalence rate of SAD from East Asian surveys, although less studied, has been reported to be much lower, in the range of 0.4% in Taiwan [7], 0.2– 0.6% in Korea [8. 9], 0.2% in China [10], and 0.8% in Japan [11]. The prevalence rates in several other populations have been found to be similarly low, such as in epidemiological surveys of Mexico (1.7%; [12]), Nigeria (0.3%; [13]), South Africa (1.9%; [14]) and Europe (0.8%; [15]). In contrast, the 12-month prevalence rate of SAD in the rural population of Udmurtia, a Constituent Republic of the Russian Federation, was estimated to be 44.2% when using ICD-10 criteria and to be 49.4% when using those of the DSM-III-R [16]. In that study, the disorder was more prevalent in women (50.7%) than in men (35.6%), and more prevalent in ethnic Udmurts (50.3%) than in Russians (32.6%). Finally, a study with Omani college students estimated that, depending on the assessment instrument, between 37% and 54% of individuals might meet criteria for SAD [17]. Table 1 provides a summary of the prevalence rates of the DSM-IV diagnosis of SAD across different countries.

The 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 43,093) showed that being Native American, being young, and having low income increased the risk for developing this disorder, whereas being male, being of Asian, Hispanic, or black race/ethnicity, or living in urban or more populated regions reduced this risk [18]. Similarly, a comparison between Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites from the NCS-R showed that both minority groups had lower risk for SAD as well as for depression and generalized anxiety disorder as compared to the non-Hispanic White group [19]. However, the lower rate among minorities was more pronounced at lower levels of education. Furthermore, the lower rate among Hispanics, relative to non-Hispanic Whites, was found only among the younger cohort (age ≤ 43 years). This pattern of race-ethnic differences in rate for psychiatric disorders suggests the presence of protective factors that originate in childhood and have generalized effects on internalizing disorders (i.e., anxiety disorders and depression).
A study that compared 62 adult outpatients with SAD who presented at a university clinic for anxiety and depressive disorders in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with those who reported in clinical samples from North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania (as identified through a systematic review in the published literature), showed that the majority of socio-demographic features and symptoms of this disorder were relatively independent of geographic and cultural differences [20]. Patients with SAD were generally characterized by a high percentage of males in clinical samples, early onset of the disorder, high education levels, and high comorbidity rates.
Our review of the epidemiological literature suggests a wide range of the lifetime prevalence rates of SAD with Asian samples having some of the lowest rates, and Russian samples having some of the highest rates. Similarly, Asian race/ethnicity is associated with some of the lowest prevalence rates among US samples. Being Hispanic or black was also associated with a lower risk for SAD. It remains uncertain to what extent these differences in prevalence rates reflect genuine differences in psychopathology, or whether they are due to insufficient consideration of cultural aspects of the DSM criteria, the assessment instruments, or the influence of features associated with race and culture, such as level of education. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that the diagnostic threshold used by mental health professionals differs across cultures. For example, one study investigated differences in the diagnosis of SAD by 31 Japanese psychiatrists in Tokyo and 22 American psychiatrists in Hawaii [21]. A brief segment of videotaped interviews and written case histories of 4 Japanese patients from Tokyo and 2 Japanese-American patients from Hawaii, who were diagnosed with SAD, were presented to the clinicians for their diagnosis. Japanese clinicians tended to diagnose SAD congruently for the Japanese cases but not for the Japanese-American cases. American clinicians tended to diagnose various categories including generalized anxiety disorders and avoidant personality disorder, in addition to SAD, regardless of the ethnic background of the patients. Thus, the diagnostic pattern for SAD varied considerably between psychiatrists of these two countries, possibly because of the patient's cardinal symptom manifestation, style of problem presentation, the clinician's professional orientation, familiarity with this disorder and the diagnostic system, and, most importantly, the clinician's own cultural beliefs about the meaning of anxiety symptoms.

Cultural Specific Presentations of SAD
Taijin kyofusho (TKS) has frequently been discussed as a culture-specific expression of SAD that is believed to be particularly prevalent in Japanese and Korean cultures. Similar to individuals suffering from SAD, individuals with TKS are concerned about being observed and consequently avoid a variety of social situations. It has been assumed that the major difference from typical SAD in Western cultures is that a person with TKS is concerned about doing something, or presenting an appearance, that will offend or embarrass the other person. In contrast, SAD is defined as the fear of embarrassing oneself. Therefore, investigators have referred to this as the offensive subtype of TKS because it is characterized by two features considered atypical of social anxiety disorder: the belief that one displays physical defects and/or socially inappropriate behaviors and the fear of offending others, termed as an allocentric focus of social fears [22].
Examples of TKS may include individuals who fear that they would offend others by emitting offensive odors, blushing, staring inappropriately, and presenting an improper facial expression or physical deformity [23]. Most patients with TKS only experience a single circumscribed fear, although the specific focus may change over time. More males than females (at the ratio of 3:2) present with this problem [23]. TKS cases seem to vary on a continuum of severity from highly prevalent but transient adolescent social concerns to delusional disorders [24].
In the Japanese diagnostic system, taijin kyofusho is classified into four subtypes, depending on the content of the patient's fear in respect to displeasing or embarrassing others. These subtypes are: sekimen-kyofu (the fear of blushing), shubo-kyofu (the fear of a deformed body), jikoshisen-kyofu (the fear of eye-to-eye contact), and jikoshu-kyofu (the fear of one's own foul body odor). Of these four subtypes, sekimen-kyofu and taijin kyofusho appear to be most closely associated with the current DSM definition of SAD, whereas shubo-kyofu appears to be most closely associated with body dysmorphic disorder.”most closely associated with body dysmorphic disorder [25].
A study by Kleinknecht and colleagues examined differences in SAD (as defined by DSM-IV) and TKS, and their relation to independence and interdependence in 181 U.S. students and 161 students enrolled in Japanese universities [2]. Factor analyses yielded three factors, each corresponding to the respective scales defining TKS and DSM-defined SAD. A case analysis indicated that there was an approximate 50% co-occurrence between high scorers on the TKS and SAD scales. Multiple regression analyses resulted in a different set of predictors of TKS and self-reported social anxiety for the U.S. and Japanese respondents. Stepwise regression analyses were conducted using independent and interdependent self construals, embarrassability, social interaction anxiety, and SAD as predictors for TKS. For the US sample, only SAD and social interaction anxiety predicted TKS, whereas for the Japanese sample, social interaction anxiety, SAD, and independent self-construal contributed positively to the prediction of TKS. Similarly, different variables predicted SAD. For the US sample, TKS, social interaction anxiety, and embarrassability predicted SAD, whereas for the Japanese sample, only TKS and social interaction anxiety were significant predictors for SAD. These results suggest that cultural variables can mediate the expression of social anxiety. However, both forms of social anxiety can be found in each sample.
Sakurai and colleagues examined the symptom structure and clinical subtypes of patients with DSM-IV SAD among the Japanese clinical population [26]. The authors performed confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses of the joint Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and Social Phobia Scale [27] from 149 psychiatric patients diagnosed with SAD. Based on the derived symptom factors, the authors also performed a cluster analysis to identify patient subgroups. The factor analysis revealed three factors which were identified as scrutiny fears, conversation fears, and relationship fears. The first two seemed to be common to Western clinical populations, whereas the third appeared unique to the Japanese. The authors noted that that the relationship fears factor does not seem to measure the construct in a straightforward manner and that some items merged into “interaction anxiety” for the US sample and did not constitute a distinct symptom factor. The authors argued that, therefore, the items defining the relationship fears factor may have a unique meaning for Japanese people, who typically pay close attention to others' thoughts and feelings even without direct interaction in a group-oriented society.
A recent investigation examined the offensive subtype of TKS [22] by assessing the allocentric focus of fear in US (n = 181) and Korean (n = 64) patients with DSM-IV social anxiety disorder, using a TKS Questionnaire. The results showed that 75% of patients with SAD in the US and Korea endorsed at least one of the five offensive TKS symptoms surveyed. In both samples, the severity of features of offensive TKS was significantly associated with severity of social anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and disability. These results showed that features of the offensive subtype of TKS are not uncommon among US patients with SAD, suggesting they may not be as culturally specific as previously believed.
Another recent study examined the cultural specificity of an offensive subtype of TKS as compared to SAD in 94 participants with SAD and 39 normal controls who did not meet criteria for any mental disorder [28]. All participants lived in Australia and were born in Western countries. The results showed that levels of offensive worry were significantly elevated in individuals with SAD, and this decreased after treatment of their SAD. Correlational analyses suggested that TKS and SAD were clearly strongly related. However, diagnostic examination revealed that the prevalence of reported offensive symptoms (8 out of 94; 8.5%) was extremely low among participants with SAD in Australia and none of them met the full criteria for TKS.
A study by Nakamura [29] examined the relationship between TKS and SAD by conducting DSM-III-R structured clinical interviews with 88 outpatients who visited a hospital in Japan, where they were requesting Morita Therapy (a traditional form of Japanese psychotherapy that combines mindfulness mediation practices, physical activity, and acceptance techniques to treat emotional problems). The patients were also independently diagnosed by 3 psychiatrists to confirm the TKS diagnosis. In total, 65.8% of the 38 cases of TKS were given the diagnosis of SAD. In a second study by the same author [29], 20 Japanese individuals with SAD were compared with 21 cases of SAD in Canada whose diagnoses were based on DSM-III-R. The results showed that many symptoms that had been considered as key characteristics of the Japanese TKS, such as the concern that one's own glance may make others uncomfortable, were also observed among the Canadian SAD sample. Furthermore, the symptoms in both groups tended to exacerbate when exposed to a large group of people rather than a small group, people of the opposite sex rather than of the same sex, peers of the same age rather than the senior or the junior, and acquaintances rather than strangers or intimate persons.
One group of researchers investigated 111 Japanese university students who reported feeling tense or nervous in social or interpersonal interactions and analyzed their responses to items on a scale for TKS [30]. Cluster analysis of the factor scores revealed a group (N=25) with symptomatic profiles that fit offensive-type TKS. Despite this group's high TKS scores, their scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale were relatively low. The authors interpreted these results as suggesting that the symptoms of some TKS sufferers do not fall within the SAD spectrum.
Another less studied but possibly culture-specific expression of SAD is aymat zibur. Literally translated, it is the fear of the community, a term used by ultra-orthodox Jews to describe fears of performance, although in its original meaning the term expresses the respect that the leader of prayers is expected to have for his awesome role. Greenberg, Stravynski, and Bilu described 3 cases of SAD in this community [31]. The patients' concerns included performing by either speaking on religious matters publicly, a role associated with status and authority, or leading prayers and ceremonies, a role of sanctity and duty. The authors reported an absence of women sufferers, which may be understood as a consequence of the value placed on modesty in women and there being no expectation of women to participate in study and public prayer. The authors further reported the absence of complaints of interactional SAD, which may be a consequence of the general discouragement of social intercourse not related to religious study. The cases described were motivated by personal shame, similar to SAD of the performance variety found in other cultures, rather than fear and respect [31].
It should be noted that a TKS-like presentation has been found in other cultures. In a case series of 6 patients (aged 16–43 yrs) with the offensive type of TKS [32], the authors compared features of TKS with those of SAD and compared treatment outcomes for 4 patients with TKS treatment experience in Japan and Korea with Western treatments for SAD. The authors reported that the features of the offensive type of TKS showed much overlap with symptoms of SAD.
Based on this review, it appears that culture may influence SAD in very important ways. Though there is evidence to suggest that different expressions of TKS also appear in non-Asian cultures [2], the rate of this disorder, and the meanings of the symptoms in those cultural contexts will greatly differ. It is possible that TKS symptoms are more likely to be expressed by individuals who construe themselves as low on independence but high on interdependence, whereas SAD symptoms are more likely to be expressed by individuals who construe themselves as low on interdependence but high on independence [33]. Clearly cultures will vary along these dimensions (see below for further discussion). In addition, in the Japanese context, given that TKS-like symptoms are a known response to social situations, this will shape the experiencing and reaction to social situations in important ways.

Cross-Cultural Differences in Treatment Response
It has been shown that Black and White children similarly improved from pre- to post-treatment after cognitive behavioral therapy with no significant differences based on race [34]. Similarly, cognitive behavioral therapy that was developed for Western patients was similarly effective for Japanese and Western patients [35] and Hispanic/Latino youths [36]. However, these preliminary studies are based on only small numbers of participants and it is possible that there are cultural differences in treatment seeking behaviors [37,38]. For example, a study by Hsu and Alden [37] examined culture-related influences on willingness to seek treatment for social anxiety in first- and second-generation students of Chinese heritage (Ns=65 and 47, respectively), and their European-heritage counterparts (N=60). Participants completed measures that assessed their willingness to seek treatment for various levels of social anxiety. Results showed that participants were similar on willingness to seek treatment at low- and high-severity levels of social anxiety. However, at moderate levels, first-generation Chinese participants were significantly less willing to seek treatment compared to their European-heritage counterparts. The reluctance of first-generation Chinese participants to seek treatment was associated with greater Chinese-heritage acculturation, and was not related to perceiving symptoms of social anxiety as less impairing. The findings support the general contention that Asians in North America tend to delay treatment for mental health problems [39].
A study by Roy-Byrne [40] examined the effects of paroxetine among ethnic minority patients with mood and anxiety disorders, including major depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The authors pooled data from 14,875 adults who participated in 104 double-blind, placebo-controlled paroxetine clinical trials from March 1984 through March 2002. An intent-to-treat analysis with last observation carried forward used the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale to measure a dichotomous outcome, classified as either response (CGI score of 1 or 2) or more complete response (CGI score of 1) (“full response”). Minority group differences were examined using logistic regression. Furthermore, a survival analysis examined group differences in speed of onset of response. The results showed that Hispanic and Asian subjects had a slightly lower response rate overall, while Asians had the highest rates and Hispanics had the lowest rates of “full response.” The relative consistency in outcome for Hispanics as compared to Asians appeared to be due to a higher placebo response rate in the Hispanic cohort. Speed of response and adverse effects were similar across groups. Finally, TKS appears to respond well to serotonin reuptake inhibitors [41–43; for a review, see 44] and selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors [45]. In general, these data do not provide any convincing evidence that race/ethnicity predicts response or non-response to any psychological or pharmacological treatments.

Cultural Factors that May Influence SAD: Future Research Directions
A key approach to cross-cultural examination of disorders across cultures is an examination of the factors that generate the disorder, and then a consideration of why those mechanisms would be influenced by culture. Researchers have illustrated that certain factors vary by culture and hence lead to a different trajectory of social anxiety disorder: individualism/collectivism, social norms, self-construal, and gender role and gender role identification. This literature will be summarized in the following sections, which also suggest important future research directions.
Individualism and Collectivism
A concept that has been given a considerable degree of attention in cross-cultural research is the notion of individualism/collectivism [46–48]. Collectivism describes the relationship between members of social organizations that emphasize the interdependence of its members. In collectivistic cultures, harmony within the group is the highest priority and individual gain is considered to be less important than improvement of the broader social group. Thus, it is possible that in collectivistic countries more overt social norms exist to maintain social harmony. In contrast, in individualistic societies, individual achievements and success receive the greatest reward and social admiration.
Lucas and colleagues demonstrated that social contacts serve different purposes in individualistic versus collectivistic cultures [47]. In individualistic cultures, individual feelings and thoughts more directly determine behavior. In collectivistic cultures, harmony within the group is the highest priority, and norms and role expectations have a considerable impact on behavior. Thus, in collectivistic cultures more rules and guidelines for social behavior possibly exist that make social slips more obvious than in individualistic cultures.
In Asia, South America, the Pacific Islands, and Southern European countries, strict social rules are supposed to be provided about what behavior is appropriate in certain social situations [e.g., 49–51]. If an individual deviates from these social rules, they are threatened by sanctions, such as exclusion from the group. Therefore, it is important for individuals in such countries that their social behavior is evaluated as appropriate and positive [52]. Further, norms are strong predictors of life satisfaction in collectivistic but not individualistic countries [52]. Thus, it is possible that it is the match between the cultural orientation of a person and the cultural norms that contribute to SAD and other emotional disorders, especially if the person shows extreme collectivist orientation (allocentric) or extreme individualist values (idiocentric). This hypothesis was examined by Caldwell-Harris and Aycicegi [53], who administered individualism-collectivism scenarios and a battery of clinical and personality scales to college students in Boston and Istanbul. For students residing in a highly individualistic society (Boston), collectivism scores were positively correlated with social anxiety, as well as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and dependent personality. Individualism scores were negatively correlated with these same scales. A different pattern was obtained for students residing in a collectivist culture (Istanbul), where individualism was positively correlated with scales for paranoid, schizoid, narcissistic, borderline and antisocial personality disorders. Collectivism was associated with low report of symptoms on these scales. These results suggest that conflicts between personal values and values of society are associated with SAD and other clinical symptoms. This notion is consistent with the results of a study investigating the associations between the frequency of, and motivations for, social withdrawal during adolescence and emotional distress in young adulthood. The findings showed that shy and unsociable individuals in Korea showed better social and emotional adjustment than their counterparts in Australia [28].
A study by Heinrichs and colleagues [54] investigated individuals' personal and perceived cultural norms and their relation to social anxiety and fear of blushing. A total of 909 participants from eight countries completed vignettes describing social situations and evaluated the social acceptability of the behavior of the main actor both from their own personal perspective as well as from a cultural viewpoint. Personal and cultural norms showed somewhat different patterns in comparison between types of countries (individualistic/collectivistic). According to reported cultural norms, collectivistic countries were more accepting toward socially reticent and withdrawn behaviors than was the case in individualistic countries. In contrast, there was no difference between individualistic and collectivistic countries on individuals' personal perspectives regarding socially withdrawn behavior. Collectivistic countries also reported greater levels of social anxiety and more fear of blushing than individualistic countries. Significant positive relations occurred between the extent to which attention-avoiding behaviors are accepted in a culture and the level of social anxiety or fear of blushing symptoms.
In a later study [55], the authors conducted a replication and extension by including Latin American countries in the collectivistic group. The sample included 478 participants from individualistic countries and 388 individuals from collectivistic countries (including East Asian and Latin American). The results from the earlier study by Heinrichs and colleagues were replicated for the individualistic and Asian countries, but not for Latin American countries, which displayed the lowest social anxiety levels.
In sum, although the individualism-collectivism distinction does not fully capture the relevant norms, there is some evidence in the literature to suggest that social anxiety is related to different cultural norms across countries. Specifically, it is possible that the cultural differences in reported levels of social anxiety are related to social norms and standards toward publicly displaying signs for social anxiety. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously because they are entirely based on non-clinical student samples.
Social Norms, Embarrassment, and Other Related Constructs
SAD may be defined as an excessive fear of violating social norms, and a concept that is closely related to violating social norms is embarrassment [56]. Singelis and Sharkey [57] have suggested that it is easier to embarrass individuals from South-East Asia because more rules for social behaviors exist there. Asian individuals should, therefore, be more concerned and worried about their social behaviour because social deviations are easier to detect. Other authors have also suggested that embarrassment is more common in collectivistic cultures because it is induced by external sanctions, whereas guilt and self-blame are more common in individualistic cultures because they are induced by internal sanctions [58,59]. Thus, there is some evidence and considerable conjecture regarding different social norms between collectivistic societies, including South-East Asian and South American societies, and individualistic societies as found in most Western countries.
A related construct that distinguishes cultural groups in SAD might be separation anxiety [60]. The authors examined the developmental progression and pattern of self-reported symptoms of SAD (SP) and separation anxiety (SA) in a community sample (n = 2,384) and a clinical sample (n = 217) of children and adolescents (aged 8–19 yrs), using a cross-sectional method. Participants were cross-classified by age, gender, and race. Using mean scores on the SP and SA subscales of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, 4 categories of children were established: High SP/High SA, High SP/Low SA, Low SP/High SA, and Low SP/Low SA. White children reported more symptoms of High SP/Low SA, while the opposite pattern was found among African-American children.
In sum, it is not yet clear whether cultural factors may work to reshape levels of social anxiety or SAD. There is little clear evidence relating to levels of symptoms of social anxiety or embarrassment across cultures, but at least some evidence has suggested possibly higher levels of social anxiety and a higher social significance of embarrassment in collectivistic relative to individualistic cultures.
Self-Construals
Self-construals are overarching schemata that define how people relate to others and the social context. On the basis of cross-cultural research, Markus and Kitayama [61] suggested that individuals from the US and other individualistic societies tend to construct and promote independent self-construals, which are characterized by one's tendency to view oneself as autonomous and separate from the social context. Individuals possessing an independent self-concept are motivated to uphold and validate their own unique, internal attributes and goals, and their self-esteem is derived from an ability to distinguish themselves from other people in their environment. In contrast, members of Asian and other Eastern cultures are more likely to value and possess interdependent self-construals, which are based upon viewing oneself as being intricately connected and integrated with others in the social group. Interdependent people view the self as an extension of the social group to which they belong. To this end, they strive to maintain harmony in various interpersonal relationships by being attentive to, adjusting their behavior to, and corresponding appropriately with the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of important others. Consistent with this notion is a study by Hong and Woody that examined Korean (n=251) and Euro-Canadian (n=250) community samples [62]. Results indicated that independent self-construal and identity consistency, views of the self that are typically associated with Western cultures, fully mediate the ethnic difference on self-reported social anxiety. Moreover, two indicators of East Asian views of the self in social contexts (interdependent self-construal and self-criticism) were partial mediators.
Although the concept of independent and interdependent self-construals was originally developed in the context of explaining cross-cultural differences in motivation and social behavior [61], and has been cited predominantly in cross-cultural research, it has since been extended to examine differences between people even within individualistic cultures, such as the United States. Along these lines, Cross and Madson argued that although both men and women value social connectedness, the American man is likely to be socialized to construct an independent self-construal and develop a social self that is marked by the motivation to promote core personal attributes over group goals [63,64]. They theorized that American men possess self-representations that they construe separately from representations of important others. Conversely, the American woman is likely to be socialized to construct an interdependent self-construal such that representations of close interpersonal others are incorporated into her definition of self, and self-representations are construed as being intricately connected with particular relationships or contexts. These gender differences in self-construals are believed to emerge in early childhood, out of the developmental learning process that occurs when boys and girls are taught what it means to be members of their respective gender groups.
Thus, according to this theory, differences in self-construals exert a pervasive influence upon the way men and women organize their experiences and assess their understanding of themselves vis-à-vis the world around them, and such differences may account for many of the empirically demonstrated gender differences in affect, social behavior, and cognitive processing. Though intriguing, this theory has, thus far, received little direct empirical validation. One pertinent question that is raised by the authors [63, 64] as well as their critics [e.g., 65] is how American women are able to reconcile the mixed messages they receive from a culture that broadly emphasizes independence and autonomy but expects females specifically to be interdependent and connected with others.
Research has demonstrated that interdependence is positively, and independence is negatively, correlated with embarrassability [57] and fear of negative evaluations [58], both of which are important elements of the symptomatic expression of social anxiety and SAD [56]. Singelis and Sharkey [57] proposed that being interdependent may engender an acute awareness of the social context and sensitivity to evaluation by others, while being independent may “gird people in the face of these evaluations” (p. 638). Similarly, Okazaki [66] suggested that highly interdependent people might be more highly attuned to social cues and the experiences of social anxiety than individuals who score low on this dimension. This hypothesis was confirmed in a cross-cultural study that examined the relationship between self-construals and social anxiety symptoms among American and Japanese university students [33].
In sum, these studies suggest that self-construal is an important variable to consider when examining the degree of social anxiety, particularly for examining individuals in East Asian cultures.
Gender Role and Gender Role Identification
Gender role and gender role identification (masculinity vs. femininity) are constructs that are closely related to self-construal. Historically, the constructs of masculinity and femininity were thought to lie on opposite ends of a unitary dimension, with femininity being associated with shyness and social subordination, and masculinity with social dominance and aggression. Almost three decades ago, however, Bem, in her classic study on psychological androgyny [67], challenged this traditional belief by reasoning that a single individual can be, “both masculine and feminine, both assertive and yielding, both instrumental and expressive” (p. 155). To test this hypothesis, Bem devised a new sex-role inventory, which treated masculinity and femininity as two independent dimensions. The Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) enabled researchers to characterize individuals as masculine, feminine, androgynous (a concept which reflected an individual's endorsement of both masculine and feminine personality characteristics), or undifferentiated, an endorsement of neither gender role.
Bem speculated, and her subsequent research confirmed [e.g., 68], that androgynous individuals are more adaptable and flexible in their behavior and perform well across a wide range of tasks. On the other hand, sex-typed individuals are motivated to restrict their behavior in accordance with cultural definitions of gender appropriateness, and perform poorly on tasks that require them to act in ways that are incongruent with their self-defined sex-type [69].
Although closely linked to social behaviors, very little research exists on gender role and gender role identification in social anxiety and SAD. A study by Moscovitch, Hofmann, and Litz [70] asked 97 American-born, Caucasian participants to complete self-report questionnaires to study the impact of gender, gender role orientation, and independent and interdependent self-construals upon social anxiety. The results showed that biological gender membership did not predict social anxiety severity. However, identification with a traditionally masculine gender role orientation decreased the risk for social anxiety, and self-construals predicted levels of social anxiety differentially in men and women. In men, interdependence and independence predicted levels of social anxiety positively and negatively, respectively, while these patterns of association were reversed in women.
In clinical samples, researchers have investigated differences between men and women in the experience and expression of social anxiety and SAD. Whereas women are slightly more likely than men to have SAD [3], men with SAD are more likely to seek treatment [56]. Men and women with SAD report similar fears of social situations, but women endorse more intense fear [71]. Because gender is a complex social construct, gender role may, in part, explain these sex differences, but this has not been examined empirically in clinical samples [e.g., 71,72].
Shame
Although shame is likely to play an important role in any culture, a particular emphasis has been placed in the literature on the relationship between shame and the Asian culture [73]. A study examining the cross-cultural differences of the effects of shame and personality on social anxiety supported this notion [74]. This study administered the Experience Scale of Shame, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Short Scale and a social anxiety measure to a Chinese sample (n=211, 66 males and 145 females, average age 20.12) and an American sample (n=211, 66 males and 145 females, average age 20.22) of college students. The structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed separately for the Chinese and American samples. The SEM results revealed a shame-mediating model in the Chinese sample only. This model did not apply for the American sample. This study supports the hypothesis that shame has a more important effect on social anxiety in the Chinese culture compared to its effect on Americans. It has been noted that shame may have different meanings in various cultural contexts [75]. In Japan, shame-prone and self-effacing behavior appears to be given positive functional value and is actively promoted by society, whereas the American culture might tend to prohibit shame-prone behaviors and the show of one's vulnerability, while encouraging the visible demonstration of one's power and capacity.

Concluding Remarks
Epidemiological studies show a wide range of lifetime prevalence rates of SAD with Asian samples having some of the lowest rates, and Russian and US samples having some of the highest rates. There appear to be culture-specific expressions of SAD, most notably Taijin kyofusho (TKS), a syndrome found in Japan and Korea. This disorder identifies people who are concerned about offending or embarrassing the other person rather than embarrassing oneself. Though TKS symptoms can be found in other cultural contexts, the symptoms cluster in particular cultural contexts and even have a particular syndrome name. Despite these differences in the cultural expression and prevalence rates, there is little evidence to support differential treatment response of SAD in individuals from different cultures. Key mechanisms were examined that produce SAD, and it was shown that these factors are influenced by culture; this suggests important areas for future research. Some of these factors include individualism/collectivism, perception of social norms, self-construal, and gender role and gender role identification.
Based on this review, we can conclude that social fears are very much dependent on a particular culture. The same social behavior may be perceived as normal in one culture and “unreasonable and excessive” in another; cultural syndromes may lead to the expectation of certain types of embarrassment in particular situations; and the meaning of SAD symptoms and their experiencing will be influenced by multiple factors—field dependence, gender role and gender role identification, local ideas of shame and what is shaming (on how cultural syndromes influence DSM disorders, see [76, 77]). People with SAD fear violating the perceived social norms of the social reference group they identify themselves with. The social reference group not only includes the cultural/racial/ethnic group, but also gender identification, social status, and sexual orientation. In certain cultural groups, certain social situations and certain symptoms, actions, and “failures” may be the cause of particular shame; these shame syndromes associated with particular situations may take the form of a syndrome that has a particular name, such as the case of TKS. An important research area is how persons in various cultures treat these SAD symptoms, as well as syndromes like TKS (e.g., the treatment of TKS by Morita therapy), fear of body odor, fear of blushing, etc in Asian and other cultures. This may give insight into the mechanisms generating the disorder (including the genetic contribution), and how culturally appropriate treatment can be conducted
What are the implications for the DSM-V definition of SAD? Our review indicates that SAD varies by key socio-cultural factors, including collectivism/individualism, perception of social norms, self-construal, gender roles, and gender roles identification. This suggests that SAD should be defined in relation to the particular reference group because the same social behavior can be perceived very differently in different socio-cultural subgroups. Therefore, the person's socio-cultural background needs to be carefully taken into consideration when evaluating social behaviors and attitudes. These issues should be included in the DSM-V text and should be part of the definitional criteria so that clinicians are encouraged to evaluate the symptoms in relation to the patient's socio-cultural background (for a further discussion of changes to the SA criteria in the DSM, see [78]).
The study is limited by the nature of the relatively modest quantity and quality of existing studies, which include a high percentage of American samples. Furthermore, we focused our discussion primarily on the cultural difference in the rates of SAD and selectively reviewed the existing literature on the cultural expression of social anxiety. We suggest that future studies more closely examine cultural differences in the degree and expression of social anxiety symptoms. An important research area is how persons in various cultures treat these SAD symptoms, as well as syndromes like TKS (e.g., the treatment of TKS by Morita therapy), fear of body odor, fear of blushing, etc in Asian and other cultures. This may give insight into the mechanisms generating the disorder (including the genetic contribution), and how culturally appropriate treatment can be conducted.

What is ammonia?
Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most commonly produced industrial chemicals in the United States. It is used in industry and commerce, and also exists naturally in humans and in the environment. Ammonia is essential for many biological processes and serves as a precursor for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. In the environment, ammonia is part of the nitrogen cycle and is produced in soil from bacterial processes. Ammonia is also produced naturally from decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals and animal wastes.
Some chemical/physical properties of ammonia are:
At room temperature, ammonia is a colorless, highly irritating gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.
In pure form, it is known as anhydrous ammonia and is hygroscopic (readily absorbs moisture).
Ammonia has alkaline properties and is corrosive.
Ammonia gas dissolves easily in water to form ammonium hydroxide, a caustic solution and weak base.
Ammonia gas is easily compressed and forms a clear liquid under pressure.
Ammonia is usually shipped as a compressed liquid in steel containers.
Ammonia is not highly flammable, but containers of ammonia may explode when exposed to high heat.
How is ammonia used?
About 80% of the ammonia produced by industry is used in agriculture as fertilizer. Ammonia is also used as a refrigerant gas, for purification of water supplies, and in the manufacture of plastics, explosives, textiles, pesticides, dyes and other chemicals. It is found in many household and industrial-strength cleaning solutions. Household ammonia cleaning solutions are manufactured by adding ammonia gas to water and can be between 5 and 10% ammonia. Ammonia solutions for industrial use may be concentrations of 25% or higher and are corrosive.
How can people be exposed to ammonia?
Most people are exposed to ammonia from inhalation of the gas or vapors. Since ammonia exists naturally and is also present in cleaning products, exposure may occur from these sources. The widespread use of ammonia on farms and in industrial and commercial locations also means that exposure can occur from an accidental release or from a deliberate terrorist attack.
Anhydrous ammonia gas is lighter than air and will rise, so that generally it dissipates and does not settle in low-lying areas. However, in the presence of moisture (such as high relative humidity), the liquefied anhydrous ammonia gas forms vapors that are heavier than air. These vapors may spread along the ground or into low-lying areas with poor airflow where people may become exposed.
What is ammonia’s mechanism of action?
Ammonia interacts immediately upon contact with available moisture in the skin, eyes, oral cavity, respiratory tract, and particularly mucous surfaces to form the very caustic ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium hydroxide causes the necrosis of tissues through disruption of cell membrane lipids (saponification) leading to cellular destruction. As cell proteins break down, water is extracted, resulting in an inflammatory response that causes further damage.
What are the immediate health effects of ammonia exposure?
Inhalation: Ammonia is irritating and corrosive. Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia in air causes immediate burning of the nose, throat and respiratory tract. This can cause bronchiolar and alveolar edema, and airway destruction resulting in respiratory distress or failure. Inhalation of lower concentrations can cause coughing, and nose and throat irritation. Ammonia's odor provides adequate early warning of its presence, but ammonia also causes olfactory fatigue or adaptation, reducing awareness of one's prolonged exposure at low concentrations.
Children exposed to the same concentrations of ammonia vapor as adults may receive a larger dose because they have greater lung surface area-to-body weight ratios and increased minute volumes-to-weight ratios. In addition, they may be exposed to higher concentrations than adults in the same location because of their shorter height and the higher concentrations of ammonia vapor initially found near the ground.
Skin or eye contact: Exposure to low concentrations of ammonia in air or solution may produce rapid skin or eye irritation. Higher concentrations of ammonia may cause severe injury and burns. Contact with concentrated ammonia solutions such as industrial cleaners may cause corrosive injury including skin burns, permanent eye damage or blindness. The full extent of eye injury may not be apparent for up to a week after the exposure. Contact with liquefied ammonia can also cause frostbite injury.
Ingestion: Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia from swallowing ammonia solution results in corrosive damage to the mouth, throat and stomach. Ingestion of ammonia does not normally result in systemic poisoning.
How is ammonia exposure treated?
There is no antidote for ammonia poisoning, but ammonia's effects can be treated, and most people recover. Immediate decontamination of skin and eyes with copious amounts of water is very important. Treatment consists of supportive measures and can include administration of humidified oxygen, bronchodilators and airway management. Ingested ammonia is diluted with milk or water.
Will laboratory tests assist in making treatment decisions if someone has been exposed to ammonia?
Laboratory testing for ammonia exposure will not be useful in making emergency treatment decisions. Medical tests that can detect ammonia in blood or urine are available. However, because ammonia is normally found in the body, these test results cannot serve as biomarkers of exposure. After exposure to low levels, ammonia is either rapidly cleared from the body or metabolized to compounds found endogenously at appreciable levels. Clinical indices of body ammonia or nitrogen levels after exposure to exogenous ammonia have shown no or minimal change from prior levels. Exposure to high concentrations is immediately and overtly toxic, generally providing an adequate basis for diagnosis.

Baucus, Hatch, Camp Levin Call on USTR to Hold Russia to High Standard in WTO Negotiations to Promote U.S. Jobs, Economy
Trade Committee Leaders Call for Protection of U.S. Intellectual Property Rights, Commitment from Russia to Join the Information Technology Agreement and Address Agriculture and Autos Investment Issues in Russia’s WTO Accession
Washington, DC – Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Ranking Member Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), with House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) and Ranking Member Sander Levin (D-Mich.) urged U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk to insist that Russia meet a high standard to promote U.S. jobs and ensure a level playing field for U.S. businesses and workers in the negotiations for Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).  The Chairmen and Ranking Members of the committees with jurisdiction over international trade expressed concern regarding:
Russia’s protection of intellectual property rights, which are critical to U.S. industry and jobs;
Recent reports questioning Russia’s commitment to join the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), one of the most successful WTO agreements, providing duty free treatment to a vast array of information and communications technology (ICT) products, with tremendous benefits to the innovative U.S. high tech sector as well as the many U.S. industries that use ICT to enhance their productivity and competitiveness at home and abroad;
Russia’s actions blocking market access for U.S. agricultural products through unscientific health and safety requirements; and
Russia’s auto investment regime’s impact on U.S. autos and auto parts companies, and their  workers.
“We are writing to urge you to insist that Russia meet a high standard in the ongoing negotiations regarding Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization,” the Committee leaders wrote to Ambassador Kirk.  “While we recognize that Russia has made progress in opening its economy since 1991, the accession should address the serious problems that remain.”
The full text of the letter is below.
October 29, 2011
Ambassador Ron Kirk
United States Trade Representative
Office of the United States Trade Representative
600 17th Street NW
Washington, DC 20508
Dear Ambassador Kirk:
We are writing to urge you to insist that Russia meet a high standard in the ongoing negotiations regarding Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).  While we recognize that Russia has made progress in opening its economy since 1991, the accession should address the serious problems that remain. 
As you know, both Houses of Congress must vote to remove Russia from Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 before the United States can expect to enjoy the full benefits of Russian membership in the WTO.  A high standard accession package will be essential to ensuring support for granting Russia permanent normal trade relations by removing it from Title IV.
We have numerous concerns regarding Russia’s protection of intellectual property rights (IPR).  Intellectual property is critical to U.S. industry and jobs. We believe it is vitally important for potential members of the WTO to demonstrate that they are not only willing to agree to strong protection of intellectual property, but that they also possess the will and the ability to enforce these rights. Unfortunately, Russia’s standard of IPR protection has fallen short of these standards.
We are also deeply concerned about recent reports questioning Russia’s commitment to join the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), a commitment the United States negotiated with Russia as part of the bilateral agreement we reached in 2006.  The ITA is one of the most successful WTO agreements, providing duty free treatment to a vast array of information and communications technology (ICT) products, with tremendous benefits to the innovative U.S. high tech sector as well as the many U.S. industries that use ICT to enhance their productivity and competitiveness at home and abroad.  The United States has consistently pursued a policy of requiring both new WTO candidates and free trade agreement partners to join the ITA.
We urge you to ensure that Russia fulfills its commitment to join and participate fully in the ITA without delay, as well as all other commitments made as part of the accession process.  We know that many are eager for Russia to join the WTO as soon as possible, but for the sake of U.S. companies and workers, we must ensure that the deal achieves our high standards.
We must also emphasize the importance of ensuring that Russia is prepared, and willing, to comply with the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement.  Russia’s track record in this area has not been good.  It has blocked market access for certain U.S. agricultural products through unscientific health and safety requirements, and it has provided little or no guidance about how to comply with these requirements.  Russia’s actions have directly blocked U.S. exports and created significant uncertainty for U.S. exporters.  Russia must also commit to lower its tariff and quota barriers to U.S. agriculture products.   
Finally, we are also concerned about Russia’s autos investment policy. We urge that you ensure that Russia’s autos investment regime, as well as any agreement negotiated between Russia and the European Union related to that regime, not disadvantage our autos or auto parts companies or workers. 
There are many challenges to be negotiated, the totality of which will determine Congressional support for Russia’s WTO accession. Russia’s protection of intellectual property, commitment to join the ITA, satisfactory commitments on agriculture and SPS issues, and commitment to address problematic investment policies, will be significant considerations.
Sincerely,

Abstract
Phages as bactericidal agents have been employed for 90 years as a means of treating bacterial infections in humans as well as other species, a process known as phage therapy. In this review we explore both the early historical and more modern use of phages to treat human infections. We discuss in particular the little-reviewed French early work, along with the Polish, US, Georgian and Russian historical experiences. We also cover other, more modern examples of phage therapy of humans as differentiated in terms of disease. In addition, we provide discussions of phage safety, other aspects of phage therapy pharmacology, and the idea of phage use as probiotics.

Introduction
Phage therapy involves the targeted application of bacteriophages that, upon encounter with specific pathogenic bacteria, can infect and kill them. As typically practiced, phages then lyse those bacteria, releasing virion progeny that can continue the cycle, including migrating to other sites of infection anywhere in the body. The actual phage-mediated bacterial killing, however, occurs well prior to the lysis step—e.g., such as in the first minutes of infection for a phage such as phage T4 1—as the phage converts the cell into a factory for making new phages. Phages are unique among antibacterial agents in their ability to increase their numbers when in the presence of bacterial targets. Of similar importance, phages only minimally impact non-target bacteria or body tissues. A more complete list of advantages associated with phage therapy, relative particularly to chemical antibacterials, is presented in this issue2 and elsewhere.3 Here we review the potential for phages to treat bacterial infections afflicting humans. Other therapeutic applications, such as in veterinary medicine, have been reviewed in reference 4, and will be also covered in future issues of this journal. Other reviews focusing on various aspects of human phage therapy are also available.3,5–11

History of Phage Therapy
The viruses of bacteria were discovered in 1915 by Frederick Twort.12 The “bacteriophage” era, however, did not begin until the seminal publication demonstrating “un bactériophage obligatoire” by Félix d'Hérelle in 1917.13 Microbiologists subsequently began to incorporate the idea of phages into their world view, with phage therapy almost immediately coming to play a central role in the development of the field. Indeed, one can readily trace the progression of phage biology as starting with an early, enthusiastic period during which claims were excessive and often unrealistic, while at the same time little was understood of the viral nature of phages or their strengths and limitations (early 1920s into the 1930s). An important exception to these concerns, most closely associated with the concept of phage therapy as practiced during these early years, and as formulated in impressive detail, is the work of Felix d'Hérelle (see “France,” below).
This time of excessive expectations was followed by a period of declining enthusiasm for phage therapy in much of the western world, subsequent displacement of its use after World War II by antibiotics, and a shift in focus to using phages as model genetic systems. This second stage started with the quite critical 1934 Eaton-Bayne-Jones report14–16 reviewing the available literature on phage therapy3 and continued through the late 1940s. At the same time, development of phage therapy and its active application continued to increase within the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, where it was well supported until the fall of the Soviet Union. In the West, the golden age of phage-based development of molecular biology involved intense work with just a few phages infecting one avirulent lab host (E. coli B) rather than broad exploration of phages targeting a range of key pathogens.
Subsequently, phage therapy was “rediscovered” by the English-language literature starting with the work of Smith and Huggins in the 1980s.17–20 This western phage therapy renaissance gained momentum only in the 1990s, however, as access was increasingly gained to the rich trove of Soviet and Polish work. The field finally began maturing from those heady “wild west” days of the 1990s starting approximately in the year 2000, a progression that was coupled with an explosion of genomics and broad ecology-based phage research, with this latest era of phage therapy research as well as application continuing to this day. Over the rest of this section we provide an outline of phage therapy development in different parts of the world with special emphasis on France, which we cover over three sections; this extensive and well-documented French work has been largely ignored in previous reviews, presumably due to the language barrier. For additional reading, the history of phage therapy has been recounted in some depth and from various perspectives in a number of reviews3,10,21–23 and the history of phage biology too has also been extensively reviewed in reference 24–28.
France.
Human phage therapy has been practiced in France since 1919, when d'Hérelle first successfully treated several children at the Hospital des Enfants Malades in Paris who were suffering from severe dysentery, using the phage he had first isolated from the stools of soldiers he had observed at the Pasteur Institute.3,22,29 He delayed both publication and further clinical work, though, until he had carried out very extensive studies of the properties of phages, particularly those relevant to clinical applications, with work especially in fowl typhoid and in cholera. His study of the role of phages in combating infections are laid out in a series of books,30–38 including five that have been translated from French into English.36,39–42 His methods for the preparation of therapeutic phages were particularly well laid out in an appendix accompanying one of his later works, the first English translation of which is found elsewhere in this issue.43 However, although d'Hérelle carried out the first human therapeutic phage trial, the first article documenting phage therapy was on research conducted in Belgium by Bruynoghe and Maisin in 1921.44 They reported that injecting phages targeting Staphylococcus near the base of cutaneous boils (furuncles and carbuncles), in six patients, led to improvement within 48 hours: reduction in pain and swelling and some reduction in fever.
Subsequent phage therapy work in humans is reviewed in 1931 by d'Hérelle45,46 who also describes the first use of intravenous bacteriophage, which was used in the treatment of cholera by Asheshov in India. In addition, at his suggestion, Dr. Davioud in France was able to cure a “hopeless” case of staphylococcal bacteremia. Five mL of a suspension of staphylococcal phages was diluted in 500 mL of physiological saline and infused over one hour. d'Hérelle also described the intravenous use of phages for Streptococcus by Gratia. Further use of intravenous phage in France is outlined below.
Much other work in the field rapidly followed in France. D'Hérelle, for instance, went on to establish his own Laboratoire du Bactériophage, run by his son in law, Theodore Mazure, which produced the first commercial phage cocktails—Bacté-Coli-Phage, Bacté-Intesti-Phage, Bacté-Dysentérie-Phage, Bacté-Pyo-Phage and Bacté-Rhino-Phage. Although France is clearly a western country, most of the reviews of phage therapy have not mentioned the continuation of phage therapy in France, which had been ongoing with some vigor until the early 90s, with the commercial phages from d'Hérelle's previous company available until 1978. The following detailed discussion of phage therapy as historically practiced in France draws both on the very interesting recent monograph by Dublanchet47 and translations made by Kuhl of the original French literature.
Lang et al.48 reported the use of bacteriophage in seven patients with chronic orthopedic infections with resistant organisms. They were able to cure two cases of hip prostheses infected with gram-negative bacteria (after removal of the prostheses), one case of tibial osteomyelitis due to Proteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella; one case of septic arthritis of the knee due to Enterobacter and Staphylococcus aureus, and one case of septic non-union of the femur due to pan-resistant Providencia. A surgical site infection associated with Harrington rods also showed improvement: The staphylococcal infection was eradicated, but the Pseudomonas infection persisted. One case of a post-traumatic septic knee, with variable flora associated with a chronic pseudomonal infection, however, relapsed after apparent improvement and was counted as a failure.
There continued to be regular literature reports on phage therapy in France until at least 1979 (cf. 49 and 50). Henri de Montclos spent the majority of his career at the Pasteur Institute of Lyon where he was Chief of Clinical Microbiology for 10 years and he and his research team produced antistaphyloccal vaccines and therapeutic phages until the early 1990s. In his 2002 review,51 he described how several European laboratories maintained an individualized, essentially artisan-like production of phages by classical methods until the 1980s. He stated that phages appear to be safe for human cells though potentially there could be problems associated with modes of preparation. Among his recommendations is purification from pyrogen released by the lysing of bacteria, for example by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. He also recommended against propagation on media produced from animal tissues. Successful treatment was typically achieved in a few weeks and there was a general impression of a real service rendered, although this individualized approach did not lend itself to double-blind study establishing proof. After the AIDS crisis in the blood supply, regulations within the public health system became less conducive to continued production of pharmaceuticals, including phages, in this individualized manner.
A few French physicians have continued to use phages therapeutically even after the Pasteur Institute stopped making therapeutic cocktails in the mid 1990's, now generally obtaining their phages from Russia or Georgia.47 Staphylococcus infections seem to be the most common target of these more-recent efforts. Dublanchet and colleagues have recently reported successful phage therapy of two patients from France and one from Australia who had failed other therapies, including all available antibiotics.52
La Médicine (1936).
A full 1936 monograph issue of the journal La Médicine in 1936 was devoted to phage therapy. Its individual reviews give detailed data on the treatment of such conditions as typhoid fever, acute colitis, peritonitis, prostate and urinary tract infections, furunculosis, sepsis and otolaryngology. For example:
Mikeladze53 described the treatment of 21 patients with typhoid fever with per os bacteriophage, using 10 mL of lysate for three to five consecutive days. Compared to 64 controls treated by the usual methods, they noted a reduction in mortality from 15.6% to 4.8% and a reduction in complications from 56.2% to 13%. There was a doubling of the recurrence rate from 4.5% to 9.5%, however, when phage treatment was delayed until between the tenth and fifteenth day of illness. The duration of illness was essentially the same, though. Subsequently, they used intravenous phages for patients whose blood cultures yielded the typhoid bacillus, infusing one mL of phages daily for three consecutive days. The duration of illness was decreased, but “violent reactions” were seen after the injection. Following d'Hérelle's advice, they then began using phage cultured in the absence of peptone, slowly infusing 3 to 5 mL in 200 mL of physiological saline. They still observed severe reactions before a rapid fall in temperature, and decided to reserve this treatment for young patients with a healthy cardiovascular system, preferably treated early, before the typhoid had weakened the patient. In general, they also decided to decrease each dose, but repeat the injections.
Mikeladze53 also described the treatment of “acute colitis” due to Shigella or Salmonella in Georgia. One ampoule (5 mL) of bacti-intesti-phage diluted in boiled and cooled water was administered orally every 2 hours. The patients ingested a total of 8–10 ampoules while taking a liquid diet. In general, they noted that phages caused a decrease in temperature and an improvement in the patient's feeble and rapid pulse, intestinal pain and tenesmus. In unfavorable cases, treated late in infection, the improvement was still considerable, although the colitis tended to persist. They found that a second series of ampoules, given after a day of rest, always yielded good results. In 47 cases of dysentery, 3 died (6.4%), which is half the usual mortality. Of 43 patients with colitis, all were cured.
Tsouloukidze54 discussed the phage treatment of twenty patients with peritonitis caused by intestinal perforation in typhoid fever. After surgical laparotomy and the repair of the perforation, they administered 8 to 20 mL of a mixture of equal parts of Bacté-Pyo-Phage and Bacté-Intesti-Phage, undiluted. The peritoneal cavity was then completely closed surgically, without drains or dressing. The mortality was reduced from 85% to 20–35%, depending on how they counted two patients who died four and five days after surgery without peritoneal signs. He felt they had enough data to energetically recommend phage therapy for all cases of peritonitis, and particularly for perforations caused by typhoid.
Gougerot and Peyre55 described the treatment of skin infections using phages, with particular emphasis on recurrent furunculosis. Local treatment was best, but each pustule needed to be opened with a phage-containing syringe. Then a pad moistened with phage was rubbed over the area and a compress dampened with phage was used as the dressing. The next day they observed that each pustule had increased in size and was surrounded by an indurated, red zone of inflammation. But after 48 hours, the lesions would dry up and disappear. They repeated this every two days for new or overlooked pustules, with improvement in nearly all cases. After eight or ten applications, most of the patients were cured. In cases of bacterial infection of the dermis and epidermis, such as impetigo, they recommended unroofing the lesions, removing the crusts, opening bullous lesions and rubbing a bit roughly in order to introduce the phages into the skin, then applying a large compress moistened with the same bacteriophages. As with abscesses, it was helpful to advise the patient to expect a worsening of inflammation in the first 24 hours, prior to improvement.
Sauvé56 described the treatment of surgical infections with bacteriophages. He noted the availability of extremely polyvalent phages which lysed approximately 90% of strains of Staphylococcus from both Gratia and d'Hérelle, and recommended using stock bacteriophages. On the anal margin, he had obtained surprising cures of voluminous abscesses, in two or three days, without resulting fistulas and without surgical intervention. He noted that breast abscesses, dental abscesses and many others could be cured by phage therapy without the expense of anesthesia nor the long recovery necessitated by surgery. He was surprised that a method so simple, so brilliant, and so effective had not become more common, but felt it would with time. For chronic staphylococcal infections, he recommended not injecting subcutaneously to avoid stimulating the production of antibodies to phages. For minor, non-life-threatening infections, he recommended drainage of the abscess followed by injection of phages into the abscess cavity. Sauvé further studied streptococcal infections with Sertic and Boulgakov from d'Hérelle's laboratory, who prepared a polyvalent streptophage active against 50% of streptococcal strains. As streptococcal infections are less prevalent than staphylococcal infections, he recommended treatment with a mixture of staphylococcal and streptococcal phages until the organism could be identified. He also discussed the effectiveness of phages for the treatment of coliform infections, noting that the available phage cocktails were becoming more and more polyvalent. However, in many urinary tract infections there were difficult-to-treat strains, and it had been necessary to adapt a coliphage for the resistant strains. He concluded that phage therapy was more efficacious and less dangerous than other methods, particularly vaccination.
Sauvé56 continued with the use of phages in septicemia, and described the cure of 9 cases of staphylococcal infection. They diluted 4 to 6 mL of phage cultivated in broth without peptone (to avoid the shock induced by peptone) into 200 mL of nontoxic serum, which was slowly infused over 40 to 50 minutes. “The temperature is taken every 2 hours to record the lysis. When it occurs it is massive and accompanied by shock. The temperature falls within 3–5 hours to 37–40 degrees and below. From the time of the decrease in temperature, the patient feels truly reborn; his face brightens, and the observer sees a true resurrection. The theoretical objections to the intravenous treatment with phage and the possibility of introducing unlysed filtered pathogens do not hold up against the fact of definitive cure.” He had observed no fatalities with treatment, but noted that this treatment does not work in terminal cases associated with rapid decline. He used a second and third injection at two-day intervals in cases of incomplete lysis. No other method, including serotherapy, had achieved these results. He had also published a case of treatment of a severe case of coliform septicemia which was cured within 24 hours of intravenous bacteriophage infusion. He emphasized that phage therapy should always be preceded by surgical treatment including incision and drainage, which is then followed by debridement if necrotic tissue is present.
Michon57 described the treatment of urinary tract infections. He stated that it was necessary to first alkalinize the urine. After evacuation of the bladder, they infused phage for three consecutive days. Twenty mL were instilled into the bladder on the first and second days and 10 mL on the third day. The patient continued urinary antiseptic treatments for the entire period, including three to four days following the infusion of phage. In cases of uretero-prostatitis, they instilled the phage to the area of the posterior urethra. For pyelonephritis, he recommended alkalinization of the urine, renal lavage with 20 to 30 mL of phages followed by urethral lavage, and then phage instillation into the bladder. They noted much less relapse than they had seen with silver nitrate treatment.
Halphen58 described the use of phage therapy in otolaryngology. He noted the treatment of furunculosis of external otitis, but noted that general anesthesia or great bravery on the part of the patient was necessary for the injection of phage into the already-inflamed cartilage. A second treatment was often needed two days later, but they concluded that if these first two treatments were not effective, then the phages used were not effectively lysing the bacterial strain. They had also used phages in dressings applied to the nasal furuncles with success. They treated furuncles of the upper lip (known in the pre-antibiotic era as the danger triangle) with several mL of lysate without anesthesia. “Immediately the lip swells greatly and very painfully, but after 5–6 hours, the drainage from the incision becomes serous (i.e., yellow, transparent and benign), and within 24 hours, the patient is cured.”
Summary of Pasteur Institute reviews.
A 1961 review in French by J.F. Vieu59 of the Bacteriophages Service of the Pasteur Institute summarized the fundamentals of phage therapy in France at that time, noting that bacteriophage were particularly useful in the treatment of Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Proteus and coliforms. His key points about their approach included statements that:
Only virulent phages that completely lyse the bacterial culture in vitro were used in therapy. The liquid lysates, typically containing 108 to 109 virions per mL, were filtered through a Chamberland filter.
The media in which the lysates were prepared was of utmost importance when administered intravenously, and even more so when administered intrathecally. The media that were best tolerated contained the least amounts of large protein molecules. Well-tolerated molecules included broth, peptone water and synthetic as well as semi-synthetic media.
Two categories of therapeutic bacteriophages were utilized: bacteriophage stocks (cocktails) and adapted bacteriophage. The phage stocks had a broad spectrum of activity, while the adapted phages were prepared for specific bacterial strains.
The efficacy of a minimally virulent phage was improved by repeated passage through the same bacterial strain. When the preparation of an adapted staphylococcal phage was necessary, the delay of several days needed for their propagation was typically compensated by their remarkable efficacy.
There were multiple modalities of administration: Local application and subcutaneous injection were used in the first staphylococcal trials, and required no particular precautions. They remained the methods of choice when the bacteriophage could be placed in contact with the infectious site. In the particular cases of intrapleural or pericardial injection, it was preferable to use lysates prepared as for intravenous injection. Per os delivery also was possible, with the introduction of phages into the GI tract of mice resulting in virions circulating into the blood.60 See reference 61 for a recent review and discussion of phage transfer from the human gut to the blood.
Vieu discussed the potential for interference by phage-neutralizing antibodies, a common concern, which might appear after repeated injections of therapeutic phage. He concluded that extending phage treatment for long enough for antibodies to become a problem shows an error in judgment, as typically phage therapy should at least begin to be effective within a few days or one should consider adding another phage that does not cross-react serologically.
In 1975, Vieu49 tabulated the 476 phages isolated and prepared by the Bacteriophage Service at the Pasteur Institute from 1969 through June 1974, most of which targeted Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, E. coli and Serratia. Staphylococcal infection was the major indication for phage therapy. Among 90 phage requests to the Pasteur Bacteriophage Service in 1959–60, more than half concerned staphylococcal infections. These included septicemia with endocarditis, chronic osteomyelitis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, pulmonary and sinus infections, pyelonephritis, skin infections and furunculosis, and represented situations in which clinical and bacteriological cure had not been achieved by extensive antibiotic treatment. Indeed, most of the staphylococcal strains sent to the laboratory with requests for adapted bacteriophages were resistant in vitro to multiple antibiotics.59 Overall the Pasteur Institute of Lyon appears to have produced over 60 therapeutic phages in 197651: about 20 phages for enterobacteria, about 30 for Pseudomonas, and over 10 for Staphylococcus.
Many of the details of phage administration and its effects as described in the 1936 La Médicine special monograph and as discussed by Vieu59 still appear valid in light of today's knowledge and information from other sources. The data and conclusions presented there are in stark contrast to the phage-therapy-critical 1934 14–16 and 1941 62,63 JAMA reviews (see below, and as discussed in some detail in ref. 3). A reasonable inference is that phage therapy worked when the phages were manufactured and administered correctly and, not surprisingly, far less so when they were not. The latter was all too often true in much of Europe and the US in the early days of phage therapy, as considered below; see also reference 3, 9, 16 and 19.
Poland.
Thousands of patients have been treated with phages in Poland, particularly in association with the Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy in Wrocńaw, which was founded in 1954. This work has been more thoroughly documented than any other in the English-language literature, mainly in the Institute's own journal in the earlier years and much of the work is available at their web site, www.aite.wroclaw.pl, and/or at www.evergreen.edu/phage. Treatment was performed by physicians from throughout the region, using phages specifically selected and prepared for each patient from the large Institute collection, and with detailed records kept. Every one of their 550 patients from 1981–1986 were included in a series of overview articles and specific discussions of particular conditions.64–70 Reported cure rates for specific infection types ranged from 75 to 100%.64
As with much of the ongoing clinical use of phages, these results represent phage use more as a standard of care than an experimental application, with a typical approach as discussed by Slopek et al. (see ref. 64, p. 570) which we quote:
In phage therapy the use was made of virulent bacteriophages, i.e., inducing a complete lysis of bacterial strains isolated from patients. Bacteriophages were administered orally 3 times daily in the dose of 10 ml before the meal, after previous neutralization of gastric juice. Phages were also used locally as moist applications to pleural, peritoneal, cavities, urinary bladder and as eye, ear and nose drops. In the course of treatment, sensitivity of isolated bacteria to phages applied was under control; in the case of confirmed resistance, bacteriophages were changed.
Often these were treatments of last resort for chronic bacterial infections that had not responded to standard antibiotic treatment. Such infections are among the most difficult to successfully treat. Indeed, as noted on p. 582 of the same publication, “Unfavorable treatment results may be accounted, to a great extent, to too late initiation of the treatment and also great cachexy of patients with long course of disease.” In this vein, however carefully phages were chosen and whatever the nature of the problem, the fundamental health of the patient was also a key factor in the effectiveness of phage therapy, implying utility to not excessively delaying phage application. Thus, for example, Slopek et al.68 report 84.2% positive results given “severe” disease versus 92.8% for “medium-severe” and 96.9% for “generally good”.
Because most of these infections had neither spontaneously resolved nor yielded to antibiotic therapy over long periods prior to phage application, positive results observed after phage treatment have been taken as a strong indication of phage-associated efficacy. However, since these treatments (1) were not blinded, (2) are not presented for all cases in great detail, and (3) since antibiotics were occasionally used in parallel, many have questioned to what extent these apparently impressive results can be considered as definitive proof of phage therapy efficacy from the perspective of western medicine.
Since 2005, the institute itself has had a phage therapy center dedicated especially to treating antibiotic-resistance infections. As Poland is now a member of the European Union, this clinical phage application is being conducted officially within the purview of a western medical regulatory system. The Polish phage therapy experience has been the subject of numerous reviews, particularly as generated by the practitioners themselves, including Beata Weber-Dabrowska, Andrzej Górski, and the late Stefan Slopek;6,8,71 see also in reference 11 and below for further discussion.
United States.
Interest in phages and the use of phage therapy spread quickly to the United States during the above-noted “enthusiastic period”, that is, the 1920s and 1930s, which has been described in some detail in reference 3, 16 and 19. One of the first studies of subcutaneous phage administration was carried out at the Michigan Department of Health, where Larkum72 reported treating 208 patients with chronic furunculosis; 78% of them had no recurring infections for at least 6 months after treatment and only 3% showed no improvement. Schultz73 and Schless74 reported remarkable success with staphylococcal septicemia and meningitis, respectively.
Several well-known pharmaceutical companies became actively involved in efforts to produce therapeutic phage preparations in the 1930's. Eli Lilly, for example, produced sterile-filtered phage-lysates (Staphylo-lysate, Colo-lysate, Ento-lysate, Neiso-lysate) and the same preparations in a water-soluble jelly base (e.g., Staphylo-jel) for treating abscesses, purulent wounds, vaginitis, mastoiditis and respiratory infections. As reported by Straub and Applebaum,75 E.R. Squibb and Sons and a division of Abbott Labs were also involved in commercial therapeutic phage production. Unfortunately, they found that all of them had problems with quality control, stability and establishment of efficacy. For example, they analyzed several lots of commercial phage preparations made by each of the 3 manufacturers and found that several had very low activity titers, presumably due to some of the additives they contained. D'Hérelle also reported that some commercial preparations contained no detectable biologically active phage.26
In a year-long American Medical Association review of phage therapy, Eaton and Bayne-Jones14–16 thoroughly explored over 100 studies of therapeutic phage applications and raised many serious questions, as discussed in some detail by Sulakvelidze and Kutter.2 Their discouraging JAMA report found consistent, convincing data only for the treatment of localized staphylococcal infections and for cystitis, and the review generally had a dramatically negative impact on the opinions of the medical and scientific communities. As in France, Staphylococcus nevertheless continued to be a major focus of phage therapeutic efforts. Working in New York, MacNeal and Frisbee76 described their relatively successful treatment of staphylococcal bacteremia in 100 patients. MacNeal et al.77 subsequently reported very positive results in the cumulative treatment of 500 patients with staphylococcal bacteremia, using cocktails of phages that were lytic in vitro. More details of the early work on Staphylococcus are included in the sections on MRSA and on purulent infections under “Treatment of Specific Diseases”, below.
While the 1934 review made a real effort to deal with the complexities of the then-available English-language literature, a subsequent 1941 JAMA review by Krueger and Scribner62,63 reflected a singular lack of care in researching the available data, if not outright personal bias in the conclusions. Unfortunately, both had profoundly negative and long-lasting effects on general US attitudes about the potential of phage therapy.
In 1942, editorials in the Lancet and British Medical Journal on Soviet military use of phages against dysentery and gangrene led the US National Research Council/CMR to sponsor a variety of successful and interesting animal studies with phages targeting Shigella dysenteriae. René Dubos, who had been very impressed with what he had seen of d'Hérelle's work when they were at Rockefeller and Yale, respectively, was the best known of those who took on the NRC challenge, and obtained important results that still are among the best illustrations of why phages can be so effective. Dubos et al.78 reported in vivo lysis of bacteria, with multiplication of bacteriophages as protective against experimental infection of mice with S. dysenteriae. The bacteria were injected intracerebrally while the phages were injected intraperitoneally, meaning that phages had to get into the bloodstream and then cross the blood-brain barrier to reach their bacterial host. He reported 72% survival if the mice were treated with 107 to 109 phages, versus only 3.6% with no treatment, and went on to study the phage distribution in the blood and brain with and without the infecting bacteria (see Fig. 1). Injection of phages that were heat-inactivated or that did not target the infecting bacteria afforded no protection.
Figure 1
This figure, based on the data in the 1943 mouse studies of Rene Dubos,78 provides significant insight into why phage therapy works well even in treating infections that antibiotics can't reach. When he injected the mice intraperitoneally with 109 phages, they quickly appeared in the blood stream, entering the brain, but they were rapidly cleared. However, if the mice were also injected intracerebrally with Shigella dysenteriae, the host for these phages, then 46/64 of the mice survived (as compared with 3/84 in the absence of appropriate viable phage) and the brain level of phage climbed to over 109 per gram. Once the bacteria were cleared, phage levels dropped below detection limits.
Further data refuting many of the conclusions of the JAMA reviews14–16,62,63 were published by Morton and Perez-Otero79 who noted an increase in bacteriophages in vivo during experimental infections with Shigella paradysenteriae. Even after the widespread introduction of antibiotics in the early 1940's, phages were still used successfully to treat typhoid fever, which was refractory to the antibiotics available at that time. Human typhoid work went on in Los Angeles with increasing success from 1936 to 1949.
At a January, 2001, AstraZeneca Research Foundation conference on drug discovery and development in Bangalore and later on line, Gary Schoolnik, then Chief of Infectious Diseases at Stanford, described what led him to enter the field of microbiology (see also ref. 80). Quoting Schoolnik:
My mother, in 1948, was dying of typhoid fever, before they had antibiotics. My father… read in J. Bacteriology about a Los Angeles scientist who had discovered a phage that killed Salmonella typhi. He called up this guy, and it was flown up to us in Seattle on a DC-3. My father injected my mother in the hospital with this phage, and the next day she was perfectly well… That's real infectious disease experimentation: a mix of science, and daring and desperation.
He only later learned that there was much data that laid a solid foundation for this life-saving decision, not just the mouse work he was aware of. Beginning in 1936, for example, many human typhoid patients had been treated with phages in Los Angeles, with increasing success. As reported by Knouf et al. “One of the most spectacular accomplishments… was the rapidity with which the patient returned to his normal mental outlook. In 24–46 hours, patients who had been comatose and in the ‘typhoid state’ amazed everyone by cheerful, grateful attitude… asked for food vociferously”. Similar work was going on in the province of Quebec, as reported by Desranleau.82 Various formulations of Vi-specific phages were used to treat nearly 100 typhoid patients, at least some of them intravenously with no serious side effects. One of their most effective formulations, containing 6 phages, reduced the mortality from 20% to 2%. However, once chloramphenicol was available for the treatment of typhoid, reports of work with phages seem to have stopped.
As mentioned at the beginning of this section on the history of phage therapy, the renewed realization in the US that phages represented a possible if partial solution to the problem of antibiotic resistance began in the 1990s, prompting the formation of several new companies. Among these companies were Intralytix and Exponential Biotherapies; both initially targeted Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
Georgia.
The Georgian experience with phage therapy centers around what is now the Eliava Institute in Tbilisi, which was founded in the 1930s by George Eliava, in association with Félix d'Hérelle. The pattern followed was one of receiving strains of pathogenic bacteria from throughout the Soviet Union, against which phages were isolated, tested and adapted. Testing included checking for virulence against target bacteria, along with host range, using appropriate panels of what currently were the most problematic strains of the bacteria in question. The result ultimately was a large operation employing 1,200 people, most of whom were involved in phage production, with a production capacity of approximately 2 tons per week. The bulk of their output was shipped to the Soviet military—for treatment of diarrhea and wounds, predominantly—while the rest was available in various forms to the general public. Georgia declared independence from the states of the Soviet Union just before the latter's collapse in 1991. The Georgian military employed phage formulations, with soldiers in 1991 and 1992 carrying canisters of phages during battles in the disputed territory of Abkhazia, and developed special formulations for the key battlefield strains. Phage treatment was again used extensively during the battles following the 2008 dispute in the region between Georgia and Russia (Gvasalia G, personal communication).
“Intestiphage” is among the phage products that are directly available to the public without prescription in Georgia and Russia. This cocktail targets about 20 different pathogenic gastrointestinal bacteria. A second cocktail, “Pyophage”, containing phages targeting Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Proteus and E. coli is routinely employed in the treatment of various purulent skin or wound infections. We place quotes around the names of the Georgian phage products upon first mention, such as “Intestiphage” and “Pyophage,” because Georgia employs a different alphabet, with transliterations therefore varying in spelling, where and correspond to the names of these products, respectively. These are actually generic product names, as additional versions are produced by a second Georgian company, Biochimpharm, and in several cities in Russia, such as Ufa and Perm, where factories also flourished in Soviet times. These preparations are not static phage mixtures but are continuously updated in response to changes in pathogen targets. Indeed, they represent formulations that were originally derived from phage products developed by d'Hérelle. Thus, they are not identical through time, or from place to place across the former Soviet Union.11 In Tbilisi, they are updated every 6 months by addition of phages particularly targeting newly emerging problem strains. Each batch is tested by the manufacturer and then by their Medication Certification Lab against batteries of each of the target strains; they are required to hit a certain specified fraction of the strains for each type before state approval is received for them to be marketed.
The major medical school in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, now also hosts a Surgical Infections and Phage Therapy program, which is aimed particularly towards thoroughly training a few Georgian surgeons per year in the management of severe surgical and wound infections using phages as key therapeutic elements. Pyophage is the primary phage formulation employed. This cocktail has also been incorporated into biodegradable products such as PhagoBioDerm,3,11,83,101 a polymeric bandage into which the phages along with other active ingredients are added during manufacture so that phages can be released slowly and continuously over a period of time after application. PhagoBioDerm can be applied to wounds or infections as sheets; it can also be cut into small pieces or ground into powder and placed directly into wounds. In all cases, a basic component of phage treatment of wounds and infections is thorough wound cleaning as well as mechanical removal of infected and dead tissues (debridement) so that the wound can heal properly and phages can easily reach actively replicating bacteria.
For quite detailed discussions of the Georgian phage therapy experience, see in reference 3, 10 and 11. Also, in their 2009 English-language review of the older Georgian phage therapy literature7 (some of which is in Georgian, some in Russian), Chanishvili and Sharp extensively discuss phage treatment of a range of human diseases. This material is variously cited in the below sections on specific applications and provides an invaluable overview of otherwise hard-to-obtain, non-English language phage therapy studies. Though not generally double-blinded, many of the studies reviewed by Chanishvili and Sharp7 nonetheless employ negative-treatment controls. This resource also provides extensive insight into the practice and understanding of phage therapy as a regular part of medical practice. The book can be purchased directly from the Eliava Institute, with contact information available through eliava-institute.org.
Despite a long and apparently successful history of phage therapy in Georgia and other parts of the Soviet Union, there has been little primary publication in English-language journals. This was in part due to the intense secrecy behind the Iron Curtain surrounding militarily applicable sciences. Additionally, as phages were often used to deal with otherwise-intractable medical problems and represented the standard of care long before development of double-blinded clinical trials, little of this western “Gold standard” of medical documentation has been performed. So far, there has been little transfer of phages or phage therapy expertise, or indeed enthusiasm for phages to western medical practice. One counter-example is the successful treatment of many Lubbock Wound Center patients with Pyophage from Georgia that led Randy Wolcott to conduct his FDA-approved phase I trial of phage against leg ulcers.102 The trial itself used 8 fully sequenced phages prepared for him by Intralytix: 2 targeting S. aureus, 5 for P. aeruginosa, and 1 for E. coli.
Russia.
The story of Russia's role in the development of phage therapy is long, inaccessible to the non-Russian speaker, and has not been subject to the same kind of scrutiny as has the Georgian experience. Due to limitations in both space and access to resources, we only briefly outline the Russian story here and include a table (Table 1) of important papers from the former Soviet Union (FSU). Sulakvelidze and Kutter3 and Häusler28 provide substantially more detail of the older Soviet-era work. A review by Letarov et al. on rational phage therapy103 gives insight into some of the more recent thought and work. See also various English-language reviews by Viktor Krylov.104,105

Focus in the USSR was on treatment of diarrheal infections, with anti-dysentery treatment a top priority; infections associated with battle and trauma, particularly targeting gas gangrene; and also infections of infants and small children. Phages were applied as liquids, tablets, creams, in association with tampons as well as enemas, as aerosols, parenterally via injection, etc., and the technology for making stable, effective tablet forms of phage was first developed there. Phage formulations were produced in large quantities at, for example, the Alma-Ata branch of the Central Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology and so too were phages produced in Moscow, Stalingrad, Sverdlovsk, Tashkent, etc. Research institutes included the Gorsky Research Institute of Epidemiology and Mirobiology. As in Georgia, in addition to language barriers, phage research funded by the military was deemed to be a state secret, thereby hindering publication. An additional issue that interfered with wide consideration of this work stemmed similarly from phages representing a standard of care, resulting in a tendency in many (but not all) publications to not compare phage treatments with phage-less controls but instead, for example, to compare the efficacy of one phage formulation with each other. A major Soviet pharmacological giant, Microgen, has now taken over all of the commercial phage production in Russia, and a wide variety of their phage preparations are available in pharmacies as well as on line,3,103 and, reportedly, are used extensively in many parts of Russia. However, they seem to have published little in terms of phage characterization or clinical trials.

Phages as Antibacterial “Drugs”
Before discussing additional documentation of phage therapy of human patients—as has been used in the treatment of specific categories of infection—we first explore basic principles of phage use as antibacterial “medicinals”. In this section in particular we consider issues of phage isolation, purification and choice for therapy; phage therapy pharmacokinetics; phage safety; and phage use as probiotics. Note that the safety of phage therapy can be described as a secondary pharmacodynamic issue. Efficacy, which for phage therapy can be measured in terms of whether or not bacteria are reduced in numbers or improvement occurs in other clinical signs and symptoms, is the primary issue of pharmacodynamics, which we return to in the above-noted last section of this review.
Phage isolation, choice and purification.
The first steps of all phage therapy protocols involve some combination of phage isolation and phage choice.106,107 As practiced, phage therapy typically relies on one of two models of phage choice. The first involves cocktails of multiple phages that display a wider spectrum of activity than their individual phage components, such as Intestiphage and Pyophage, which allows for use against a wider array of bacterial targets and virtually eliminates any resistance developing in the short term. The first modern, commercially available therapeutic phage preparations in the West will probably be based on this approach. In the second approach, pathogenic bacteria are isolated from infections and tested against a large, generally well-characterized collection of previously isolated phages. Some studies from Russia, e.g., Zhukov-Verezhnikov et al.98 showed that the resulting custom-designed phage preparations often worked better than mainstream-production phage preparations. This is also the approach generally used in Poland.
The procedures by which phages are isolated are similar regardless of the phage-choice model used and generally involve some form of phage enrichment. Though enrichment tends to preclude an even sampling of a phage-containing community, this serves two basic useful functions with regard to phage therapy. The first is that enrichment tends to bias isolation towards those phages that display greater antibacterial virulence, at least in the sense of being able to propagate at the expense of target bacteria under the specific environmental conditions within which enrichment takes place. The second is that phage isolation is biased towards those phages that are readily propagated in the laboratory, which is a very helpful property when it comes to amplifying phages to prepare stocks for application to patients.
Some degree of purification is generally required following laboratory amplification.106 The simplest of phage purification protocols involve clarification of lysed cultures via either centrifugation or filtration. Phage precipitation, employing polyethylene glycol or, for the larger phages, high-speed centrifugation, also can be employed. These approaches largely remove remaining uninfected cells, post-lysis bacterial ghosts and some other bacterial lysis products. More stringent purification—generally used for more invasive applications of phages—involves either ultracentrifugation, a series of filtration and washing/buffer-exchange steps, or various forms of chromatography.
Phage therapy pharmacokinetics.
The pharmacology of phage therapy has been subjected to a handful of reviews that emphasize various aspects of the subject61,108–110 along with a few additional articles that touch upon it.111–113 Pharmacology, as generally defined, is the study of a drug's impact on the body as well as the body's impact on drugs. These two perspectives are differentiated, respectively, into what are known as pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Note that the concept of body, when considering antimicrobials as drugs, includes both normal body tissues and the numerous symbiotic microorganisms. In this section we focus on considerations of pharmacokinetic aspects of phage therapy pharmacology.
Pharmacokinetics is a description of a drug's potential to reach densities in the vicinity of target tissues that are sufficient to achieve primary pharmacodynamic effects. This description typically is distinguished into absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion components. Absorption is drug movement into the blood, distribution is drug movement into other body tissues, metabolism is the modification of drugs within the body, and excretion is the movement of drugs out of the body. All four of these pharmacokinetic aspects have the effect of both reducing and increasing drug densities. Both absorption and distribution, for example, result in declines in drug densities due to drug dilution, which at the same time increases drug density in specific body compartments. For phages, metabolism can represent phage inactivation, as due to phage interaction with immune systems, or “activation”, such as phage in situ replication. Lastly, while excretion can certainly play a role in the reduction of drug densities in the body, so too it can also serve as a route towards increased drug densities in places such as the bladder, with therapeutic benefits.6,114
In any case, phage therapy success depends on the generation of sufficient phage densities in the vicinity of the target bacteria to cause bacterial clearance from the body at some adequate rate or to some adequate degree. Phages will increase to sufficient densities due either to in situ replication, so-called active treatment, or as a consequence of what can be described as pharmacologically conventional dosing, so-called passive treatment. These means of increasing phage density must be sufficiently robust that they are able to counter mechanisms of phage loss. The goal, pharmacokinetically, is thus to attain and then sustain in the vicinity of target bacteria whatever minimum phage densities are necessary to achieve desired levels of bacterial eradication.
Safety of phage therapy.
Secondary pharmacodynamics are descriptions of a drug's toxicity as well as its degree of impact on non-target tissues. In this section we briefly discuss the issues of phage impact on body tissues (as opposed to impact on normal microbiota), the potential for phage particles to stimulate immunological reactions, phage impact on non-target microbiota, and the ability of phages to modify bacterial targets, all as can result in side effects. Notwithstanding our presentation strategy, emphasizing what can go wrong, in fact phage therapy as currently practiced rarely if ever results in more than minor side effects. As phage applications broaden and escalate, care in phage selection and therapeutic implementation may well be important in assuring a continuation of this enviable track record. A number of reviews address issues of phage therapy safety in some detail.3,22,105,115,116
Non-antimicrobial chemical drugs are generally intended to interact with and modify body tissues in some manner over the shorter or longer term. Drugs that interact with multiple tissues, however, run the risk of interacting with non-target tissues, which can result in changes that would not be considered clinically favorable. Phages clearly interact with non-target tissue to some extent. For example, at least some phages are taken up from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood61 and there is reason to believe that such uptake can be a consequence of specific phage-to-epithelium interactions,117 as also appears to be the case given phage interaction with the reticulo-endothelial system.118 These interactions with body tissues, however, do not appear to result in side effects.
The immunology of phages has been a subject of study for well over a half a century, both in terms of the generation of humoral immune responses and the potential of immune responses beyond just humoral immunity to result in the inactivation of phage virion particles.3 In the course of these studies, no phage potential to initiate substantial anaphylaxis has been reported. Indeed, a group led by Górski have provided evidence of a positive impact of phages on immune system functioning6 and have explored potential phage anti-tumor properties mediated through observed shifts in levels of various cytokines as a consequence of interactions between extra decorative head proteins with surface proteins of certain immune-system cells.119 Note that this does not involve nor imply an ability of phages to infect mammalian cells.
Part of the apparent mildness of phage particles in their interaction with human tissue is that animals have been exposed to large numbers of phage virions presumably over the entire course of animal evolution, perhaps resulting in greater levels of tolerance than one observes with the application of novel—to us—chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, activation of substantial immune response to, for example, bacteria or foreign cells generally involves extremely large numbers of copies of the same cell-surface component. Getting high-level production of phage antibodies from rabbits and other animals, however, involves the use of strong adjuvants and carefully-controlled, wide-spaced timing of multiple injections (Gachechiladze L, personal communication). It should be noted, though, that Ochs and colleagues (in ref. 120) have repeatedly shown production of antibodies to IV-administered phage φX174 without adjuvants, including in patients with a variety of immunodeficiencies.
An important aspect of many chemical antibacterials is their breadth of action. This is a positive aspect because it can allow antibiotic application prior to determination of the antibiotic susceptibility of a pathogen. This property, however, is a double-edged sword, since non-target as well as target bacteria are impacted by such broad-spectrum antibiotics. The result can be dysbiosis, that is, a negative impact on important normal bacterial flora. One result of antibiotic usage consequently can be antibiotic-associated superinfections, such as vaginal yeast infections or Clostridium difficile-associated colitis. Most phages, by contrast, possess only narrow spectra of activity: Even when phages are mixed into cocktails, their overall activity spectrum remains relatively narrow. The result is a lower potential for side effects associated with dysbiosis, a phenomenon that does not appear to be a concern associated with phage therapy.
The one potentially serious concern that has been expressed of phage therapy safety is the ability of at least some phages to modify host bacteria in ways that could make them more pathogenic. In particular, it is generally important to avoid using temperate phages for phage therapy purposes. A temperate phage is able to display a property known as lysogeny, where phages incorporate their genomes into the bacteria they are infecting rather than immediately killing the host and producing phage progeny. Once there, a long-term relationship ensues where the phage exists as a component of the bacterium, forming a lysogen. The problem with lysogens is at least four-fold. First, bacteria that are lysogenically rather than lytically infected do not die as a consequence of infection. Second, bacterial lysogens tend to be resistant to the phage types that have lysogenically infected them, resulting in no bacterial killing even if subsequent phages of the same type succeed in infecting. Third, temperate phages often display lysogenic conversion, meaning that they modify the bacterial phenotype, sometimes in ways that result in increased bacterial virulence.121–123 Lastly, temperate phages are associated with certain forms of transduction, meaning that they can fairly readily pick up new genes from the bacteria they are infecting and then transfer those genes to subsequently infected bacteria—without killing those new bacteria. For each of these reasons one should avoid temperate phages as therapeutic agents, if that is possible.
Non-temperate phages can also display transduction and perhaps could also carry bacterial virulence factor genes, either constitutively or inadvertently. However, those phages either kill the new host if they carry only a few non-phage genes, avoiding longer term problems, or if they carry either primarily or only bacterial genes then at least the phage cannot propagate further. These concerns can be mitigated in the course of phage characterization, both genomic and phenotypic. However, a substantial amount of phage therapy has been conducted on humans as well as animals, and to date there does not appear to be evidence that these factors are concerns in the course of phage therapy where non-temperate, “obligatorily lytic” phages are used. These mostly theoretical concerns can be further addressed by analyzing genomes of all phages that are considered for inclusion in therapeutic phage cocktails, to ensure that they do not carry any toxin-encoding or other undesirable genes (for example those specified by the FDA in 40 CFR §725.421).
Also related to the phage potential to enhance the toxicity or virulence associated with bacteria is phage-mediated bacterial lysis, resulting in the release of bacteria-encoded toxins. In the case of endotoxin, this release can be substantially greater than in the absence of such lysis,124,125 though keep in mind that many antibiotics also possess this property of lysing target bacteria. In the case of exotoxins it is an open question whether phage application will result in any more than an acceleration of toxin release, particularly to the extent that phage infection results in a shut down in bacterial gene expression and thereby a cessation at least of the transcription of bacterial exotoxin genes.
The release of endotoxin places limits on the phage treatment of gram-negative systemic infections,22 just as phages employed systemically also require additional purification steps to avoid carrying over endotoxin generated during phage production. Slopek et al.65 for example, though otherwise observing few side effects, did report that some patients experienced several hours of pain in the liver area 3 to 5 days into treatments. This, as the authors suggest, might conceivably reflect phage-mediated liberation of endotoxins and other bacterial pathogenicity factors in the course of bacterial lysis (see also ref. 22), though also it could have been treatment-unrelated symptoms of the ongoing illness in the patients. In other patients some fever was observed approximately one week into treatments. Lysates from Gram-positive organisms when injected also can lead to “side effects ranging from mild to severe”, as discussed by Sulakvelidze and Kutter3 (and more generally may explain the “violent reactions” following phage injection described by Mikeladze53 and as discussed above). These issues are less of a concern when treating bacterial infections locally. It is also possible to modify phages to prevent lysis so that toxin release is less of a concern,107 but that obviates one of the basic advantages of phage therapy—the ability to move throughout the organism and multiply where needed.107
Phages as probiotics.
One concept of probiotic intervention that has received very little attention in the past is the use of phages to specifically target “problem” bacterial species in the GI tract. Although not typically thought of as probiotics, bacteriophages actually fit well the definition by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organization (WHO) of probiotics: “live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host”.126 Because of the specificity of bacteriophages, bacteriophage-based “probiotic products” may provide a novel, safe and effective approach for favorably manipulating the GI tract's microflora. In particular, (1) phages may reduce or eliminate their targeted pathogenic bacteria in the gut, with no deleterious effects on the beneficial microflora and (2) regular consumption of phage-based probiotics (alone, or in combination with bacteria-based probiotics and prebiotics) may gently and favorably alter the GI tract's microflora and thereby provide added protection against the specifically-targeted diarrhea-producing bacterial pathogens.
Phage-based probiotics would be used prophylactically rather than therapeutically, although it is clear that prophylactically supplied phages also could act therapeutically if administered early in bacterial infections. While probiotic bacterial formulations introduce nonpathogenic bacteria to interfere with the ability of pathogenic bacteria to colonize the GI tract, phage-based probiotics aid the GI-tract balance by targeting specific pathogenic bacteria. They are likely to be most successful for managing pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Clostridium difficile, diarrheagenic E. coli and other bacteria that have an oral portal of entry and require short- or long-term colonization of the GI tract in order to cause disease. At least one recently-published paper suggests that the approach has merit,127 while additional research is currently underway (Sulakvelidze A, personal communication). Because of their high specificity, phages are likely to be unique tools for manipulating the microflora composition of the GI tract in a much more specific way than has been possible with other probiotic organisms or other antibacterial agents. Hence, a phage-based approach is likely to open new and exciting avenues for subsequent research in many areas related to basic and applied probiotic research, the GI tract's microflora and nutrition.

Phage Approaches to Treatment of Specific Diseases
In a world in which antibiotics represent the standard first-line therapy against bacterial infections, the envisaged use of phages tends to focus on three main indications: to combat infections involving antibiotic-resistant bacteria, to combat infections that are antibiotic resistant despite the sensitivity in culture of their etiologies (e.g., as due the poor circulation of osteomyelitis and diabetic ulcers or to biofilm formation), and to target bacteria under circumstances where antibiotics are counter-indicated due, for example, to patient allergies, irritable bowel problems or fear of Clostridium difficile, as well as in food and agricultural applications due to concerns with excess human and environmental exposure to antibiotics. Though we might imagine that phage studies therefore would tend to involve direct comparisons between phage and antibiotic application, the bulk of the literature documenting phage treatment of humans involves case studies rather than blinded experiments and is therefore subject to experimenter's bias. Though treatments typically are of infections that have resisted antibiotics—sometimes over many years—one must still ask whether something other than the phages employed might in fact be responsible for these documented patient recoveries or whether the infections might have spontaneously resolved during therapy due to factors independent of the phage treatment process. These are questions to keep in mind as we explore the published phage therapy literature, with a focus on work from the antibiotic era, particularly that has taken place since the molecular nature of bacteriophages became well understood,128,129 the tools of molecular biology have become available as applied to phages,130 and phages have been better appreciated as ecological131 as well as pharmacological109 entities.
Skin ulcers.
We begin with skin ulcers because their treatment has recently been subject to active experimentation within the US. In addition, the treatment of skin ulcers can be used as a good example of the benefits as well as concerns associated with phage therapy, with concerns tending to be associated predominantly with how procedure efficacy is determined (previous paragraph). Overall, the employment of phages to treat infected skin ulcerations within the context of western medical practice would appear to be quite promising. Infected skin ulcerations can be chronic and resistant to antibiotic treatment. Phages can be topically applied with impressive success, though rarely if ever within the context of rigorous, double-blinded and peer-reviewed studies.
Markoishvili et al. report on the use of PhagoBioDerm, the phage impregnated polymer, to treat infected venous stasis skin ulcers. To patients that had failed to respond to other treatment approaches, PhagoBioDerm was applied to ulcers both alone and, where appropriate, in combination with other treatment strategies. Complete healing of ulcers was observed in 70% of nearly 100 patients. Slopek et al.64 report 75% positive results for phage treatment of 36 cases of “Varicose veins with ulcer and inflammation” and 95.0% positive cases (our calculation) for phage treatment of 162 “Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue”, which includes furunculosis, “inflammation of the connective tissue and lymphatic vessels” and decubitus ulcer.
In the Chanishvili and Sharp7 book, the chapter on “Phage therapy in dermatology” reports on the successful treatment of deep forms of dermatitis, such as furunculosis, abscesses and hidradenitis, as described in several articles. Treatment of acute furunculosis and hidradenitis was highly successful and treatment of chronic furunculosis was successful in the majority of cases. After disinfecting the lesion and surrounding area, pus was drained and cultured, tested for phage sensitivity, and phages were injected with an initial dose of 0.5 mL into the lesion and surrounding areas, and with increasing daily doses depending on the response. Vartepetov (1957), as cited, noted that a total of 6,000 patients had been studied: healing occurred within 4–8 days, and 70–100% of patients were cured. New lesions were healed with a reduction in scarring. Pain typically disappeared after 1–2 injections. Intradermal injections were more efficient than subcutaneous injections. A series of intradermal injections was typically given every other day at increasing doses (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mL, repeated for a total of 7–10 injections). A later article by Shvelidze in 1970 reported the treatment of staphylococcal boils, furuncles, carbuncles and hidradenitis in patients who had failed antibiotic treatment and noted 94.4% successfully treated, 4.3% with significant improvement and 1.3% with no improvement.
A successful physician-initiated FDA-approved phase I safety trial of phage therapy against skin ulcerations and other wounds was completed in 2008 at the Wound Care Center in Lubbock, Texas, following a series of positive results with Pyophage brought from the Eliava Institute over a period of several years under “compassionate use” provisions. For the phase I trial102 a special formulation of fully sequenced phages prepared by the company Intralytix, containing only two phages active against S. aureus, five against P. aeruginosa and one against E. coli, was applied to chronic infections without observation of significant side effects. Phage phase I safety trials have also been administered by the companies Exponential Biotherapies11 and Biocontrol, though only the latter is published.132 See also in reference 133 for an additional phage safety trial and reference 11 for review and discussion of these trials.
Cislo et al.134 review the treatment of 31 patients displaying suppurative (a.k.a., purulent) chronic infections of the skin; this work is of particular interest due to photographic documentation. They reported “outstanding”, “marked” and “transitory” improvement in 16, 7 and 2 cases, respectively; phages were delivered both locally and per os. These positive results were observed between 2 and 16 weeks after the initiation of treatment and followed all of the bacteria isolated from the infections, implementing replacement of phages when resistance to the initially-used phages was noted. No antibiotic co-treatment was performed but patients with leg ulcers were given drugs that resulted in dilation of peripheral blood vessels. Side effects included intensification of pain (2 cases) and eczema near the point (4 cases). Oral application was associated with nausea in about 10% of the cases and vomiting in one.
Purulent infections.
Purulent infections are those from which exudate, that is, pus, is actively released. An early example of such treatment (1927) took place in Poland as conducted by Jaseinski, reportedly with particular success against furuncles as well as other purulent wounds and few side effects.10,135 In Georgia, the pyophage formulation is routinely employed to treat purulent infections with high rates of success even given severe infection.10
Generally, treatment of infections close to the surface of the body involves a number of steps. The first is cleaning the wound quite radically, including removal of necrotic tissue (debridement), which is crucial in an ongoing fashion with all wounds. Often, the typical procedure of incision and drainage is done, so that the wound is open and still-living tissue is highly accessible. The next step is to assure adequate drainage of exudate from the wound. As usual, premature closure of the wound before the infection is adequately treated such that the wound has been rendered sterile can lead to many complications. Georgian surgeons find that use of a Pyophage cocktail—including as infusions and in the form of PhagoBioDerm, etc.—during early wound treatment facilitates far earlier wound closure and faster healing.
Weber-Dabrowska et al.135 indicate that phage therapy has been effective in the treatment of purulent cerebro-spinal meningitis, otitis media and postoperative infections.65 Slopek et al.64 reported 100% positive results for phage treatment of 7 cases of “Purulent pericarditis” and high success rates for a variety of other infections described as suppurative. Similarly, Slopek et al.68 reported 92.4% positive results in the treatment of 370 cases of suppurative infection of which 241 cases did not involve parallel antibiotic therapy (96.2% positive results). In 18 cases, phages were used in patients who had not been previously treated with antibiotics. As a novel twist, phages in this study to some degree were “propagated on the strains isolated from patients”. Six additional papers by Slopek et al. consider “Results of bacteriophage treatment of suppurative bacterial infections”65–70 and generally indicate high rates of positive results.
Staphylococcus aureus: methicillin-resistant (MRSA).
MRSA is a particular concern given its inherently reduced susceptibility to antibiotic treatment, wide prevalence in hospital-acquired infections and in the community, and potentially lethal and otherwise serious consequences. These pathogens are targeted by the anti-S. aureus activity of phage preparations such as Pyophage (which include potent anti-Staphylococcus phages of the broadspectrum Sb1-staph phage K family; Kutter EM, unpublished results). Here as elsewhere, there is no cross-resistance between phages and antibiotics. Furthermore, very little development of resistance to this family of phages is observed, presumably implying that their still-unidentified primary receptor is a molecule of significant importance to the cell. Thus, so far as phages are concerned, MRSA is simply another strain of Staphylococcus.
Treatment of MRSA using phages can be accomplished by local application for local infections or, if necessary, and with substantially more caution, more systemic dosing such as intraperitoneally for systemic infections.76 The use of phage treatment for local infections, including particularly those due to Staphylococcus, has the distinction of being one of only two phage therapy strategies that were deemed to be convincingly efficacious by the 1934 Eaton and Bayne-Jones report,14–16 an otherwise phage-therapy skeptical publication; see also reference 77. Indeed, the first human phage therapy publication reported on treatment of S. aureus skin infections.3,22,44 Phage preparations for systemic application were developed at the Eliava Institute during the 1980s, including safety studies in human volunteers without adverse effect. They were particularly effective in infants, in immune-compromised patients and for infusion into the urethra in cases of pelvic inflammatory disease. The preparation subsequently was used to treat 653 patients.3
Historically, questions have been raised as to whether the efficacy documented in these classic articles was due to the phage itself giving rise to bacterial lysis in situ. It has been suggested that the debris in the phage lysate, stimulating the host immune system, could be a major factor in bacterial clearance.3,62 See, for reference 4 and 11 for discussion of what is known variously as Lincoln Bacteriophage Lysate, Staphylococcus Phage Lysate or simply SPL, produced by Delmont laboratories. This product is marketed as a veterinary vaccine conferring resistance to staph through immune stimulation by its staphylococcal-phage induced bacterial lysis products, which is advertised as the major active ingredient. It does also contain viable phages, often at ∼108 PFU/mL (Kutter EM, unpublished data; Kuhl SJ, unpublished data), a level as high as the total phage in Pyophage as determined by direct fluorescent microscopic count (Brown N, personal communication). These staph phage lysates initially were produced for human as well as animal use against chronic infections.3 However, in 1994 they were limited by the FDA to animal use pending further human efficacy trials, for which no funding has yet been found; no questions have been raised as to their safety.
Phage use to prevent Staphylococcus infections has been both proposed and employed. Use of phages for disinfection has been carried out in Georgia to sanitize operating rooms and medical equipment and prevent nosocomial infections.22 A complementary approach proposed by the company Novoltyics is to use “a gel containing a cocktail of phages targeted at MRSA to treat nasal carriage of MRSA, thus significantly reducing the incidence of MRSA transmission” (see www.novolytics.co.uk/technology.html; see also ref. 136). O'Flaherty et al. describe removal of S. aureus via experimental hand washing with a phage-containing Ringers solution. Approximately 100-fold reductions in bacterial densities were observed after washing with a solution containing 108 phages/mL versus the phage-less control solution.
Leszczynski et al. describe the use of oral phage therapy for targeting MRSA in a nurse who was a carrier. This individual was MRSA colonized in her gastrointestinal tract and also had a urinary tract infection. The result of phage therapy was complete elimination of culturable MRSA. In an earlier publication the same group argued that MRSA treatment using phages can be economically preferable to MRSA treatment using antibiotics;139 by contrast, though, see in reference 140. Jikia et al. describe phage treatment of MRSA infecting radiation burns (below).
Slopek et al.64 report 92.4% positive cases for phage treatment of 550 single- and mixed-etiology infections involving Staphylococcus aureus. Slopek et al.70 addresses specifically phage treatment of suppurative staphylococcal infections, with a reported 93% “effective” rate “based on case history and data contained in a special questionnaire” (p. 262), while Slopek et al.69 consider the treatment of Staphylococcus infection of children (95.5% positive results, our calculation, of 90 children treated).
Wound prophylaxis.
Wounds can be due to surgery, accident or burns. The term wound does not imply infection, and of course one object in wound care is to avoid infection. Thus phages can be used for prophylaxis to prevent infection, including for the prophylaxis of surgical site infections. Phage treatment is particularly indicated in Georgia under circumstances where wounds are large in area and where therapeutically effective concentrations of systemically administered antibiotics are not easily attained.11 In this section we concentrate specifically on such wounds and on the prevention of infection, drawing especially on the “Phage therapy in surgery and wound treatment” chapter in the Chanishvili and Sharp7 book and the detailed discussion of the current Georgian situation by Kutter et al.9 Phages can be supplied in the course of wound irrigation, can be soaked into bandages, and/or can be provided in a time-release manner (as discussed above in terms of PhageBioderm). Resulting phage densities are a product of the numbers provided and those generated in the course of in situ phage replication.
Wounds can become infected with a variety of pathogens, including those that can give rise to gangrene. The Russian army during World War II successfully treated wounds using phages. In one study, for example, of those receiving anti-Clostridium phages following battlefield wounds, ∼80% survived versus only ∼60% survival among those not receiving phage treatment.10 In another study, prophylactic treatment saw three-fold greater gangrene incidence among non-phage-treated soldiers versus those who were phage treated.141 Pyophage spraying of wounds has been employed by Georgian soldiers on the battlefield, reducing infection, prolonging the time over which treatment is optimally performed, and increasing rates of recovery.11 Slopek et al.64 report 90.8% positive cases for phage treatment of 305 “injuries”.
Burns.
An ongoing major concern in burn wounds is infection, which also often deters skin grafting. In a promising animal model, Soothill142 showed that phage application to wounds prior to grafting could block challenges with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. This is an impressive result given that successful grafting requires not just prevention of bacterial growth but also tissue healing. More generally, phages have not been found to interfere with wound healing and, as some propose, may even contribute positively to healing.
Jikia et al. describe the use of phages to treat radiation burns suffered by three Georgian lumberjacks. These individuals had the misfortune of encountering Soviet radiothermal generators in the woods (90Sr), which they used to warm themselves during the night. The burns subsequently became infected with MRSA. Following unsuccessful antibiotic treatment, phage therapy was attempted using PhagoBioDerm preparations in sheet form. Due to the large size of the resulting ulcerations, multiple PhagoBioDerm sheets were applied to fully cover the burn area. Purulent drainage, which had not been impacted by antibiotic treatment, decreased “to almost none” after two days of PhagoBioDerm treatment. Testing failed to detect MRSA on day seven. As no phage-less controls were employed, this study does not constitute proof of phage-mediated efficacy. Nonetheless it is strongly indicative that further study is warranted. Lazareva et al. similarly have reported positive results of phage treatment of infected burns.
Abdul-Hassan et al. reported on the treatment of 30 cases of burn-wound associated antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa sepsis. Bandages soaked with 1010 phages/mL were applied three times daily. Half of the cases they describe as “improved” (such as in terms of granulation criteria). In 18 of 30 cases there was good (12) or excellent (6) skin graft take. Discharge was eliminated in 12 cases and diminished in another 12. Furthermore, in 8 of the 30 cases, infection was eliminated (“sterile cultures”).
These results are fairly typical of modern, documented phage therapy applications such as those presented in the Slopek et al. studies, that is, achievement of sterility and/or complete healing in a moderate fraction of cases, substantially positive clinical results in a much greater fraction and at least some improvement in many or most. Following this precedent, Marza et al. applied filter disks to which phages were applied to the P. aeruginosa infected burns of a 27-year-old male. After 48 hours the phages were shown to increase their presence in the disks by three orders of magnitude. Phages were then applied more generally but no reports of microbiological impact are provided and whether phages contributed to subsequent patient healing is inconclusive.
Recently, a group of Belgian surgeons and scientists have developed an extensive collaboration with phage biologists in both Moscow and Tbilisi to explore the possibilities of using phages in burn applications. In preparation, they carried out a year-long study of P. aeruginosa colonization and infection during which a total of 441 patients were treated at the 32-bed Burn Wound Centre of the Queen Astrid Military Hospital in Brussels. Of these, 70 were colonized with P. aeruginosa, 57 of whom acquired the organism during their stay. Eight patients infected with P. aeruginosa died. For three of them, no other bacteria were detected and death was directly attributed to the P. aeruginosa infection. They have now carried out a small phase I study involving nine patients, approved by a medical ethics committee, in which a section of a large burn on each patient was exposed to a single spray application. A distant portion of the same wound was used as a control, with no phage included in the treatment applied there. Both regions were monitored with tissue biopsies before application and between two and five hours after treatment application by bacterial quantitative culture. The patients were carefully monitored for a period of 3 weeks after the treatment. No adverse events, clinical abnormalities, or changes in laboratory test results that could be related to the application of phages were observed.
Merabishvili et al.144 describe in extensive detail the quality-controlled production of the BFC-1 phage cocktail used for the above Belgian human clinical trials. This cocktail consists of three phages, a Myovirus and a Podovirus against P. aeruginosa and a Myovirus against S. aureus. These obligately lytic phages were selected from a pool of 82 P. aeruginosa and eight S. aureus phages using a batch of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus strains that are representative of the most prevalent isolates in the BWC of the QAMH. The cocktail was purified of endotoxin. The elaborate quality control included stability (shelf life), determination of pyrogenicity, sterility and cytotoxicity, confirmation of the absence of temperate phages, and transmission electron microscopy-based confirmation of the presence of the expected virion morphologic particles as well as of their specific interaction with the target bacteria. Phage genome and proteome analysis were consistent with the conclusions that the chosen phages were not temperate and that there was an absence of toxin-coding genes. Their efforts are discussed also by Kutter et al.11
Poorly accessible infections.
A number of infections for various reasons are not highly susceptible to either systemically administered or topically applied antibiotics. With systemic circulation the problems can be two fold, with either poor penetration to peripheral tissues starting from general circulation (which is distribution in pharmacokinetic terms) or a requirement for higher plasma antibiotic densities than can be safely realized (which is a secondary pharmacodynamic concern). The concerns with topical application are similar but with a slightly different emphasis, one of limitations to diffusion—from the point of application to sufficiently deeply into infections—and again possible toxicity given antibiotic application in sufficient amounts that indeed satisfactory densities are attained in the vicinity of target bacteria. Antibiotics also may be diluted or indeed inactivated within the complex conditions found directly within infections,11 or can be ineffective even given reasonable penetration such as into bacterial biofilms.145 Examples of such situations where antibiotics typically display poor or inadequate penetration properties to target infections include osteomyelitis, diabetic infections of the feet, burns and infections of the central nervous system, which can be protected from antibiotics due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (but which does not necessarily prevent adequate phage penetration to combat infections as shown by Dubos et al.—see Fig. 1). These are all circumstances in which phage therapy may be more efficacious than antibiotic chemotherapy despite infection with fully antibiotic-susceptible bacteria.
By way of example of the phage potential for treating poorly accessible infections, Lang et al.48 reported treating five out of seven orthopedic cases successfully and one case partially successfully, out of a total of seven. Slopek et al.64 report 89.5% positive cases for phage treatment of 19 “Pyogenic [arthritis] and myositis” and 90% positive cases for phage treatment of 40 “Pyogenic ostitis”. Furthermore, in Georgia, chronic osteomyelitis serves as a primary indication for phage treatment; in most cases this requires debridement of necrotic tissue along with the phage treatment, but is much faster and more likely to be effective than treatments not involving phage. Slopek et al.64 also report 90% positive cases for phage treatment of 10 cases of “Meningitis”. For additional discussion of phage use against infections to which antibiotics can display poor penetration, see Kutter et al.11
Eye infections.
In summarizing the literature available to them on phage treatment of eye infections, Górski et al.146 write (p. 164):
Current experience with phage applications in [ophthalmology], judging from available literature, is very limited and involves some 28 patients treated with antistaphylococcal phages for conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Proskurov147 applied phages as eye drops (2 drops 3 times daily) in conjunctivitis, while in blepharitis this was supplemented with topical application of a phage suspension onto the eyelids. The authors claimed good effects in all 17 patients, although no details were provided.147 In 7 cases of conjunctivitis, 1 of dacryocystitis and 3 of hordeolum described by a group from our institute, eye drops and moist applications caused full recovery.64 No side effects were reported by either group.
The book reviewing the Eliava experience also details the experience with phage therapy in ophthalmology.7 Dautova and colleagues used “Pio” bacteriophage to successfully treat 30 patients with traumatic bacterial keratitis and 16 patients with purulent corneal ulcers. Equal numbers of patients in control groups were treated with gentamicin eye drops. The patients treated with bacteriophage showed a more rapid improvement in inflammation, pain and eye watering, and were discharged on average at 11 days instead of 15. The successful treatment of 32 children with acute bacterial conjunctivitis was also described by Kilasonia and Karanadze (2001), as cited. The bacteria were antibiotic resistant and the patients were allergic to antibiotics, making antibiotic treatment impossible. All cases improved by the third day and were cured by the seventh day; there were no relapses during the next month of observation.
Gastrointestinal ailments.
D'Hérelle discovered bacteriophages in association with the examination of dysentery in humans148 and quickly developed an interest in the purposeful treatment of dysentery using phages.22,29 Experimental antidysentery trials also were extensively conducted over multiple decades in eastern Europe and Georgia, though often with insufficient publication of documentation.10,32 Much of what we know of them relies on abstracts presented at meetings held around the former Soviet Union—particularly at the Eliava Institute—as well as dissertations. One of the principle advantages of phage treatment of gastrointestinal ailments over treatment with antibiotics appears to be a reduced disruption of gut flora.11
There are reports of prophylactic phage therapy success in treating Russian soldiers suffering from dysentery both during and after World War II, and even extensive trials in the southeastern Muslim Republics that showed ten-fold decreases in incidence, though generally with either poor or difficult to penetrate documentation.10 One well-controlled anti-dysentery trial149 was conducted in Tbilisi on 30,769 children. Neighborhoods were split up with one side of each street treated prophylactically with a phage cocktail and the other a placebo. The result was a 3.8-fold decrease in dysentery incidence with phage treatment. Similar follow up trials were undertaken with 20,000 and 5,000 children respectively as well as another against Salmonella-associated disease. Additionally, the Slopek et al.64 report of trials between 1981 and 1986 shows 91–100% positive cases for phage treatment of 42 “diseases of the digestive system” and six “infection diseases of the alimentary tract”. In Georgia the Intestiphage formulation is routinely employed prophylactically to prevent nosocomial infections, especially in pediatric hospitals, where such gastrointestinal infections are particularly prevalent. Dosing has traditionally been done with phages prepared in tablets, though since the break-up of the Soviet Union the tablet form has been seldom available, so the liquid form is used instead.
Relatively early in the development of phage therapy its power was directed towards the treatment of infections by Vibrio cholerae as well as treatment of wells in India with anti-cholerae phages, both with some success, as reviewed very extensively by Summers.25,42 The cholera prevention trials in particular were found to have such a beneficial effect that the government demanded the experiments be terminated early so that the control populations could be treated, though with the ironic consequence that results were not taken sufficiently seriously for subsequent institutionalization of this phage-preventative procedure to have become established.
Chanishvili et al.150 provide a 25-page, 23-reference chapter reviewing the Georgian literature on “Phage therapy against intestinal infections”. In the treatment of dysentery, highlights include phage production to densities up to 1012 phages/mL, the application of many mL per dose, the use of multiple doses, buffering to prevent phage loss during passage through the GI tract, and reductions in disease symptoms. Substantial reductions in mortality were reported. In addition to oral delivery, deep rectal delivery was employed in 1952 by Litsinik (as cited), who concluded that phage therapy was as effective as antibiotic therapy. Not all treatments resulted in positive results, however, perhaps in some cases because treatment was started too late.
Treatment of Salmonella infections as reviewed by Chanishvili et al.150 involved numerous routes of delivery, in contrast to the primarily oral delivery for anti-dysentery therapy. These included intravenous, intra-duodenal, intramuscular, rectal and oral. They note that 1 to 2°C increases in patient temperature were commonly reported prior to the lowering of temperatures. A common observation also is a shortening of the duration of illness following phage administration, though not all treatments and studies were successful in impacting the course of disease. Phage treatment of gastroenteral E. coli and Proteus infections are also described.
The most exciting and furthest-advanced current clinical trials of phage therapy using modern protocols are being carried out under the leadership of Harald Brüssow of the Nestlé Corporation, Lausanne, Switzerland (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00937274). Nestlé presently is sponsoring a study currently taking place in Dhaka, Bangladesh, that is designed to study the safety and efficacy of phage therapy in treating ETEC and EPEC induced diarrhea in children. The therapy is being applied to the standard oral rehydration solution and a novel cocktail of T4-like phages used in earlier safety trials as well as a commercially available Russian anti-E. coli phage cocktail (Microgen), and is being compared with a randomly and double-blind applied placebo. This work in particular demonstrates all of the key elements of modern clinical trials. In vivo replication of the family of phages being used has been studied in several mouse experiments.151,152 The phages being used for the key experimental arm of the trial were isolated from the stools of pediatric diarrhea patients in Bangladesh,136 with the potentially-useful broad-spectrum ones all turning out to be members of the highly-studied T4 family of phages.137 They have also reported the details of their very extensive genomics and gut-related infection studies of their several groups of T4-like phages in their set.133
Respiratory tract infections.
Respiratory infections can be differentiated into numerous types, though of course with phage therapy limited in efficacy to those which have a bacterial etiology. Here we briefly consider phage treatment of respiratory infections differentiating primarily between those that either don't or do involve cystic fibrosis (CF). For the former, Weber-Dabrowska et al.135 reported success in treating pneumonia in six cancer patients. Similarly, Slopek et al.64 report 86.7% positive cases (our calculation) for phage treatment of 180 “Diseases of the respiratory system”; see also reference 65. In terms of cystic fibrosis, a paper has been recently published describing successful treatment of P. aeruginosa infection of the lungs of a seven-year-old patient (using Pyophage) along with treatment of a S. aureus co-infection in the same patient using phage Sb-1, also successfully.153 The company previously known as Biocontrol (below) has received a grant from the US CF foundation to expand its anti-Pseudomonas phage therapy efforts to include treatment of children with CF.11 Success in treating infections in animal models of CF-associated infection has also been reported in references 154 and 155, as too has exploration of the utility of nebulization as a phage delivery strategy.156 Phage treatments of lung infections, however, can also be reached effectively in at least some circumstances from systemic circulation, as animal models have shown.155
Chronic otitis.
Chronic otitis, known less formerly as swimmer's ear, is a P. aeruginosa ear infection that in many cases can resist antibiotic treatment. The company, Biocontrol (recently acquired by Targeted Genetics of Seattle to form a new joint company, AmpliPhi Biosciences), has been developing anti-P. aeruginosa phages targeting this condition, having published similar animal studies using dogs.143,157 In 2009 they published the results of their double-blinded phase 1/2a (safety and small-number efficacy) trial in human patients also suffering from the condition.132 Increases in phage numbers in situ, microbiological improvements (reductions in bacterial presence), and reduction in disease symptoms in the phage-treated cohort but not the phage-negative controls were observed. No side effects were seen. Complete bacterial eradication was not observed, though this could be because only a single phage dose was administered. Note that Weber-Dabrowska et al.135 also report phage therapy success in treated purulent otitis media and Slopek et al.64 report 93.8% positive cases for phage treatment of 16 cases of “Conjunctivitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, otitis media”.
Urogenital tract infections.
Phages can be applied to treat various infections of the urogenetical systems either systemically, via direct injection such as into the bladder, or topical application. Eaton and Bayne-Jones in their 1934 14–16 report were convinced of the efficacious use of phage therapy against cystitis. Letwiewicz et al.158 describe phage application rectally to target Enterococcus faecalis infection of the prostate, with some success. In this case phages are presumed to be taken up through the rectal wall prior to gaining access to the prostate. The result of treatment was elimination of the target bacteria from prostatic fluid. Letarov et al.103 note that rectal phage suppositories are available on the Russian market. Slopek et al.64 report 92.9% positive cases for phage treatment of 42 “Diseases of the genitourinary tract”.
In the Chanishvili and Sharp7 book there is a chapter on “Phage therapy in urology” and a second on “Phage therapy in gynecology”. The former chapter159 indicates, in the case of Tsulukidze (1938), for example, that phage application was made directly into the bladder as well as the pelvis of the kidney: “In cases of acute cystitis a therapeutic effect was observed within 4–5 hours of the first administration and resulted in relief of pain, a decrease in the frequency of urination and a normalization of the composition of the urine. Full recovery was achieved within 1–3 days in all 13 cases (100%) however treatment of chronic forms of cystitis was less successful, with only a moderate improvement observed.”
Sepsis.
Sepsis refers to systemic infections resulting in a dangerous, whole-body inflammatory state. A related term, septicemia, is used to describe bacterial infections in which pathogens are present in the blood or lymph in substantial numbers, particularly as a consequence of bacterial growth within those tissues. The commonality is a dangerous, typically life-threatening infection that has disseminated systematically rather than remaining locally contained.
The Polish phage therapists have avoided intravenous phage treatments and this approach also has been largely avoided in Georgia, so there is far less modern, human-treatment experience to draw on than for most forms of phage therapy. The concern with fighting systemic infections using phages systemically is two-fold. First is the danger of the infection itself. This includes the potential to worsen infection symptoms given excessive bacterial lysis upon antibacterial application, but that is actually at least as likely with various other forms of treatment and may be partly mitigated by starting with fairly low levels of phage. The second is the fact that parenteral or systemic phage application requires greater levels of purification so as to avoid systemic exposure to endotoxins formed during phage production. Notwithstanding these concerns, some phage therapy of human systemic infections has been undertaken in modern times, generally using non-intravenous routes, such as intraperitoneally.
Weber-Dabrowska et al.160 review the impact of phage treatment of 94 patients with septic infections, all of whom had been treated with antibiotics prior to phage application. In 23 patients, antibiotic treatment was discontinued during phage application. 61 of the patients were afflicted with mixed infections and for the remaining 33 only a single etiology was identified. In the latter, 15 were S. aureus and the rest Gram negative. Phages were matched to presumed etiologies in all cases rather than applied as cocktails. In 80 cases, complete recovery was achieved while in the remaining 14 cases treatment was unsuccessful except for a drop in patient temperature. Weber-Dabrowska et al.135 report successfully treating 7 people who suffered similar infections while afflicted with cancer and Slopek et al.64 report 88.8% positive cases for phage treatment of 98 “Septicemias”.
In the Chanishvili and Sharp7 book there is a chapter on “Phage therapy against septic infections”, authored by Teimuraz Chanishvili,161 which includes the use of highly purified Staphylococcus phages by IV and other more invasive routes. In 1993, Pavlenishvili and Tsertsvadze162 explored, using a combination of per os phage therapy and enterosorbtion, the multi-day (7 to 12) treatment of sepsis of newborns, infants and other patients caused by gram-negative bacteria. Thus phages could attack the infection while, at the same time, at least some of the toxins produced in the course of infection, treatment, and presumably bacterial lysis could be sequestered within the gastrointestinal lumen by absorptive materials. The authors indicated that acute disease was shortened by about four days, on average, with “relatively fast improvement of the patients' general state compared with that revealed in the case of usual treatment… No patients revealed toxic, allergic, or pyrogenic or accessory phenomena…” Lastly, bacterial endocarditis, the infection of heart valves, has been successfully treated with bacteriophages, in France.163

Conclusion
Phage therapy has a long history, though for most of that history this approach has been neglected by the English-speaking western world. We show here, however, that there is much more in the literature than has generally been realized, with many studies demonstrating that phages as natural and self-amplifying antibacterial “drugs” could be used to safely and effectively treat or prevent many common human diseases of bacterial etiology. Especially in light of concerns regarding the serious menace of antibiotic resistance, as has been recently stressed by the World Health Organization (www.who.int/world-health-day/2011/en/), we believe that there is enough of at least semi-anecdotal evidence of efficacy to strongly recommend continued evaluation of this alternative antibacterial approach.

Description
Abstract Text
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This services R34 research study will provide important effectiveness pilot data to assess an intervention that includes a focus on adherence because poor adherence to depression treatment remains a significant impediment to improving care, in particular in the context of co morbid physical conditions such as hypertension. Training Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) who are already working in the practices to carry out the intervention will facilitate its deployment in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands. The primary aims of this proposal to be carried out in the primary care setting are: (1) Design an integrated intervention strategy to be carried out by LPNs who are already working in the practices to improve adherence to antidepressant treatment in the context of improving adherence to antihypertensive treatment for older primary care patients through integration of management of both depression and hypertension; (2) Test the feasibility and assess in a preliminary fashion the effectiveness of the integrated intervention strategy carried out by LPNs who are already working in the practices on the primary outcome of adherence to adequate antidepressant treatment by enrolling 100 adults aged 65 years and older with clinically significant depression and a systolic blood pressure (BP) > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (BP) > 90 mmHg for non-diabetics, or a systolic BP > 130 or a diastolic BP > 80 for diabetic patients. Exploratory outcomes that will be the primary outcomes of the future R01 will be depression response and remission, adherence to adequate antihypertensive treatment, and improved blood pressure control; and (3) Use data from this developmental study to develop an R01 for a full-scale randomized controlled trial of the intervention carried out by LPNs who are already working in the practices that integrates depression and hypertension management. The key components of the Integrated Care Intervention are: (1) integration of depression treatment with hypertension management; and (2) provision of an individualized program to improve adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications that recognizes patients' social and cultural context. This project can have a significant public health impact because we are testing an integrated intervention to be carried out by Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) that may facilitate its deployment in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal which grows out of an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) Award is to integrate depression treatment into care for hypertension so that a single program can assist the patients with depression and hypertension. A depression intervention designed to address hypertension, a major factor for CVD, would provide a model for integration of depression treatment with care for other chronic medical conditions among older adults in primary care settings. This project can have a significant public health impact because we are testing an integrated intervention to be carried out by Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) that may facilitate its deployment in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands.

Captain John Smith
Captain John Smith, based on an engraving done in 1616.
John Smith Map of 1616 (colorized by Preservation Virginia).
Captain John Smith was an adventurer, soldier, explorer and author. Through the telling of his early life, we can trace the developments of a man who became a dominate force in the eventual success of Jamestown and the establishment of its legacy as the first permanent English settlement in North America.

John Smith was baptized on January 9, 1580, at Saint Helena's Church in Willoughby, Lincolnshire, England. His parents were George and Alice Smith. George was a yeoman farmer who owned land in Lincolnshire and also rented land from Lord Willoughby, his landlord and relation by marriage.
As a young boy, John attended local grammar schools learning reading, writing, arithmetic, and Latin. Not wanting to be a farmer, John ran away at age 13 to become a sailor, but his father stopped him, making John work as an apprentice [a person who works for another in order to learn that trade] to a nearby merchant. In 1596, following the death of his father, John sailed for France and joined English soldiers fighting the Spanish there and in the Netherlands. A truce ended this fighting in 1598, and John returned to England a trained soldier.

Following another trip to France and to Scotland, Smith secluded himself in a wooded pasture on Lord Willoughby's property. Living in a shelter he built of tree branches, John learned how to live off the land, and he read books about the rules of war and politics. Lord Willoughby had an Italian nobleman, Signore Theodore Paleologue, visit Smith who helped him to improve his horsemanship and jousting skills. These lessons prepared Smith for his next adventure.
  Captain John Smith's adventures in Europe.
Unknown Artist
In 1600, learning of the war being fought between Christian forces of the Holy Roman Empire [HRE] and the Muslim Ottoman Turks, Smith set off for Austria to join the HRE army. On his way to Austria, Smith experienced several adventures, including serving on a pirate ship in the Mediterranean Sea. His pirate service earned him 500 gold pieces enabling him to complete his trip through Italy, Croatia and Slovenia to Austria where he joined the HRE army.

Smith fought against the Turks in battles waged in Slovenia, Hungary and Transylvania [Romania] earning several awards for his bravery in battle. One award was his promotion to captain, a title Smith remained proud of the rest of his life. The Prince of Transylvania gave Smith the title of ""English gentleman"", and with it a coat of arms that consisted of three Turks' heads representing the three Turks killed and beheaded by Smith in individual jousting duels. Smith had become a very accomplished soldier and leader. But his good fortune ended in 1602 when he was wounded and captured in battle and sold into Turkish slavery. Smith was forced to march 600 miles to Constantinople where a new adventure awaited the captain.

In Constantinople, the enslaved Smith was presented by his master as a gift to his fiancée, Charatza Tragbigzanda. According to Smith's account, Charatza became infatuated with him, and apparently in an attempt to convert Smith to Islam, she sent him to work for her brother, Tymor Bashaw, who ran an agricultural station in present-day Russia, near Rostov. Instead of instructing Smith, Tymore mistreated him by shaving his head, placing an iron ring around his neck, giving him little to eat and often beating him. During one such beating, Smith overpowered Tymore, killing him and fleeing his enslavement using Tymore's horse and clothing. Traveling for days, unsure of his route, Smith was befriended by a Russian and his wife, Callamatta, whom Smith called this ""good lady"". Their assistance helped Smith regain his strength and begin his travels across the remainder of Russia, Ukraine, Germany, France, Spain, and Morocco before finally returning to England in 1604. One author estimates Smith's travels from 1600-1604 covered nearly 11,000 miles! The captain was finally home, but not for long.
  Smith's military exploits impressed prominent men in England, especially Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, a man intent on founding an English colony in the Chesapeake region of Virginia. Gosnold, and other important men in London, organized the Virginia Company of London and were granted a charter by King James I on April 10, 1606, to establish a colony in Virginia. In December 1606, the company dispatched three ships carrying 104 settlers, including Captain John Smith, to start this colony.

Established on May 13, 1607, the colony was named Jamestown, in honor of the king. [It became the first permanent English settlement in North America, and first of 13 English colonies that won independence from England and became the first 13 states of the United States of America.] Jamestown's fate hung in the balance for many years, and some historians credit Jamestown's survival to the efforts of Captain Smith.

Originally, the colony was governed by a council of seven men, and Captain Smith had been named by the Virginia Company to serve on this council. Ironically, he was arrested for mutiny on the voyage to Virginia, narrowly escaping being hanged, and arrived at Jamestown a prisoner. Fortunately, through the efforts of Jamestown's minister, Reverend Robert Hunt, he was allowed to assume his council position.

John Smith's Map of 1612.
The first months of Jamestown's existence were very difficult due to food shortages, unhealthy drinking water, disease, occasional skirmishing with the Powhatan Indians, and ineffectual council leadership due to bickering and the untimely death of Bartholomew Gosnold. In the fall, Smith conducted expeditions to Powhatan villages securing food for the desperate colonists. On one such expedition in December he was captured by a large Powhatan hunting party and led on a long trek to various Powhatan villages, ultimately being brought before the paramount chief of the Powhatan people, Wahunsenacawh, better known as Chief Powhatan.

This encounter resulted in the famous story written by Smith of being saved from execution by Pocahontas, Chief Powhatan's daughter. [Most historians and anthropologists believe this event occurred, but Smith misinterpreted its meaning not realizing it was a symbolic adoption ceremony of Smith into the world of the Powhatan people.] The captain was released shortly after the ceremony and escorted back to James Fort. By this time, only 38 of the 104 settlers were still alive. More settlers arrived at Jamestown in January 1608, and Chief Powhatan sent some food to the English, but misfortune struck in early January with the accidental burning down of most of the fort. The extreme cold that winter, coupled with the loss of shelter and food from the fire, led to the deaths of more than half of the new settlers.
  Smith tried to focus the colonists on their immediate needs and not spend valuable time searching for gold, but he wrote, ""There was no talk, no hope, no work but dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold --- such a bruit of GOLD that one mad fellow desired to be buried in the sands, lest they should by their art make gold of his bones!"" Despite these fruitless endeavors to find gold, the colony became more stable as additional settlers and food arrived. In the spring of 1608, Captain Smith undertook one of the most important European explorations in North America: the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.
On two separate voyages, beginning in June and ending in September 1608, Captain Smith and several of his fellow colonists, traveling in an open barge about 30 feet long and 8 feet wide, explored 2,500 miles of the Chesapeake Bay and many of its tributaries such as the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. From these trips Smith created a very accurate map of the area replete with locations of various Indian villages and other vital information. This exploration and map of the Chesapeake Bay region were some of Captain Smith's greatest accomplishments and enduring legacies.

In September 1608, Smith was elected president of the colony and head of the council. He implemented common sense regulations for the colony such as, ""… he that will not work shall not eat…."" Under Smith's leadership the death toll dropped dramatically, the fort was repaired, crops planted, a well dug, trees cut into clapboards, and products such as pitch, tar, and soap ash were produced for shipment back to England. Even during times of food shortages, Smith sent colonists to live with the Powhatan Indians confident no harm would befall them as he believed Chief Powhatan and his people feared him and English weapons.

Unfortunately, relations were tenuous between the English and the Powhatan Indians as Smith's diplomacy often turned violent taking food and destroying villages. The final meeting of Captain Smith and Chief Powhatan occurred in January 1609 at Werowocomoco, Powhatan's capital, where each leader plotted the other's death while conducting civil negotiations. Ironically, Chief Powhatan's plan to kill Smith and his colleagues was foiled due to a timely warning given Smith by Pocahontas! Each leader escaped destruction, but Smith's harsh diplomacy heightened the animosity between the two cultures and open warfare soon erupted.
Captain Smith did not witness the First Anglo Powhatan War [1609-1614] or the Starving Time [winter of 1609-1610] having suffered a severe injury from a gunpowder explosion in the fall of 1609 forcing him to return to England. Smith remained interested in Jamestown wanting to return, but Virginia Company officials refused his requests. Always the adventurer, Smith undertook a voyage in 1614 exploring the shores of northern Virginia, which he mapped and re-named New England. Intending to establish an English colony there, Smith's efforts were frustrated when he was captured by French pirates while sailing to New England in 1615. Escaping from the pirates, Smith returned to England where he wrote extensively about his life's adventures. [In 1620, the Pilgrims nearly selected Captain Smith to be their military advisor but instead selected Miles Standish, however, they did use Smith's map of New England.] Captain John Smith died in London on June 21, 1631, and was buried at St. Sepulchre's Church.

John Smith's best biographer, Philip L. Barbour, once wrote, ""Captain John Smith has lived on in legend far more thrillingly than even he could have foreseen. Much has been made-largely by ill-informed people-of trivial inconsequences in his narratives, and controversy has at times raged rather absurdly. … To be sure, much of what John Smith wrote was exaggerated. … Rare indeed was the man who wrote in Stuart times without ornament, without exuberance. Let it only be said that nothing John Smith wrote has yet been found to be a lie.""

Abstract Text
DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) Abstract: Engineering Effective Revascularization Technologies for Ischemia in Disease States Chronic myocardial ischemia disease affects more than 27 milion patients in the United States and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Peripheral ischemic is even more prevalent being present in 12-20% of the population aged 65 and older in the US. Ischemic disease most often occurs as a result of arterial narrowing due to long-standing atherosclerotic disease processes. This arterial remodeling leads to a reduction in blood flow and, ultimately, causes organ dysfunction and failure. Current therapies for treating ischemia include the use of percutaneous interventions to physically open the artery or surgical methods to reroute blood flow to the poorly perfused tissue. These methods have significant limitations and eventually fail in the long-term. The most effective means to treat ischemic disease would be to revascularize the tissue by stimulating the development of native vasculature. Many studies have been done to attempt to use growth factors, growth factor genes and implanted cells to facilitate revascularization of ischemic tissues. While these treatments have been effective in experimental models, clinical trials have shown them to have limited efficacy in treating human disease. This proposal aims to understand why growth factor based therapies have failed to treat ischemia in patients and seeks to create novel therapeutics to increase growth factor effectiveness in this context. Our fundamental hypothesis is that the reason these therapies have failed is that tissues with long standing disease and exhausted compensatory mechanisms are unable to respond with appropriate growth factor signaling. Through basic studies on diseased cells and tissues, we will perform a detailed analysis of signaling pathways to identify the reasons for the ineffective growth factor signaling. We recently developed novel techniques allowing the replacement of missing receptors and co-receptors on the cell surface. Using these and other innovative methods we will pursue novel therapeutic drug formulations that can be utilized as co-treatments to allow growth factors to be efficacious in the presence of clinical disease. We will test these new treatments in clinically relevant animal models of peripheral and myocardial ischemia. Together, the studies performed and the tools developed will increase our understanding of how tissues become resistant to revascularization therapies and may lead to more effective treatments for this widespread and debilitating disease. Public Health Relevance: Chronic myocardial ischemia disease affects about 27 million patients in the United States and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Peripheral ischemic is even more prevalent being present in 12-20% of the population aged 65 and older in the US.

Description
Abstract Text
DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) Abstract: Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, yet nearly all of us learn do it effortlessly. The ability to communicate through speech is often described as the unique and defining trait of human behavior. Despite its importance, the basic neural mechanisms that govern our ability to speak fluently remain unresolved. This proposal addresses two fundamental questions at the crossroads of linguistics, systems neuroscience, and biomedical engineering: 1) How are the coordinated movements of articulation functionally represented in human speech motor cortex? 2) Can we apply this new knowledge to decode speech motor cortex for the practical implementation of a neuro-prosthetic communication device? Our studies should greatly advance understanding of how the speech motor cortex encodes the precise control of articulation during speech production as well as determine whether this control system can be harnessed for novel rehabilitative strategies. Three potential areas of impact are: Neurobiology of Language, where results will shed light on neurophysiologic mechanisms of speech motor control; Human Neurophysiology, where insight gained may suggest novel methods for multivariate analysis of distributed population neural activity; and Translational NeuroEngineering, where results will apply directly to the development of a speech neuro-prosthetic device. We propose to investigate the functional organization of the speech motor cortex during consonant- vowel syllable production, and during articulatory compensation in the context of pertubation. Our methods utilizing safe, high-density, large-scale intracranial electrode recordings in humans represent a significant advancement over current noninvasive neuroimaging approaches. To accomplish this, we must innovate new, integrative approaches to speech motor control research. We will also employ novel and as of yet unproven analyses to 'read-out' speech motor cortex in real-time. Given that these ideas concerning the neural basis of speech production and its strategic application for neuroprosthetics are new and relatively untested, the level of risk in our proposal is substantially higher than in traditional investigator grants. The most debilitating aspect of profound paralysis due to trauma, stroke, or disease is loss of the ability to speak, which leads to profound social isolation. Our research focuses on novel methodologies gained in previous studies of speech perception in the human temporal lobe. We wish to broaden the impact of our research and innovate a related, and highly complementary field in the neurobiology of speech motor control. Public Health Relevance: Discovering the neural mechanisms of speech production has major implications for understanding a large number of communication disorders including mutism, stuttering, apraxia of speech, and aphasia. In addition, the proposed research seeks to translate critical knowledge on the neural control of speech to develop algorithms for a practical communication neuroprosthetic device to provide immediate, practical benefit to patients suffering from these disabling neurological conditions.

DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) Abstract: The 20th century witnessed several major advances in medicine. Perhaps most important were the discovery of antibiotics for bacterial infections and effective vaccines for several major viruses. Unfortunately, the creation of effective vaccines for bacteria has lagged behind analogous anti-viral strategies. Compounded with the rise in antibiotic resistance and a lack of interest from the pharmaceutical industry in pursuing novel antibiotics, we risk losing the fight against bacterial pathogens. Described herein is an unconventional strategy to exploit bacterial toxins as both novel targets for antibacterial agents and antigens for vaccine development. To intelligently address the increasing threat posed by bacterial pathogens, more effort is needed to uncover the molecular underpinnings of virulence. Our group specializes in the use of bioinformatics, in vitro reconstitution, and genetic manipulation to identify and characterize gene clusters that are responsible for the biosynthesis of virulence- promoting cytolysins. The best-known toxin in this family is the highly modified peptide, streptolysin S (SLS, produced by Streptococcus pyogenes). SLS production is required for the infective process, but not essential life processes. Our work has uncovered SLS-like toxins are synthesized by at least three other notorious human pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Clostridium botulinum. We aim to study the potential role of the SLS-like toxin in an additional organism, Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), which causes Lyme disease. Although widely known, the Bb molecular mechanism of pathogenesis is inadequately defined. If the SLS-like toxin was indeed employed during Bb infections, this would represent the first demonstration of toxin utilization in this family of organisms and would prompt a major revision of borrelioses. Because bacteria typically employ disparate pathogenic mechanisms, the conserved, SLS-like pathway provides a rare opportunity to develop more broadly applicable, yet targeted countermeasures. From our perspective, new antimicrobial strategies should directly target the pathogenic mechanism, rather than DNA replication, protein synthesis, or the cell wall. This approach holds enormous potential, as these drugs will theoretically be resistant to resistance. This project will identify inhibitors of SLS toxin biosynthesis for the specific purpose of developing novel antibacterials. Moreover, SLS is non-immunogenic, rendering it an unfeasible candidate for vaccine development. We have succeeded in generating attenuated variants with the anticipation that these can be used for raising toxin-neutralizing antibodies. The notion of immunizing against a bacterial toxin represents a potentially general strategy for future vaccine development. With this proposal, we aim to not only fundamentally shift the accepted view of Bb pathogenesis, but also to challenge the paradigm that antibiotics must kill bacteria and non-immunogenic toxins are intractable vaccine candidates. These seemingly unrelated goals are actually quite intertwined. Our approach rests on the philosophy that a more complete understanding of toxin biosynthetic pathways and chemical structure can be rationally exploited to design novel therapeutics. Public Health Relevance: Bacterial pathogens employ numerous mechanisms to evade the human immune system. We have discovered a novel strategy within the organism that causes Lyme Disease, who's pathogenesis remains largely enigmatic. A greater understanding of these processes will lay the foundation for developing the next generation of antimicrobial drugs.

Abstract
Opioid dependence is one of the most severe drug dependencies. Naltrexone is a medication that completely blocks the subjective and other effects of opioids and, when administered to detoxified opioid addicts and taken as directed, prevents relapse and helps maintain abstinence. The major problem with naltrexone is poor compliance, particularly in countries in which there is a treatment alternative based on substitution of illicit opioids such as heroin with orally administered opioid agonists (methadone) or partial agonist/antagonists (buprenorphine). In Russia, substitution therapy is forbidden by law, and naltrexone is the only available pharmacotherapy for heroin dependence. Due to the lack of alternatives to naltrexone and stronger family control of compliance (adherence), naltrexone is more effective for relapse prevention and abstinence stabilization in Russia than in Western countries. Long-acting, sustained-release formulations (injectable and implantable) seem particularly effective compared with oral formulations. This article summarizes the results of studies conducted in Russia during the past 10 years that demonstrate these points.

Introduction
Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat opioid dependence in 1984. Approval was based primarily on its pharmacologic profile, as it blocks opioid effects by antagonism at the μ-opioid receptors [1•]. The blockade is competitive, and the degree of blockade depends on the relative concentration of agonists to antagonists and their affinity for opioid receptors. Naltrexone is a perfect antagonist for treating heroin dependence, as 50 mg (one tablet) blocks the subjective effects of heroin for 24 to 36 h; it is easy to administer (one tablet per day or two tablets every other day), safe (no common serious adverse events if used in recommended doses), well-tolerated (a relatively small number of side effects), and does not have addictive potential; and tolerance does not develop to the opioid antagonism.
However, one problem markedly reduces naltrexone’s efficacy and has limited its use for treating heroin and other forms of opioid dependence worldwide: patients often do not like it and do not take it on a daily basis. The dropout rate with oral naltrexone has been better in the limited number of patients in whom there is substantial external motivation to remain abstinent, such as physicians who are in monitoring programs and could lose their license if they relapse, those involved in the criminal justice system who could go to prison if they relapse, and those facing loss of employment [1•, 2–4].
A few US studies have shown positive effects with psychosocial or behavioral therapies. In two, contingency management combined with naltrexone was helpful [5, 6]. In another, naltrexone combined with individual [7] and group [2] psychotherapy yielded positive effects. A third tested a behavioral therapy that used rewards for negative urine tests [8]; however, it had a relatively limited effect and was identified by Nunes et al. [9] as one of several examples indicating that there appears to be a ceiling effect on the degree to which behavioral interventions can be used to improve naltrexone treatment outcomes.
Recent World Health Organization guidelines for the pharmacologic treatment of opioid dependence suggest that the limited evidence available demonstrates that in dependent opioid users who have withdrawn from opioids, those treated with naltrexone are less likely to use heroin or engage in criminal activity than those who do not take naltrexone, but the proportion who continue taking naltrexone has been very low [10••]. However, our recent studies of naltrexone for treating opioid dependence in St. Petersburg, Russia, have shown that in some cultural settings, naltrexone may be much more effective. In particular, Russian law forbids substitution therapy for opioid dependence with methadone or buprenorphine. Naltrexone is the only specific pharmacotherapy that is currently approved for use in the Russian Federation and is available as an oral tablet in extended-release formulations. The results of studies using these formulations are summarized below.

Studies of Oral Naltrexone
Naltrexone Only
Our first relatively small (n=52 patients), double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of naltrexone for opioid dependence began in the late-1990s [11]. At that time, Russia faced a dual epidemic of HIV and heroin addiction that had been spreading rapidly. Treatment of opioid dependence consisted of detoxification and drug-free rehabilitation, but relapse rates were high. We hypothesized that naltrexone may be an effective treatment in Russia for several reasons: 1) heroin addicts are mostly young people living with their parents, who are usually the initiators of treatment and can control the daily process of taking naltrexone; 2) heroin addiction is generally not accompanied by use of other drugs; and 3) use of agonists for addiction treatment is illegal. Thus, naltrexone is the only pharmacotherapy available for treating this disorder. That pilot study evaluated the efficacy of naltrexone for preventing relapse to heroin addiction and reducing HIV risk in a Russian cultural setting. A total of 52 heroin addicts who completed detoxification at addiction treatment hospitals in St. Petersburg and provided informed consent (mean age, 22 years; dependent on heroin for 2.5 years on average) were randomly assigned to a double-blind, 6-month course of biweekly manualized drug counseling and oral naltrexone, 50 mg/d, or counseling and identical-looking placebo. A close family member (e.g., mother, spouse) agreed to supervise daily dosing. Drug testing and brief evaluations were done at each biweekly visit. Medication compliance was evaluated using a riboflavin marker; more extensive psychometric evaluations were done at 3 and 6 months. A total of 81 patients were asked if they would be interested in participating: 62 gave informed consent, and 52 met study entrance criteria and were randomly assigned. Significant differences in retention and relapse favoring naltrexone were seen beginning at 1 month and continuing throughout the study. At the end of 6 months, 12 of the 27 naltrexone patients (44.4%) remained in the study and had not relapsed, compared with 4 of 25 placebo patients (16%) (P<0.05). Among patients who remained in the study, compliance with medication measured by riboflavin in the urine was high (85%–95%), probably a result of the family involvement. Reductions in HIV risk, alcohol use, anxiety, depression, and anhedonia, and improvement in overall function were substantial and about equal in both groups among those who were retained in treatment. However, the proportion of those retained in treatment was significantly higher in the naltrexone group. Thus, the study demonstrated that cultural factors unique to Russia are associated with greater interest and compliance with naltrexone than in the United States [11]. Because heroin addiction is the main route of transmission of HIV in Russia, naltrexone seemed likely to improve treatment outcome and in turn help reduce the spread of HIV if it could be made more widely available. The major limitation for its widespread use is cost: a monthly supply costs about $100 (United States).
Thus, although our first study showed a clear advantage for naltrexone, the number of patients was relatively small, dropout continued to be a problem, and naltrexone did not reduce protracted withdrawal-related psychiatric symptoms. Because an earlier study showed that a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; citalopram) reduced anxiety, depression, and other protracted withdrawal-related symptoms but did not prevent relapse [12], we hypothesized that combining naltrexone with an SSRI might be additive, with the antidepressant alleviating protracted withdrawal-related symptoms and improving adherence to naltrexone and treatment outcome.
Naltrexone in Combination with Other Psychoactive Medications
Naltrexone and a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Although our first double-blind pilot study demonstrated that naltrexone was more effective than placebo for relapse prevention in heroin addicts in Russia [11], it provided no data to indicate that naltrexone itself reduced the depression, anxiety, and anhedonia that are typically associated with heroin dependence and withdrawal following detoxification. It is possible that psychiatric symptoms increase the risk for dropout and relapse, and, therefore, antidepressants might alleviate these symptoms and thus improve results of naltrexone therapy. Our next study aimed to test this hypothesis using fluoxetine with and without naltrexone [13]. We chose fluoxetine, as it is approved for use in Russia and was offered at reduced cost by Gideon Richter (Budapest, Hungary), a pharmaceutical company that has provided psychiatric medications to Russia since the end of World War II. This second study was much larger: 280 heroin addicts who completed detoxification at addiction treatment hospitals in St. Petersburg and provided informed consent were included in a 6-month course of biweekly drug counseling and randomly assigned under double-dummy and double-blind conditions to one of four medication groups of 70 participants each: naltrexone (N, 50 mg daily) plus fluoxetine (F, 20 mg daily); naltrexone plus fluoxetine placebo (FP); naltrexone placebo (NP) plus fluoxetine; or naltrexone placebo plus fluoxetine placebo. The primary outcome was relapse to opioid (heroin) dependence. Urine drug testing and brief psychiatric evaluations were conducted at each biweekly visit, and medication compliance was evaluated biweekly using a riboflavin marker; more extensive psychiatric evaluations were done at 3 and 6 months. Results showed that 414 patients were asked if they would be interested in participating, 343 agreed, and 280 met study entrance criteria and were randomly assigned. At the end of 6 months, 43% of participants in the N plus F group remained in the study and had not relapsed, as compared with 36% in the N plus FP group, 21% in the NP plus F group, and 10% in the NP plus FP group. Based on the survival analysis and retention rate in 6 months, both N plus F and N plus FP were more effective than NP plus FP (P<0.001) and NP plus F (P< 0.01). Fluoxetine (NP + F) did not differ significantly from NP plus FP, and N plus F did not differ from naltrexone alone (N + FP; P=0.2). However, women in the N plus F group showed a trend toward an advantage when compared with women receiving naltrexone and fluoxetine placebo (N + FP; P=0.08), probably due to a higher level of depression, anxiety, and anhedonia in women at study intake compared with men. Thus, it was confirmed in this larger study that naltrexone was more effective than placebo for relapse prevention in opioid addicts in Russia. In addition, naltrexone and fluoxetine, or naltrexone alone, were both more effective than fluoxetine alone, although the combination of naltrexone and fluoxetine had a tendency to be more effective than naltrexone alone in women [13]. Overall, the antidepressant did not dramatically improve the naltrexone treatment outcome. It should be added that oral naltrexone was generally well-tolerated, the number of side effects was limited, and neither serious adverse events nor lethal overdose occurred.
Naltrexone and Presynaptic, α-adrenergic Agonists A small pilot study of opioid-dependent patients (n=18) found that a combination of naltrexone and lofexidine (a presynaptic α-adrenergic agonist that has antihypertensive and stress protective properties and reduces opioid withdrawal) may improve naltrexone outcome [14]. The antihypertensive medication lofexidine is used commonly in the United Kingdom and less often in the United States to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal. A pilot study by Sinha and colleagues [14] at Yale University School of Medicine suggested that lofexidine can enhance success rates among patients taking maintenance naltrexone and help them avoid relapse to opioids. After obtaining informed consent that explained all study procedures, the researchers stabilized 18 opioid-detoxified men and women on naltrexone (50 mg) and lofexidine (2.4 mg) daily for 1 month. They then continued all patients on naltrexone for four more weeks but kept eight on lofexidine and gave ten others identical-looking pills containing lofexidine doses that were tapered to zero over several days. Of the 13 patients who completed the study, 80% of those who continued to receive combination therapy submitted opiate-free urine samples throughout the 4-week period, compared with 25% of those tapered to placebo. A follow-up laboratory session that exposed ten of the patients to stressful and opiate-related stimuli showed that lofexidine—but not placebo lofexidine—reduced the patients’ reaction to stress, stress-induced opiate craving, and negative emotions (e. g., anger), all of which can trigger relapse [14]. However, these results are considered very preliminary because of the small sample size.
We are presently conducting a large (n=300 opioid-dependent patients), randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, four-cell study of naltrexone and guanfacine (another presynaptic α-adrenergic ligand used to treat hypertension) in collaboration with Dr. T. Kosten of Baylor College of Medicine. An interim analysis of half the sample did not find a significant additive effect of guanfacine on preventing relapse; however, final conclusions cannot be drawn until analyses have been completed on the entire sample.
In summary, combining naltrexone with fluoxetine (an SSRI) or an α-adrenergic agonist has not demonstrated a significant improvement in treatment outcome, and we have decided to change the direction of our naltrexone research and study long-acting, sustained-release formulations, as they may help solve the problem of compliance.

Studies with Long-Acting, Sustained-Release Formulations
Implantable Naltrexone
The first long-acting, sustained-release naltrexone formulation available in Russia was an implant (Prodetoxon; Fidelity Capital, Moscow, Russia). It contains 1000 mg of naltrexone that is slowly released after being inserted subcutaneously in the abdominal wall via a small incision. It was registered in Russia in 2005 and shown to block opioids for 2 months, but this time frame was extended to 3 months during the past year, based on clinical experience. As of this writing, it is the only officially registered naltrexone implant in the world. We are currently completing a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, randomized study of this naltrexone formulation. The final group of patients (n=306) has completed treatment, and outcome data are not yet available. However, we completed an interim analysis of 190 patients in December 2008 [15].
In this study, recently detoxified heroin addicts were randomly assigned to a 6-month course of biweekly drug counseling and one of three medication groups: naltrexone implant every other month plus oral naltrexone placebo (NI + OP, n=66); placebo implant plus oral naltrexone, 50 mg/d (PI + ON, n=62); or double-placebo (PI + OP, n= 62). Medications were administered under double-blind, double-dummy conditions. Urine drug testing and brief psychiatric evaluations were done at each biweekly visit, with more extensive assessments at 3 and 6 months. Oral medication compliance was evaluated using a urine riboflavin marker. An interim analysis showed a clear advantage favoring the implant over oral naltrexone and placebo implant. In particular, the treatment effectiveness score (a sum of heroin-positive and missed urines) favored the implant group over the other two (P<0.01): at the end of the 6-month treatment phase, the treatment effectiveness score in the NI plus OP group was 63%, compared with 87% in the PI plus ON group and 86% in the PI plus OP group. Survival analysis also revealed significantly greater retention in the NI plus OP group compared with the other two groups. The percentage of nonsurgical adverse events (unrelated to minor surgery required to insert the implant) was less than 1%, with no difference between groups; however, surgical side effects (wound infections, local site reactions) were higher in the NI plus OP group (6% of all implantations) compared with the two other groups (1%). All adverse events were successfully treated, and no serious adverse events occurred.
No significant differences were detected between groups in physical and social anhedonia, thus implying that the long-acting naltrexone did not interfere with normal pleasurable stimuli. Similar to our studies with oral naltrexone, psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, opioid craving) were markedly reduced in patients who remained in treatment and did not relapse, and no differences were noted between groups for those who remained in treatment and did not relapse. The efficacy of oral naltrexone was lower in this implant study compared with the previous oral naltrexone studies [11, 13], which may be related to the age of opioid addicts and the degree to which family members could supervise compliance. For example, the mean age of patients in the implant study was 28–29 years, significantly higher than previous studies, in which the average was 21–23 years. These older patients were less likely to be living with relatives, which made it more difficult for the relatives to supervise compliance.
In summary, the Russian long-acting, sustained-release naltrexone implant (Prodetoxon) appears to be safe and more effective than the oral naltrexone and placebo implant for prevention of relapse to heroin dependence [15]. The blockade provided by Prodetoxon is very difficult to override. However, it is possible to accomplish it with a very high dose of heroin (~10-fold compared with the usual daily dose) [16•]. Attempts to overcome the naltrexone implant blockade are not common and are usually unsuccessful because naltrexone has high affinity for the μ-opioid receptor. If a patient can obtain a large dose of heroin or other opiate, he or she may be able to feel the opioid effects, but they are usually attenuated. Patients on naltrexone have survived even a very high dose of heroin [16•]. Of course, a patient who stops naltrexone and then returns to his or her pre-naltrexone dose of heroin will have diminished tolerance and could suffer a serious or fatal overdose.
Results of two recent randomized trials of another naltrexone implant developed in Australia also demonstrated its advantages over oral naltrexone [17•] and usual-treatment aftercare [18•]. However, these studies did not have a placebo group. Other long-acting, slow-release naltrexone formulations (implantable and injectable) for opioid dependence are being developed and tested [19••].
Implantable naltrexone formulations have several limitations. First, they require a minor surgical procedure that carries with it the risk of wound infections and cosmetic defects. Second, it is possible for the patient to remove the implant within the first few weeks, as Prodetoxon slowly dissolves and can be removed reasonably intact within the first few weeks. Third, in some patients (< 10%), the implant appeared to block opioids for less than 2 months. Therefore, a long-acting, slow-release formulation that is injectable and simple to use and does not require surgery might have some advantages over an implant formulation.
Injectable Naltrexone
Three sustained-release, injectable naltrexone formulations have been developed in the past 10–15 years: Vivitrol (Alkermes, Waltham, MA), Depotrex (Biotech, Bethesda, MD), and Naltrel (DrugAbuse Sciences, Hayward, CA) [20]. Only Vivitrol has US Food and Drug Administration approval. It is administered via a monthly intramuscular injection and approved for prevention of relapse to alcohol dependence. It is available in the United States, Europe, and Russia, and recent studies have found that a monthly intramuscular injection also blocks the subjective effects of opioids [21].
The first published controlled study of a sustained-release formulation for preventing relapse to opioid dependence in the United States was conducted with Depotrex [22]. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 detoxified, heroin-dependent adults received placebo (n=18), 192 mg (n=20), or 384 mg (n=22) of injectable depot naltrexone monthly for 2 months along with twice-weekly relapse prevention therapy [22]. The 192-mg and 384-mg naltrexone groups had a significantly higher (60% and 68%, respectively) percentage of patients remaining in treatment at the end of 2 months than the placebo group (39%). Time to dropout had a significant dose-related effect, with mean time to dropout of 27, 36, and 48 days for the placebo, 192 mg of naltrexone, and 384 mg of naltrexone groups, respectively. The mean percentage of urine samples negative for opioids across the study was lowest for the placebo group (25.3%) and highest for the 384 mg of naltrexone group (61.9%). However, when the data were recalculated without the assumption that missing urine samples were positive, there were no significant differences between the groups on percentage of negative urine tests for opioids.
The effectiveness of Vivitrol for preventing relapse to opioid dependence is currently being studied in Russia in a phase three, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial whose preliminary results have not yet been published but were released very recently by Alkermes on its corporate website [23]. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of injectable naltrexone compared with placebo in opioid-dependent individuals who were recently detoxified and abstinent from opioids for a minimum of 7 days prior to treatment initiation. A total of 250 participants were randomly assigned to receive once-monthly injections of injectable naltrexone, 380 mg, or placebo in combination with counseling for 6 months. The primary efficacy end point was the response profile based on the rate of urine drug screens that were free of opioids during the last 20 weeks of the 24-week, double-blind treatment period, as measured by the cumulative distribution of negative urine screens. Secondary efficacy end points were treatment retention, craving, self-reported opioid use, and relapse to physiologic opioid dependence. All participants who completed the randomized portion of the study were eligible to continue in an open-label extension phase and receive Vivitrol once monthly for an additional 13 months in combination with counseling. Safety measures included the number of adverse events and number of serious advised events [23]. Results of this study had not been published as of this writing; however, a press release recently posted to the Alkermes website indicated that this study met all its primary and secondary efficacy end points, with the Vivitrol generally well-tolerated [23]. As earlier with the implantable naltrexone formulation [16•], one case report demonstrated that it is possible to overcome opioid blockade with the injectable formulation; this event occurred during the third week after an injection [24•].

Conclusions
Studies conducted in St. Petersburg, Russia, for more than a decade have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of different naltrexone formulations (oral, implantable, injectable) for relapse prevention and maintenance of abstinence in detoxified opioid addicts. The positive results from different formulations seem related to two cultural factors. One is that relatives can be recruited to supervise daily dosing of the oral formulation. However, this advantage is decreasing as the addicted population ages. The second is that substitution therapy is not available; thus, naltrexone is the only effective medication available, which makes it easier to motivate patients to use it. Preliminary findings from studies of long-acting, slow-release formulations of naltrexone (implantable and injectable) suggest that they are more effective than the oral formulations and are likely to be important additions to current treatments. How they compare with maintenance treatment using methadone or buprenorphine in settings in which these three treatment options are available is a topic for future studies.

Transnational Organized Crime: A Growing Threat to National and International Security
Transnational organized crime (TOC) poses a significant and growing threat to national and international security, with dire implications for public safety, public health, democratic institutions, and economic stability across the globe. Not only are criminal networks expanding, but they also are diversifying their activities, resulting in the convergence of threats that were once distinct and today have explosive and destabilizing effects. This Strategy organizes the United States to combat TOC networks that pose a strategic threat to Americans and to U.S. interests in key regions.
Penetration of State Institutions, Corruption, and Threats to Governance. Developing countries with weak rule of law can be particularly susceptible to TOC penetration. TOC penetration of states is deepening, leading to co-option in a few cases and further weakening of governance in many others. The apparent growing nexus in some states among TOC groups and elements of government—includ­ing intelligence services—and high-level business figures represents a significant threat to economic growth and democratic institutions. In countries with weak governance, there are corrupt officials who turn a blind eye to TOC activity. TOC networks insinuate themselves into the political process in a variety of ways. This is often accomplished through direct bribery (but also by having members run for office); setting up shadow economies; infiltrating financial and security sectors through coercion or corruption; and positioning themselves as alternate providers of governance, security, services, and livelihoods. As they expand, TOC networks may threaten stability and undermine free markets as they build alliances with political leaders, financial institutions, law enforcement, foreign intelligence, and security agen­cies. TOC penetration of governments is exacerbating corruption and undermining governance, rule of law, judicial systems, free press, democratic institution-building, and transparency. Further, events in Somalia have shown how criminal control of territory and piracy ransoms generate significant sums of illicit revenue and promote the spread of government instability.
Threats to the Economy, U.S. Competitiveness, and Strategic Markets. TOC threatens U.S. economic interests and can cause significant damage to the world financial system through its subversion, exploi­tation, and distortion of legitimate markets and economic activity. U.S. business leaders worry that U.S. firms are being put at a competitive disadvantage by TOC and corruption, particularly in emerging markets where many perceive that rule of law is less reliable. The World Bank estimates about $1 trillion is spent each year to bribe public officials, causing an array of economic distortions and damage to legitimate economic activity. The price of doing business in countries affected by TOC is also rising as companies budget for additional security costs, adversely impacting foreign direct investment in many parts of the world. TOC activities can lead to disruption of the global supply chain, which in turn dimin­ishes economic competitiveness and impacts the ability of U.S. industry and transportation sectors to be resilient in the face of such disruption. Further, transnational criminal organizations, leveraging their relationships with state-owned entities, industries, or state-allied actors, could gain influence over key commodities markets such as gas, oil, aluminum, and precious metals, along with potential exploitation of the transportation sector.
Crime-Terror-Insurgency Nexus. Terrorists and insurgents increasingly are turning to TOC to gener­ate funding and acquire logistical support to carry out their violent acts. The Department of Justice reports that 29 of the 63 organizations on its FY 2010 Consolidated Priority Organization Targets list, which includes the most significant international drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) threatening the United States, were associated with terrorist groups. Involvement in the drug trade by the Taliban and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is critical to the ability of these groups to fund terrorist activity. We are concerned about Hizballah’s drug and criminal activities, as well as indications of links between al-Qa`ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb and the drug trade. Further, the terrorist organization al-Shabaab has engaged in criminal activities such as kidnapping for ransom and extortion, and may derive limited fees from extortion or protection of pirates to generate funding for its operations. While the crime-terror nexus is still mostly opportunistic, this nexus is critical nonetheless, especially if it were to involve the successful criminal transfer of WMD material to terrorists or their penetration of human smuggling networks as a means for terrorists to enter the United States.
Expansion of Drug Trafficking. Despite demonstrable counterdrug successes in recent years, particu­larly against the cocaine trade, illicit drugs remain a serious threat to the health, safety, security, and financial well-being of Americans. The demand for illicit drugs, both in the United States and abroad, fuels the power, impunity, and violence of criminal organizations around the globe. Mexican DTOs are escalating their violence to consolidate their market share within the Western Hemisphere, protect their operations in Mexico, and expand their reach into the United States. In West Africa, Latin American cartels are exploiting local criminal organizations to move cocaine to Western Europe and the Middle East. There have also been instances of Afghan DTOs operating with those in West Africa to smuggle heroin to Europe and the United States. Many of the well-established organized criminal groups that had not been involved in drug trafficking—including those in Russia, China, Italy, and the Balkans—are now establishing ties to drug producers to develop their own distribution networks and markets. The expansion of drug trafficking is often accompanied by dramatic increases in local crime and corruption, as the United Nations has detected in regions such as West Africa and Central America.
Human Smuggling. Human smuggling is the facilitation, transportation, attempted transportation, or illegal entry of a person or persons across an international border, in violation of one or more coun­tries’ laws, either clandestinely or through deception, whether with the use of fraudulent documents or through the evasion of legitimate border controls. It is a criminal commercial transaction between willing parties who go their separate ways once they have procured illegal entry into a country. The vast majority of people who are assisted in illegally entering the United States and other countries are smuggled, rather than trafficked. International human smuggling networks are linked to other trans­national crimes including drug trafficking and the corruption of government officials. They can move criminals, fugitives, terrorists, and trafficking victims, as well as economic migrants. They undermine the sovereignty of nations and often endanger the lives of those being smuggled. In its 2010 report The Globalization of Crime: A Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that the smuggling of persons from Latin America to the United States generated approximately $6.6 billion annually in illicit proceeds for human smuggling networks.
Trafficking in Persons. Trafficking in Persons (TIP), or human trafficking, refers to activities involved when one person obtains or holds another person in compelled service, such as involuntary servitude, slavery, debt bondage, and forced labor. TIP specifically targets the trafficked person as an object of criminal exploitation—often for labor exploitation or sexual exploitation purposes—and trafficking victims are frequently physically and emotionally abused. Although TIP is generally thought of as an international crime that involves the crossing of borders, TIP victims can also be trafficked within their own countries. Traffickers can move victims between locations within the same country and often sell them to other trafficking organizations.
Weapons Trafficking. Criminal networks and illicit arms dealers also play important roles in the black markets from which terrorists and drug traffickers procure some of their weapons. As detailed in the 2010 UNODC report The Globalization of Crime, “The value of the documented global authorized trade in firearms has been estimated at approximately $1.58 billion in 2006, with unrecorded but licit transac­tions making up another $100 million or so. The most commonly cited estimate for the size of the illicit market is 10% - 20% of the licit market.” According to the head of UNODC, these “illicit arms fuel the violence that undermines security, development and justice” worldwide. U.S. Federal law enforcement agencies have intercepted large numbers of weapons or related items being smuggled to China, Russia, Mexico, the Philippines, Somalia, Turkmenistan, and Yemen in the last year alone.
Intellectual Property Theft. TOC networks are engaged in the theft of critical U.S. intellectual property, including through intrusions into corporate and proprietary computer networks. Theft of intellectual property ranges from movies, music, and video games to imitations of popular and trusted brand names, to proprietary designs of high-tech devices and manufacturing processes. This intellectual property theft causes significant business losses, erodes U.S. competitiveness in the world marketplace, and in many cases threatens public health and safety. Between FY 2003 and FY 2010, the yearly domestic value of customs seizures at U.S. port and mail facilities related to intellectual property right (IPR) violations leaped from $94 million to $188 million. Products originating in China accounted for 66% of these IPR seizures in FY 2010.
Cybercrime. TOC networks are increasingly involved in cybercrime, which costs consumers billions of dollars annually, threatens sensitive corporate and government computer networks, and under­mines worldwide confidence in the international financial system. Through cybercrime, transnational criminal organizations pose a significant threat to financial and trust systems—banking, stock markets, e-currency, and value and credit card services—on which the world economy depends. For example, some estimates indicate that online frauds perpetrated by Central European cybercrime networks have defrauded U.S. citizens or entities of approximately $1 billion in a single year. According to the U.S. Secret Service, which investigates cybercrimes through its 31 Electronic Crimes Task Forces, financial crimes facilitated by anonymous online criminal fora result in billions of dollars in losses to the Nation’s financial infrastructure. The National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), functions as a domestic focal point for 18 federal departments or agencies to coordinate, integrate, and share information related to cyber threat investigations, as well as make the Internet safer by pursuing terrorists, spies, and criminals who seek to exploit U.S. systems. Pervasive criminal activity in cyberspace not only directly affects its victims, but can imperil citizens’ and businesses’ faith in these digital systems, which are critical to our society and economy. Computers and the Internet play a role in most transnational crimes today, either as the target or the weapon used in the crime. The use of the Internet, personal computers, and mobile devices all create a trail of digital evidence. Often the proper investigation of this evidence trail requires highly trained personnel. Crimes can occur more quickly, but investigations proceed more slowly due to the critical shortage of investigators with the knowledge and expertise to analyze ever increasing amounts of potential digital evidence.
The Critical Role of Facilitators. Connecting these converging threats are “facilitators,” semi- legitimate players such as accountants, attorneys, notaries, bankers, and real estate brokers, who cross both the licit and illicit worlds and provide services to legitimate customers, criminals, and terrorists alike. The range of licit-illicit relationships is broad. At one end, criminals draw on the public reputations of licit actors to maintain facades of propriety for their operations. At the other end are “specialists” with skills or resources who have been completely subsumed into the criminal networks. For example, TOC networks rely on industry experts, both witting and unwitting, to facilitate corrupt transactions and to create the neces­sary infrastructure to pursue their illicit schemes, such as creating shell corporations, opening offshore bank accounts in the shell corporation’s name, and creating front businesses for their illegal activity and money laundering. Business owners or bankers are enlisted to launder money, and employees of legitimate companies are used to conceal smuggling operations. Human smugglers, human traffick­ers, arms traffickers, drug traffickers, terrorists, and other criminals depend on secure transportation networks and safe locations from which to stage smuggling activity or to store bulk cash or narcotics for transport. They also depend on fraudulently created or fraudulently obtained documents, such as passports and visas, to move themselves or their clients into the United States and illegally reside here.
Transnational criminal networks such as organized crime groups, drug traffickers, and weapons dealers at times share convergence points—places, businesses, or people—to “launder” or convert their illicit profits into legitimate funds. Many of these disparate networks also appear to use the same casinos, financial intermediaries, and front companies to plan arms and narcotics deals because they view them as safe intermediaries for doing business. Cash-intensive and high-volume businesses such as casinos are especially attractive, particularly those in jurisdictions that lack the political will and oversight to regulate casino operations or fail to perform due diligence on casino licensees. Illicit networks similarly abuse some of the same financial intermediaries and front companies in regions where government or law enforcement corruption is prevalent, with officials receiving either revenues from the criminal businesses or ownership stakes in the legitimate-appearing commercial entity.
Regional Priorities
TOC—a global problem—manifests itself in various regions in different ways.
Western Hemisphere: TOC networks—including transnational gangs—have expanded and matured, threatening the security of citizens and the stability of governments throughout the region, with direct security implications for the United States. Central America is a key area of converging threats where illicit trafficking in drugs, people, and weapons—as well as other revenue streams—fuel increased instability. Transnational crime and its accompanying violence are threatening the prosperity of some Central American states and can cost up to eight percent of their gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. The Government of Mexico is waging an historic campaign against transnational criminal organizations, many of which are expanding beyond drug trafficking into human smuggling and trafficking, weapons smuggling, bulk cash smuggling, extortion, and kidnapping for ransom. TOC in Mexico makes the U.S. border more vulnerable because it creates and maintains illicit corridors for border crossings that can be employed by other secondary criminal or terrorist actors or organizations. Farther south, Colombia has achieved remarkable success in reducing cocaine production and countering illegal armed groups, such as the FARC, that engage in TOC. Yet, with the decline of these organizations, new groups are emerging such as criminal bands known in Spanish as Bandas Criminales, or Bacrims.
Colombia: From Recipient to Provider of Assistance
After years of intensive capacity building assistance in Colombia, the United States is working to transfer financial and operational responsibility for institutional development to the Government of Colombia. Colombia now is an exporter of law enforcement and justice sector capabilities, providing assistance and advice for police, prosecutors, protection programs, and judiciary, criminal law, and procedure develop­ment. This reality is the result of the success of U.S. assistance in Colombian capacity building, a success the United States aims to replicate with other partner states. On July 2, 2008, the world witnessed the extraor­dinary courage and capability of Colombian forces during their daring rescue of 15 hostages—including 3 Americans—who had been held captive for years in the jungles by FARC guerrillas. The rescue was accom­plished without firing a shot.
Afghanistan/Southwest Asia: Nowhere is the convergence of transnational threats more apparent than in Afghanistan and Southwest Asia. The Taliban and other drug-funded terrorist groups threaten the efforts of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the United States, and other international partners to build a peace­ful and democratic future for that nation. The insurgency is seen in some areas of Afghanistan as criminally driven—as opposed to ideologically motivated—and in some areas, according to local Afghan officials and U.S. estimates, drug traffickers and the Taliban are becoming indistinguishable. In other instances, ideologically driven insurgent networks are either directly trafficking in narcotics or have linked up with DTOs to finance their criminal actions. The threatening crime-terror-insurgency nexus in this region is illustrated by cases such as that of INTERPOL fugitive Dawood Ibrahim, the reputed leader of South Asia’s power­ful “D Company.” He is wanted in connection with the 1993 Mumbai bombing and is sanctioned under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 (Taliban/al-Qa`ida).
Russia/Eurasia: Russian and Eurasian organized crime networks represent a significant threat to eco­nomic growth and democratic institutions. Russian organized crime syndicates and criminally linked oligarchs may attempt to collude with state or state-allied actors to undermine competition in strategic markets such as gas, oil, aluminum, and precious metals. At the same time, TOC networks in the region are establishing new ties to global drug trafficking networks. Nuclear material trafficking is an especially prominent concern in the former Soviet Union. The United States will continue to cooperate with Russia and the nations of the region to combat illicit drugs and TOC.
The Balkans: A traditional conduit for smuggling between east and west, the Balkans has become an ideal environment for the cultivation and expansion of TOC. Weak institutions in Albania, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina have enabled Balkan-based TOC groups to seize control of key drug and human trafficking routes and Western European markets. The Balkans region has become a new entry point for Latin American cocaine, a source of synthetic drugs, and a transit region for heroin chemical precursors for use in the Caucasus and Afghanistan. Excess weapons are smuggled to countries of concern. Insufficient border controls and the ease of acquiring passports enable the transit of criminals and terrorist figures to Western Europe. Cooperation between the United States and the European Union, as well as bilateral cooperation with the countries in the region to foster legal institution building, economic progress, and good governance in the Balkans will be key to eliminating the environment supporting TOC.
West Africa: West Africa has become a major transit point for illegal drug ship­ments to Europe and for Southwest Asian heroin to the United States. It has also become both a source of—and transit point for—methamphetamine destined for the Far East. West Africa also serves as a transit route for illicit proceeds flowing back to source countries. TOC exacerbates corruption and undermines the rule of law, democratic processes, and transparent business practices in several African states that already suffer from weak institutions. Due to its lack of law enforcement capabilities, its susceptibility to corruption, its porous borders, and its strategic location, Guinea-Bissau remains a significant hub of narcotics trafficking on the verge of developing into a narco-state. While many officials within the Government of Guinea-Bissau recognize the extent of the drug problem and express a willingness to address it, a crippling lack of resources and capacity remains a hindrance to real progress in combating drug trafficking. The recent re-appointment of U.S. Treasury-designated drug kingpin Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto as Naval Chief of Staff is likely to further entrench drug cartels in the permissive operating conditions prevailing in Guinea-Bissau. In the Gulf of Guinea, maritime criminals operate in areas of weak governance, kidnapping oil workers, stealing oil from pipelines, and causing environmental damage that harms the citizenry. The United States will work with African governments, European partners, and multilateral institutions to counter this threat to development, democratic processes, and the rule of law in the region.
Asia/Pacific: TOC networks and DTOs are integrating their activities in the Asia/Pacific region. Due to the region’s global economic ties, these criminal activities have serious implications worldwide. The economic importance of the region also heightens the threat posed to intellectual property rights, as a large portion of intellectual property theft originates from China and Southeast Asia. Human trafficking and smuggling remain significant concerns in the Asia/Pacific region, as demonstrated by the case of convicted alien smuggler Cheng Chui Ping, who smuggled more than 1,000 aliens into the United States during the course of her criminal career, sometimes hundreds at a time. TOC networks in the region are also active in the illegal drug trade, trafficking precursor chemicals for use in illicit drug production. North Korean government entities have likely maintained ties with established crime networks, including those that produce counterfeit U.S. currency, threatening the global integrity of the U.S. dollar. It is unclear whether these links persist. The United States will continue to improve its understanding of the TOC threats in the Asia/Pacific region and will work with partner nations to develop a comprehensive response.",Nuclear material trafficking is an especially prominent concern in the former Soviet Union.

Welcome to the specialized website of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation for obtaining e-visas.
Please read the following information carefully before completing the unified electronic visa (e-visa) application form.
Characteristics of the unified e-visa and conditions for its issuance
Only citizens of the following foreign countries, the list of which is approved by the Government of the Russian Federation, are eligible for the unified e-visa.
The unified e-visa is valid for the entry into and exit from the Russian Federation only through the following state border crossing points of the Russian Federation, the list of which is approved by the Government of the Russian Federation.
E-visa applicants are not required to submit an invitation letter, hotel booking confirmation or any other document confirming the purpose of their travel to the Russian Federation.
The unified e-visa entitles you to enter the Russian Federation and stay in the Russian Federation for private or business visit, tourism, as well as for participating in scientific, cultural, socio-political, economic, sporting events and carrying out relevant communications and contacts. If the purpose of your trip to the Russian Federation is none of the above, you have to apply to a diplomatic mission or consular post of the Russian Federation for a regular (not electronic) visa.
Foreign citizens arriving in the Russian Federation on the basis of a unified e-visa have the right to freedom of movement within the entire territory of the Russian Federation, except for visits to territories, organizations and facilities to which a special permit is required in accordance with federal laws.
The unified e-visa is a single entry visa. The validity period of a unified electronic visa is 60 days from the date of issue. The permitted period of stay in the Russian Federation on the basis of a unified e-visa within its validity period shall not exceed 16 days from the date of entry.
ATTENTION! The permitted period of stay in the Russian Federation on the basis of a unified e-visa of up to 16 days DOES NOT IMPLY the possibility of staying for 384 hours net time (24 hours x 16). The day of arrival and the day of departure are counted as two days. We recommend using the visa calculator to calculate the permitted period of stay.
The period of validity of an electronic visa and/or the permitted period of stay may be extended only in cases where it is impossible to leave the territory of the Russian Federation due to the need of emergency treatment or unsurmountable circumstances (force majeure) or natural disasters.
Extension of the e-visa and (or) the permitted period of stay is carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation or its territorial bodies at the place of migration registration of a foreign citizen at the place of stay, and if there is no migration registration at the place of stay – at the place of actual stay by way of issuing an ordinary (not electronic) visa.
If you have a valid Russian visa in your passport, you do not need to apply for a unified e-visa. You can visit the Russian Federation with a regular visa within its validity period without the restrictions established for the unified e-visa. The validity of a regular visa cannot be extended by obtaining an e-visa.
In order to apply for a unified e-visa, it is necessary to submit an application from your personal account on the specialized website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia or through the Russian Foreign Ministry mobile application. The application can be submitted no earlier than 40 days and no later than 4 days before the expected date of entry into the Russian Federation.
Before completing the unified e-visa application, you will need to give your consent to the automated processing, transmission and storage of the data in your application for the purposes of issuing a unified e-visa.
A fee is charged for processing an application for a unified e-visa. Payment can be made on the specialized website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia or through the Russian Foreign Ministry mobile application using Internet acquiring technology with bank cards of international payment systems (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) through the special website of the Russian Foreign Ministry or its mobile app using the Internet acquiring technology. The payment is non-refundable regardless of the result of the application processing. No consular fee is charged in case of e-visa applications for children under 6 years of age.
Applications for a unified e-visa will be processed in no more than 4 calendar days from the date of submission of the application. The date and time of the submission of the application shall be the date and time of sending the completed application for processing. In the case referred to in point 14, the date and time of the submission of the application shall be the date and time of sending the amended application for reprocessing. It takes no longer than 4 calendar days from the date of submission of the application for a unified e-visa for it to be processed. The date and time of sending the completed application for processing is considered the date and time of its submission. In the case referred to in point 14, the date and time of sending the amended application for reprocessing will be considered the date and time of its submission.
The processing of applications and the issuance of unified e-visas are carried out by diplomatic missions or consular posts of the Russian Federation as designated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. If the processing of the application reveals that any of the information stated therein is incorrect, it will be no longer processed and be returned to you for editing with the fields to be corrected being indicated and comments. An application shall be returned for editing no later than two calendar days from the date of submission of the application. Use your personal account to correct the application and submit it for reprocessing. Processing of the application shall only be resumed after the amended application has been submitted for reprocessing.
Indication of date, month and year of birth is mandatory when filling out the application form. If your full date of birth is not specified in your passport, the unified e-visa application cannot be accepted for processing.
Your passport must be machine-readable and issued by your country of nationality. Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of submitting the application for a unified e-visa. If your passport does not meet these requirements, the e-visa application cannot be accepted for processing. There must be sufficient space in your passport for border crossing stamps.
If you are travelling with minor children indicated in your passport, a separate application for a unified e-visa must be submitted for each child. All minor children travelling with their parents must have a separate e-visa.
The information you provide in your application must be complete and accurate. Any incorrect information may lead to the revocation of the already issued visa at the border crossing point of the Russian Federation or in the territory of the Russian Federation.
Foreign citizens staying in the Russian Federation on the basis of unified e-visas are required to have a medical insurance valid in the territory of the Russian Federation for the entire duration of their stay, with the exception of citizens of the following foreign countries who are exempt from this requirement on the basis of reciprocity.
A unified e-visa may be refused in cases established by the legislation of the Russian Federation.

Abstract
This article provides an overview of a sociological study of the views of 338 drug addiction treatment professionals. A comparison is drawn between the bioethical approaches of Russian and foreign experts from 18 countries. It is concluded that the bioethical priorities of Russian and foreign experts differ significantly. Differences involve attitudes toward confidentiality, informed consent, compulsory treatment, opioid agonist therapy, mandatory testing of students for psychoactive substances, the prevention of mental patients from having children, harm reduction programs (needle and syringe exchange), euthanasia, and abortion. It is proposed that the cardinal dissimilarity between models for providing drug treatment in the Russian Federation versus the majority of the countries of the world stems from differing bioethical attitudes among drug addiction treatment experts.

Introduction
Russian and international narcology (addiction medicine) began to develop along divergent paths during the second half of the twentieth century. Indeed, Russian narcology has ceased to be a part of international narcology. There are cardinal differences in current scientific views on the nature of dependency, its neurobiological or psychopathological bases, and on standards of therapy and how best to organize narcological care [1-9]. In 1976 Soviet narcology cut ""the umbilical cord"" connecting it with psychiatry and began to be seen as an independent discipline. No longer was it considered necessary for experts to seek an underlying psychiatric cause to addiction. In contrast, in the vast majority of countries, narcology evolved within the boundaries of psychiatry. There is evidence to suggest that a principal cause of the current differences between Russian and international narcology is the distance placed between Soviet narcology and psychiatry, a breach that paved the way toward repressive measures against patients.
In parallel with these trends in Russian narcology there has been a gradual assessment of bioethical and deontological norms [6,10]. Although there have been calls for adherence to the principles of medical ethics, the procedures put into practice continue to be incompatible with these principles. Drug addicts still have even fewer patient rights than the mentally ill. They have been exposed to discrimination and stigmatization both in society and within drug treatment facilities. They have quite often been perceived by physicians as deviants or criminals, since during the Soviet period they were subject to measures of compulsion, isolation and re-education.
Contemporary Russian narcology is one of the few medical specialities in which doctors' and health care workers' ethical and deontological priorities still guide the processes of diagnosis, therapy and rehabilitation [11]. It is not unusual for an adolescent who has been caught taking drugs to be forced to register with a narcology clinic and deprived of rights. The choice of what therapeutic or rehabilitative approach to use (including those that involve compulsion) is often made on the false premise that drug addiction is not a disease, but a form of deviant behavior. In spite of the fact that narcology has a psychiatric component, the standards of bioethics and medical law that are observed in psychiatry [12-17] are not always applied to it. The legitimacy and expediency of applying the norms dictated by the Russian Federation law ""Concerning Psychiatric Care and Guaranteeing Patient Rights"" [18] to drug addicts are still being debated today [19,20].
This can probably be seen as stemming from the very different attitudes doctors have toward mental illness and the disease of drug addiction and, as a consequence, toward observing standard bioethical principles. According to sociological research [5], a large number (almost half) of Russian psychiatrists working in the area of narcology unequivocally believe that drug dependence and alcoholism are not mental disorders or diseases but are rather caused by ""dissoluteness."" Probably for this reason 54.5% of experts in drug addiction treatment identify religion as ""the most effective method for treating drug addiction.""
The hypothesis underlying the present study is that Russian and foreign drug treatment professionals configure their bioethical priorities very differently. In this connection, its method applied a sociological approach to studying the specific attitudes held by Russian and foreign specialists working in drug treatment toward various actual questions of contemporary bioethics and medical law. Some of the questions had to do with contentious issues of bioethics in general and some were specific to psychiatry and narcology. Among the former were questions relating to euthanasia, abortions, gender reassignment operations, cloning, the use of placental stem cells, organ transplantation, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the responsibility of HIV+ patients for their own illness, and Harm Reduction programs (the exchange of needles and syringes, recommendations about condom use). Among the latter were questions connected with respondent attitudes toward compulsory treatment in narcology, compulsory (obligatory) testing of students and schoolchildren for the use of psychoactive substances, opioid substitution therapy, the permissibility of disclosing confidential information or infringing the principle of informed consent in psychiatry and narcology, and the permissibility of preventing the mentally ill from having children.
To carry out the study, a questionnaire consisting of 19 questions both a Russian and English version (I would like to express my gratitude to IHRD for help translating the questionnaire) was created. Research was conducted anonymously. The respondents were professionals actively engaged in providing narcological care (psychiatrists, experts in drug addiction treatment) who wished to take part in the study. (Under the circumstances, it was not deemed necessary to obtain informed consent.) Respondents were informed that ""Answers will be kept anonymous"" and were encouraged to be ""maximally candid"" in their answers. The questionnaire was sent via e-mail, and answers were also received via e-mail. Questionnaires were sent to narcological clinics and centers in various regions of Russia, departments of psychiatry, narcology, and psychotherapy in the country's medical universities, and also to addiction, psychiatric, and medical associations, university departments of psychiatry, and addiction treatment centers located in various countries. In total, more than 1000 questionnaires were distributed (700 across the Russian Federation and nearly 300 internationally). A total of 264 completed Russian-language questionnaires and 92 English-language questionnaires were returned by respondents to researchers. Completed questionnaires were received from 18 countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Great Britain, Vietnam, Germany, Israel, Italy, Canada, China, Latvia, Macedonia, the Netherlands, the United States, Thailand, France, Croatia, and Montenegro. All 246 Russian and 92 English questionnaires appeared to be correctly completed and were therefore submitted for statistical processing. The study sample consisted of 338 persons: 138 men (40.8%) and 200 women (59.2%). Tenure in the field ranged from 1 to 30 years. Results were accepted on a non-selective basis.

Survey findings indicate that attitudes toward the majority of bioethical questions (12 of 19) among Russian and foreign experts differ significantly. Despite the fact that respondents were in agreement in seeing ""drug addiction [as] an illness requiring medical treatment (like other illnesses),"" instead of ""a deviant behavior that requires rehabilitation,"" which would seem to suggest that they would also share attitudes toward the importance of observing principles of bioethics, this is not reflected in practice.
Significantly different attitudes on the part of Russian and foreign drug addiction treatment professionals toward bioethical problems confronted in narcology were identified in regard to: the need to observe confidentiality; informed consent; the permissibility of compulsory treatment; and substitution therapy. More than half (55.7%) of the Russian specialists surveyed as compared to 24% of foreign specialists (p < 0.01) felt that information about mentally ill patients and drug addicts could be given to law enforcement services ""in order to support safety in the community."" This suggests that one of the tendencies in Russian narcology is to permit infringement of the principle of confidentiality despite voicing support for it. According to a sociological study [19] that surveyed drug users, infringement of confidentiality in Russian narcology is more the rule than the exception."" One in three (34%) faced disclosure of a confidential diagnosis. Respondents believed that information about a diagnosis was most likely to be obtained by the police (52.5%) and relatives (49.8%), or, more rarely, by an educational institution (5.0%) and place of employment (4.5%). Last year, in various regions of the country, patients were systematically deprived of their driver's licences solely due to the fact that they were registered with a drug treatment clinic. In violation of bioethical principles, patient information had been handed over to agencies of law enforcement.
Similar ""bioethical nihilism"" was seen in respondent attitudes toward the necessity of observing the principle of ""informed consent,"" a topic that is still being debated. Real differences (p < 0.01) were seen between Russian and foreign addiction treatment professionals on this point. Among Russian specialists, 54.5% (in comparison with 30.4% from other countries) felt that exceptions can be made to the principle of informed consent in psychiatry or drug addiction treatment.""
The problem of putting the principle of ""informed consent"" into practice has to do with the fact that in the Russian Federation patients with alcohol or drug dependency, in the course of receiving medical narcological care, either are not given all the information necessary for responsible decision-making about the choice of therapy, or receive it in the distorted form. This has to do first and foremost with the practice of so-called ""coding,"" where the informed consent is constructed in such a way that the doctor misleads the patient about the essence (mechanisms) of the technique [4,7,11]. The patient is informed that ""a substance that blocks opioid receptors will be administered"" or ""brain activity related to the longing for psychoactive substances"" will be altered or there will be ""coding for a dose"" or ""the subconscious image of illness"" will be destroyed. Informed consent in such cases consists in the patient signing a paper confirming that if he willfully violates the regimen by using drugs or alcohol, he risks seriously damage to his health and even death. For ethical reasons and due to its unscientific nature, this technique is prohibited within the international narcological community.
The question of compulsory treatment in narcology also falls within the purview of bioethics and is a focus of attention within the scientific community, which views it in terms of one of the fundamental principles of modern bioethics - the autonomy principle [10,21-23]. World Health Organization recommendations devoted to treating drug addition [24] emphasize that ""In line with the principle of autonomy, patients should be free to choose whether to participate in treatment."" The guidelines go on to state that ""In situations where opioid-dependent individuals are convicted of crimes related to their opioid use, they may be offered treatment for their opioid dependence as an alternative to a penal sanction,"" however, ""Such treatment would not be considered compulsory.""
Survey results showed significant differences (p < 0.001) between attitudes toward compulsory treatment of drug addicts held by Russian and foreign narcology professionals, with 62.6% and 28.3% respectively supporting this practice.
The problem of opioid substitution therapy (OST) [11,16,25-27], which is covered by WHO treatment standards, has emerged in recent years as a new question for bioethics and medical law. According to opponents of OST [3,25], a number of cardinal ethical problems place it beyond the bounds of morality. This has primarily to do with the idea that it is unethical to ""treat an illness (drug addiction), knowing that it will continue."" Secondly, there is the question of the ethical permissibility of ""offering someone one drug to help him stop taking others so that he will became less dangerous to those around him."" Thirdly, there is the fact that the ideology of harm reduction programs"" (including, OST) espouses a ""'more respectful' attitude toward addicts than any medical approach."" Supporters of OST argue that this approach promotes such humane goals as improving the patient's ""quality of life"" and reduces the risk osf overdose, suicidal behavior, mortality, criminal and risky behavior, and so forth. Surely such considerations are not irrelevant to biomedical ethics. Indeed, it could be argued that depriving patients of access to OST is a violation of bioethical principles.
The study showed Russian and foreign experts in drug addiction treatment differing considerably when it came to OST as well (p < 0,001). The overwhelming majority of non-Russian experts (93.5%) support OST as opposed to barely half (51.2%) of Russians working in the field.
It can thus be presumed that the medical community's particular attitudes toward the problems of narcology described above are conditioned by a sense of civic duty that has taken shape along with the suppression of biomedical ethics and concepts of humanism, justice and the wellbeing of the patient.
It is shocking to compare respondent answers to the question about forbidding mentally ill women from having children and the possibility of forcing them to submit to sterilization. Among Russian experts, 40.6% felt these practices were permissible compared to 10.9% of foreign experts (p < 0.001). It is worth noting that this aspect of medical ethics has long since been unequivocally resolved, although this is not reflected in the responses by the Russian narcology professionals.
In addition to the attitudinal differences relating to bioethical problems specific to narcology, the study revealed differences in other areas of bioethics as well. For example, results indicate substantial differences (p < 0.01) in attitudes toward euthanasia - one of the controversial questions facing contemporary bioethics [28-31]. Foreign experts were one-and-a-half times more likely to support euthanasia (69.6% versus 41.5%). It is also interesting to correlate attitudes toward euthanasia with attitudes toward specifically narcology-related bioethical problems. In the Russian sample, attitudes toward euthanasia had the strongest correlation with attitudes toward OST, a connection not seen in the sample of foreign experts, whose responses on this subject strongly negatively correlated with attitudes toward the principles of confidentiality and ""informed consent.""
Significant differences between the samples were also seen in attitudes toward the permissibility of terminating pregnancy through abortions (p < 0.01), with 95.7% of foreign professionals supporting permissibility versus 77.7% of Russians, and toward compulsory drug testing of students and schoolchildren (p < 0.001), with 47.2% of Russian and 19.6% of foreign respondents expressing support. There were also differences among respondents (p < 0.05) in attitudes toward preventing the transmission of HIV among drug users by providing access to needle and syringe exchange (87% of foreigners favored this practice versus 73.5% of Russian respondents), toward the need to expand access to narcotic analgesics to cancer patients with pain syndrome (97.8% of foreign respondents were in favor versus 87% of Russian ones), and toward sex change operations (76.1% of foreign respondents were in favor versus 61% of Russian ones).

Conclusions
This survey of bioethical attitudes among Russian and foreign drug addiction treatment professionals points to significant differences both in regard to bioethical questions specific to narcology and most general questions confronting bioethics. It can be assumed that the cardinal differences between the models for providing narcological care in the Russian Federation and in the majority of other countries of the world (based on the WHO principle) is largely a function of differences in the bioethical attitudes among narcology professionals revealed in this study.
Russian narcology developed as a part of what was known as ""punitive Soviet psychiatry,"" within which psychiatric practice was used for political purposes and patient rights were frequently violated. Furthermore, a large number of doctors specializing in the field of narcology had no training in psychiatry. The 1992 law, ""Concerning Psychiatric Care and Guaranteeing Patient Rights,"" enabled the introduction of positive and fundamental change within psychiatry - patient rights were guaranteed and adherence to ethical norms became standard practice. This law, however, was not applied to the practice of narcology. Those afflicted with drug addiction and alcoholism continue to be deprived of the right to humane treatment, legal protection, and confidentiality. Doctors working in narcology in isolation from the psychiatric community continue to favor coercive measures toward patients. This appears to be why their bioethical views differ so much from those of their international colleagues.

When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ukraine had the world’s third largest nuclear arsenal on its territory. When Ukrainian-Russian negotiations on removing these weapons from Ukraine appeared to break down in September 1993, the U.S. government engaged in a trilateral process with Ukraine and Russia. The result was the Trilateral Statement, signed in January 1994, under which Ukraine agreed to transfer the nuclear warheads to Russia for elimination. In return, Ukraine received security assurances from the United States, Russia and Britain; compensation for the economic value of the highly-enriched uranium in the warheads (which could be blended down and converted into fuel for nuclear reactors); and assistance from the United States in dismantling the missiles, missile silos, bombers and nuclear infrastructure on its territory. Steven Pifer recounts the history of this unique negotiation and describes the key lessons learned.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Trilateral Process
The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left Soviet strategic nuclear weapons—both strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems—located on the territory of four newly independent states: Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine. Soviet tactical nuclear weapons were even more widely scattered.  Moscow quickly secured the return of all tactical nuclear warheads to Russia during the first half of 1992.  Moscow also in relatively short order reached bilateral understandings with Belarus and Kazakhstan on the removal or elimination of the strategic nuclear weapon systems on the territory of those countries.
The process with Ukraine proved more difficult, as Kyiv sought to achieve particular objectives before giving up what was then the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world. Among other things, the Ukrainian government wanted acceptable answers to four key questions:
Possession of nuclear weapons was seen to confer certain security benefits; what guarantees or assurances would there be for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity after it gave up strategic nuclear arms?
  The strategic nuclear warheads had commercial value in the form of the highly-enriched uranium (HEU) they contained, which could be blended down into low-enriched uranium (LEU) and used in fuel rods for nuclear power reactors; how would Ukraine ensure that it received the value of the HEU in the nuclear warheads on its territory?
  Eliminating the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), ICBM silos, strategic bombers and nuclear infrastructure in Ukraine would be an expensive proposition at a time when the new Ukrainian economy was sharply contracting; who would cover the costs of those eliminations?
  How, where and under what conditions would the strategic nuclear warheads, ICBMs and bombers be eliminated?
Bilateral Ukrainian-Russian negotiations grappled with these issues in the months after the fall of the Soviet Union. They began to identify solutions to some questions but never successfully came to closure. The September 1993 Massandra summit between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Russian President Boris Yeltsin initially appeared to have achieved a formula for the transfer of the strategic nuclear warheads to Russia and the resolution of all ancillary issues. The bilateral deal, however, collapsed almost immediately.
Getting the nuclear weapons out of Ukraine topped the U.S. agenda with that country in its first years of independence. Washington wanted the nuclear warheads transferred to Russia but was sympathetic to some of the Ukrainian government’s concerns and actively discussed the issue—and related questions such as compensation and security assurances—separately with both sides from early 1992 on. The first trilateral meeting of American, Russian and Ukrainian diplomats took place in August 1993. Originally agnostic as to how the question would be resolved—as the result of a bilateral Ukrainian-Russian negotiation or of a process involving the United States—Washington concluded in the aftermath of the Massandra summit that it would have to become more directly involved in brokering a solution.  Both the Russians and Ukrainians welcomed U.S. participation, the Russians because they understood that Washington shared their goal of getting the nuclear weapons out of Ukraine, the Ukrainians because they believed that, with American officials engaged in the process, they would have a friend in court and could achieve a deal that better answered their four key questions.
The trilateral discussions accelerated in December, producing the Trilateral Statement and accompanying annex, signed by Kravchuk, Yelstin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow on January 14, 1994. Those documents provided that Ukraine would transfer all strategic warheads on its territory to Russia for elimination and, in return, would receive security assurances, compensation for the commercial value of the HEU, and Nunn-Lugar assistance to help with the disposal of ICBMs, ICBM silos, bombers and other infrastructure on Ukrainian territory. Perhaps as importantly but less tangibly, the Trilateral Statement removed what would have been a major impediment to Ukraine’s development of normal relations with the United States and the West.
The final act of the trilateral process played out in autumn 1994, with Ukraine’s accession to the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapons state. Clinton, Yeltsin and newly-elected Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma met on December 5 in Budapest on the margins of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe summit. Kuchma transmitted Ukraine’s instrument of accession to the NPT, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) entered into force, and the United States and Russia, joined by the United Kingdom, extended security assurances to Ukraine in what became known as the Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances.
Lessons Learned
After the Trilateral Statement and Budapest Memorandum were signed, implementation proceeded relatively smoothly. By June 1, 1996, Ukraine had transferred the last of the nuclear warheads on its territory to Russia for elimination, and the last START I-accountable strategic nuclear delivery vehicle, an SS-24 missile silo, was eliminated in 2001. More broadly, Ukraine’s denuclearization opened the way to an expanded U.S-Ukrainian bilateral relationship. Among other things, by the end of the 1990s, Ukraine was among the top recipients in the world of U.S. assistance. Denuclearization also removed what would have been a major impediment to Ukraine’s development of relations with Europe. In 1997, NATO and Ukraine agreed to a “distinctive partnership” and established the NATO-Ukraine Council.
Several factors explain the success of the trilateral process. They include: 

The ability to find a solution that met the interests of all parties. 
The trilateral process succeeded because it found a “win-win-win” solution that met the minimum requirements of all three participants. The minimum requirements for Russia and the United States were that Ukraine transfer or eliminate the strategic offensive arms, including the strategic warheads, on its territory. While Washington shared Moscow’s minimum requirements, it also wanted to resolve the nuclear issue so that it could move to a regular relationship with Ukraine. For Ukraine, the minimum requirement was good answers to questions regarding security assurances for Ukraine, compensation for the economic value of the HEU in the nuclear warheads, assistance for eliminating the nuclear legacy on Ukrainian territory, and conditions for the elimination of the strategic missiles, bombers and warheads. The sides’ minimum requirements allowed space for a solution acceptable to all, and Kyiv concluded that 1994 was the right time to cash in its nuclear chip. U.S. engagement made that easier for Kyiv by helping to rectify an inherent imbalance between Ukraine and Russia.

The importance of “doing what works.” 
The trilateral process succeeded because the sides were prepared to look for practical solutions and “do what worked.” On issues ranging from security assurances, to dealing with troublesome language in resolutions passed by the Rada (Ukraine’s parliament), to the need to keep some commitments in private channels, the sides found practical solutions.

The value of using events and presidential involvement to drive the process. U.S. officials used high-level meetings—including the possibility of expanding the January 1994 Clinton-Yeltsin meeting to include a trilateral session with Kravchuk and later the December 1994 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe summit in Budapest—to drive the trilateral process. Once these dates were fixed on presidential calendars, deadlines were established that forced the bureaucracies of all three countries to work harder and faster than they would have otherwise.

The value of money in easing solutions. The U.S. ability to commit resources at key points facilitated moving the process along, including using Nunn-Lugar monies to fund the elimination of strategic offensive arms in Ukraine and to “jump start” the process of Russia providing fuel rods for nuclear reactors to compensate Ukraine for the value of the HEU in transferred nuclear warheads.

The importance of understanding the other side’s needs. Understanding the other side’s needs and its internal political dynamics was critical to devising proposals that would yield a solution acceptable to all three parties. Both Washington and Moscow might have done better in this regard, especially during 1992 and 1993. For example, by focusing so heavily on nuclear weapons in the first two years of its relations with independent Ukraine, Washington failed to create confidence in Kyiv that there would be a robust Ukrainian-American relationship once the nuclear weapons issue was resolved. The initial U.S. fixation on nuclear weapons may well have had the unintended effect of increasing their value as a political bargaining chip in the minds of some Ukrainians.
These lessons may be applicable in other cases. Were North Korea or Iran to move away from their maximalist positions on nuclear weapons and open up some bargaining space, these lessons could prove useful in the Six-Party Talks and P-5 Plus One processes regarding those countries’ nuclear weapons programs. The circumstances that produced a successful trilateral process in 1993-94, however, were in certain ways unique, in particular in terms of the readiness of the Ukrainian and Russian governments to accept the United States as a participant. In the end, the three sides’ interests sufficiently coincided to produce a diplomatic success.

In Speech, Hatch Pushes for Swift Action on Job-Creating Trade Pact With Colombia
Utah Senator Says Congressional Action on Bilateral Agreement Should Not Be Linked to Nonrelated Issues
WASHINGTON – In a speech on the Senate floor today, U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, said it is imperative the U.S.- Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (CTPA) swiftly move through Congress free of any obstacles or linkage to other unresolved issues.
Hatch’s remarks come on the heels of a Committee hearing examining the bilateral trade pact where Administration officials signaled their interest in attaching non-related trade issues, such as the extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for Russia to the passage of CTPA.
Below are excerpts of Hatch’s speech:
ON LINKING TAA & PNTR TO CTPA Passage:
“It is time for the excuses to end.  Resolution of unrelated issues like Trade Adjustment Assistance and PNTR for Russia should not be used as further barriers to submission of this agreement.  Colombia is taking the steps laid out by the Obama Administration that the Administration has said are necessary before the President will formally submit the agreement to Congress.  Once those steps are taken in June, I fully expect the Administration to finally fulfill its end of the bargain and formally submit the agreement for Congressional approval without further conditions.  If not, the Administration is making a conscious decision to continue denying U.S. exporters improved access to the Colombian market, and to undermine our standing as a credible ally in Latin America.”  
ON THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DITHERING ON SUBMITTING CTPA TO CONGRESS:
“The Obama Administration’s delay in submitting the Colombia agreement is hurting U.S. exporters.  This failure is a drag on job creation and economic growth.  While the President has dithered as to whether to implement the trade agreement with Colombia, our trade competitors have been more than willing to enter into agreements with Colombia.  Consequently, while Colombia’s tariffs on U.S. imports have remained in place, Colombia’s tariffs on products from other countries are falling away.  For example, Colombia has implemented a preferential trade agreement with Argentina and Brazil.  As a result, U.S. farm products are rapidly being displaced in the Colombian market by products from those countries.  So it’s not too surprising that between 2007 and 2010 U.S. agricultural exports to Colombia fell by more than half.”
 
ON THE ADMINISTRATION’S LABOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH COLOMBIA:
“So, the Obama Administration has now negotiated an action plan that addresses its concerns regarding the labor situation in Colombia.  You would think we would have clarity that, once the steps in the action plan are fulfilled, the Administration would submit the agreement to Congress for its consideration.  But we do not have this clarity.  There has been no clear answer to this very simple question.”

Below is the text of Hatch’s full speech delivered on the Senate floor this afternoon:
Mr. / Mdme. President, yesterday the Finance Committee held a hearing on the U.S.  –  Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement.  This agreement will provide significant new opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, agricultural producers, and service providers in the rapidly growing Colombian market. 
Implementation of the Colombia agreement would also benefit U.S. national security.  Colombia is emerging from decades of civil strife, and it is in our interests to see that Colombia continues to heal from its wounds of the past.  The free trade agreement will help bring further stability to Colombia, a close friend and ally, while also opening and further building the market for U.S. exports to that country.  In short, it is a good agreement for the United States. 
So what’s the holdup?
Over four years have passed since the U.S. – Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement was signed.  It is imperative that the Administration submits an implementing bill for this agreement to Congress, and soon. The Administration, however, still won’t say when it will send an implementing bill to Capitol Hill. 
During yesterday’s hearing, I asked our Deputy U.S. Trade Representative two very simple questions regarding this issue.  First, assuming that Colombia fulfills the steps outlined in the Labor Action Plan developed by the Obama Administration and the Colombian government, will the Administration submit the Colombia agreement to Congress for a vote?  Second, is the Administration preconditioning the President’s formal submission of the Colombia Trade Agreement on matters not related to the action plan, such as Congressional extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance or Permanent Normal Trade Relations for Russia?
To me, these questions are pretty clear and can be answered with a simple yes or no.  But unfortunately, we did not get a clear answer.  After years of delay we still do not know if the Administration will ever submit the Colombia agreement to Congress for approval.  This is very unfortunate.
The Obama Administration’s delay in submitting the Colombia agreement is hurting U.S. exporters.  This failure is a drag on job creation and economic growth.  While the President has dithered as to whether to implement the trade agreement with Colombia, our trade competitors have been more than willing to enter into agreements with Colombia.  Consequently, while Colombia’s tariffs on U.S. imports have remained in place, Colombia’s tariffs on products from other countries are falling away.  For example, Colombia has implemented a preferential trade agreement with Argentina and Brazil.  As a result, U.S. farm products are rapidly being displaced in the Colombian market by products from those countries.  So it’s not too surprising that between 2007 and 2010 U.S. agricultural exports to Colombia fell by more than half. 
And it looks like matters will get even worse.  A Montana wheat grower who testified at yesterday’s hearing noted that the U.S. share of Colombia’s wheat market fell from 73 percent in 2008 to 43 percent in 2010.  He also stated that following implementation of the Canada – Colombia free trade agreement, which is expected to occur this year, U.S. exports of wheat to Colombia will drop to zero unless the United States implements its trade agreement with Colombia.
       
So U.S. agricultural exports to Colombia are already falling.  U.S. manufactured goods and U.S. services will be next. 
It doesn’t have to be this way.  We don’t have to continue giving away the growing Colombian market to our competitors.  If we want to boost our exports to Colombia, all we have to do is implement the U.S. – Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. 
The Obama Administration had earlier stated that it wanted to address Colombia’s internal labor situation before moving ahead with the agreement.  But the Administration delayed taking any meaningful steps to address their concerns with the Colombia government for years.  Just a few months ago the Administration finally got serious about engaging with Colombia.  And, low and behold, in a matter of weeks they were able to develop a Labor Action Plan that addressed their concerns in a meaningful and concrete way.  The Administration discovered that, in their own words they had a willing partner in Colombia.  The fact of the matter is that Colombia has been taking steps for years to address issues related to violence against unionists and has always been willing to do more.  Why it took the Administration so long to figure it out is a mystery to me.
So, the Obama Administration has now negotiated an action plan that addresses its concerns regarding the labor situation in Colombia.  You would think we would have clarity that, once the steps in the action plan are fulfilled, the Administration would submit the agreement to Congress for its consideration.  But we do not have this clarity.  There has been no clear answer to this very simple question.
Instead, there seem to be more preconditions on submitting the agreement that are not even related to the agreement itself, such as extension of trade adjustment assistance and permanent normal trade relations for Russia. 
This is very odd.  Most economists would agree that there are likely to be very few workers who will lose their jobs because of implementation of the Colombia trade agreement.  After all, the U.S. – Colombia trade agreement will result in almost no growth in imports from Colombia.  This is the case as almost all Colombian products have entered the United States duty-free over the past two decades on account of U.S. trade preference programs.  In contrast, Colombia’s average applied tariff on U.S. imports is over 12 percent, and they can reach as high as 388 percent. 
Moreover, the administration itself testified that implementation of the Colombia agreement: will expand exports of U.S. goods to Colombia by more than a billion dollars; increase U.S. GDP by $2.5 billion; and support thousands of additional jobs for our workers. So, it is hard to see further extension of the TAA program as a necessary precondition for approval of an agreement that will help our economy and support jobs in the United States.
I am also bewildered by any attempts to precondition submission of the Colombia agreement to congressional support for Permanent Normal Trade Relations for Russia.  These two issues are totally unrelated.  Given the current disregard for the rule of law and the many trade problems that persist in Russia today, it is hard to argue that the time is ripe for Congress to grant Russia permanent normal trade relations. 
Moreover, it would be particularly ironic, and sad, to condition passage of the Colombia trade agreement with permanent normal trade relations for Russia.  Over the past four years, Colombia has been a reliable U.S. trading partner, ready and willing to remove its tariffs on U.S. imports through implementation of our trade agreement.  During these same years, Russia has seemingly gone out of its way on numerous occasions to prove to the United States that it is an unreliable trading partner. 
It is fundamentally unfair to continue to treat a friend and ally like Colombia in this way.  Unfortunately, it is not the first time Democratic leaders have put one of our closest Latin American allies in this position.  The U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement was first signed on November 22, 2006.  Democratic leaders refused to consider the agreement until their additional demands were met on labor, the environment and intellectual property.  The Bush Administration responded by working with then Speaker Pelosi on a package of changes that were understood would lead to consideration of the agreement.  But once they had these changes in hand, the Democratic leadership in the House balked, citing yet more issues that had to be resolved.  When President Bush submitted the Colombia agreement  to Congress for its consideration utilizing Trade Promotion Authority procedures in April 2008, the Democratic leadership refused to allow the agreement to come up for a vote. Instead, they changed the rules, and the agreement has since languished for years.
It is time for the excuses to end.  Resolution of unrelated issues like Trade Adjustment Assistance and PNTR for Russia should not be used as further barriers to submission of this agreement.  Colombia is taking the steps laid out by the Obama Administration that the Administration has said are necessary before the President will formally submit the agreement to Congress.  Once those steps are taken in June, I fully expect the Administration to finally fulfill its end of the bargain and formally submit the agreement for Congressional approval without further conditions.  If not, the Administration is making a conscious decision to continue denying U.S. exporters improved access to the Colombian market, and to undermine our standing as a credible ally in Latin America.

The New START Treaty: Signed
FEBRUARY 2, 2011 AT 2:26 PM ET BY JESSE LEE
TWITTER FACEBOOK EMAIL 
Summary: The President signs a landmark nuclear arms treaty with Russia, New START, which will advance our security, our relations with Russia, and our progress toward a world not imperiled by nuclear weapons.
President Barack Obama signs the instrument of ratification of the New START Treaty in the Oval Office, Feb. 2, 2011. Participants include, from left: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen; Energy Secretary Steven Chu; Defense Secretary Robert Gates; Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.; Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.; Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; and Vice President Joe Biden.

Today the President ratified a landmark nuclear arms treaty with Russia, New START.  As the President said during the end of the last Congress, the treaty is ""a national security imperative"" as well as ""a cornerstone of our relations with Russia"" as we continue to work with them on everything from Iran to Afghanistan.  With the Senate having approved the treaty with a strong bipartisan vote late last year, today's signing marks a final step in the process.  That process began when President Obama and President Medvedev initially signed the agreement in Prague last April, a fitting location given that one year before that President Obama had been there for a major speech commiting to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.
You can read the Treaty (pdf) and Protocol (pdf) themselves, but here's a quick overview from our fact sheet at the time:
Strategic Offensive Reductions:  Under the Treaty, the U.S. and Russia will be limited to significantly fewer strategic arms within seven years from the date the Treaty enters into force.  Each Party has the flexibility to determine for itself the structure of its strategic forces within the aggregate limits of the Treaty.  These limits are based on a rigorous analysis conducted by Department of Defense planners in support of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review. 
Aggregate limits:
1,550 warheads.  Warheads on deployed ICBMs and deployed SLBMs count toward this limit and each deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments counts as one warhead toward this limit.
This limit is 74% lower than the limit of the 1991 START Treaty and 30% lower than the deployed strategic warhead limit of the 2002 Moscow Treaty. 
A combined limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments.
A separate limit of 700 deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments.
This limit is less than half the corresponding strategic nuclear delivery vehicle limit of the START Treaty.
Verification and Transparency:  The Treaty has a verification regime that combines the appropriate elements of the 1991 START Treaty with new elements tailored to the limitations of the Treaty.  Measures under the Treaty include on-site inspections and exhibitions, data exchanges and notifications related to strategic offensive arms and facilities covered by the Treaty, and provisions to facilitate the use of national technical means for treaty monitoring.   To increase confidence and transparency, the Treaty also provides for the exchange of telemetry.
Treaty Terms:  The Treaty’s duration will be ten years, unless superseded by a subsequent agreement.   The Parties may agree to extend the Treaty for a period of no more than five years.  The Treaty includes a withdrawal clause that is standard in arms control agreements.  The 2002 Moscow Treaty terminates upon entry into force of the New START Treaty.  The U.S. Senate and the Russian legislature must approve the Treaty before it can enter into force.
No Constraints on Missile Defense and Conventional Strike:  The Treaty does not contain any constraints on testing, development or deployment of current or planned U.S. missile defense programs or current or planned United States long-range conventional strike capabilities.

JFK IN HISTORY
THE COLD WAR IN BERLIN
Two years after the construction of the Berlin Wall, President Kennedy paid a historic visit to Berlin to challenge Soviet oppression and offer hope to the people of the divided city.
At the end of World War II, the main Allied powers—the United States, France, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union—divided Germany into two zones.
The Soviet Union occupied East Germany and installed a rigidly controlled communist state. The other three Allies shared the occupation of West Germany and helped rebuild the country as a capitalist democracy. The City of Berlin, located 200 miles inside East Germany, was also divided. Half of the city—West Berlin—was actually part of West Germany.
Many East Germans did not want to live in a communist country and crossed into West Berlin, where they could either settle or find transportation to West Germany and beyond. By 1961, four million East Germans had moved west. This exodus illustrated East Germans' dissatisfaction with their way of life, and posed an economic threat as well, since East Germany was losing its workers.
A Summit with the Soviets
In June 1961, President John F. Kennedy traveled to Vienna, Austria, for a summit with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Not only was the summit unsuccessful in its goal of building trust, but it also increased tensions between the two superpowers—particularly in discussions regarding the divided city of Berlin.
During the summit, Khrushchev threatened to cut off Allied access to West Berlin. Kennedy was startled by Khrushchev's combative style and tone and unsettled by the threat. In an address to the American people on July 25, President Kennedy announced that the United States might need to defend its rights in Berlin militarily:
So long as the communists insist that they are preparing to end by themselves unilaterally our rights in West Berlin and our commitments to its people, we must be prepared to defend those rights and those commitments. We will at times be ready to talk, if talk will help. But we must also be ready to resist with force, if force is used upon us. Either alone would fail. Together, they can serve the cause of freedom and peace.
President Kennedy ordered substantial increases in American intercontinental ballistic missile forces, added five new army divisions, and increased the nation's air power and military reserves.
The Berlin Wall
In the early morning hours of August 13, 1961, the people of East Berlin were awakened by the rumbling of heavy machinery barreling down their streets toward the line that divided the eastern and western parts of the city.
Groggy citizens looked on as work details began digging holes and jackhammering sidewalks, clearing the way for the barbed wire that would eventually be strung across the dividing line. Armed troops manned the crossing points between the two sides and, by morning, a ring of Soviet troops surrounded the city. Overnight, the freedom to pass between the two sections of Berlin ended.
Running across cemeteries and along canals, zigzagging through the city streets, the Berlin Wall was a chilling symbol of the Iron Curtain that divided all of Europe between communism and democracy. Berlin was at the heart of the Cold War.
In 1962, the Soviets and East Germans added a second barrier, about 100 yards behind the original wall, creating a tightly policed no man's land between the walls. After the wall went up, more than 260 people died attempting to flee to the West.
Though Kennedy chose not to challenge directly the Soviet Union's building of the Berlin Wall, he reluctantly resumed testing nuclear weapons in early 1962, following the lead of the Soviet Union.
""Let Them Come to Berlin""
In the summer of 1963, President Kennedy visited Berlin and was greeted by ecstatic crowds who showered his entourage with flowers, rice, and torn paper. In the Rudolph Wilde Platz, Kennedy gave one of his most memorable speeches to a rapt audience.

There are many people in the world who really don't understand, or say they don't, what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world. Let them come to Berlin. There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to Berlin. And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work with the Communists. Let them come to Berlin. And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Lass'sie nach Berlin kommen. Let them come to Berlin.
No other American politician had met with such joy and enthusiasm on a visit to Germany. Shortly after President Kennedy's death in November of 1963, the square where he had made his famous speech was renamed the John F. Kennedy Platz.

and in
either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are by the first-mentioned State claimed to be profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State may make appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits, where that other State considers the adjustment justified. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.
Article 10
DIVIDENDS
1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.
2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the dividends.
3. The term ""dividends"" as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.
Article 11
INTEREST
1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.
2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

a) the interest is beneficially owned by a Contracting State, a regional or local authority thereof or by an instrumentality of that State which is not subject to tax therein;
b) the interest is beneficially owned by:
the Central Bank of Norway, the Norwegian Guarantee Institute for Export Credits, A/S Eksportfinans;

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a regional or local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.
4. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a regional or local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
5. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State; due regard being had to the other provisions of the Convention.

3. Gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to such operation shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the profits of the enterprise are taxable according to Article 8 of this Convention.
4. Gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods or merchandise shall be taxable only in that Contracting State, except insofar as those containers or trailers and related equipment are used for transport solely between places within the other Contracting State.
5. Gains derived by an individual of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or the other corporate rights in an entity which is a resident of the other Contracting State, and gains from the alienation of any other security which are subjected in that other State to the same taxation treatment as gains from the alienation of such shares or other rights may be taxed in that other Contracting State, but only if:

Article 23
ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION
In Norway double taxation shall be avoided as follows:
Subject to the provisions of the laws of Norway regarding the allowance as a credit against Norwegian tax of tax payable in a territory outside Norway (which shall not affect the general principle hereof) -
Where a resident of Norway derives income or owns elements of capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Russia, Norway shall allow:
a) as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the income tax paid in Russia;
b) as a deduction from the tax on the capital of that resident, an amount equal to the capital tax paid in Russia on the elements of capital.
Such deduction in either case shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax or capital tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable, as the case may be, to the income or the same elements of capital which may be taxed in Russia.
Where in accordance with any provision of the Convention income derived or capital owned by a resident of Norway is exempt from tax in Norway, Norway may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital.
In Russia double taxation shall be avoided as follows:
Where a resident of Russia derives income from Norway, which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in Norway, the amount of tax on that income payable in Norway, may be credited against the tax levied in Russia. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the tax of Russia on that income computed in accordance with its taxation laws and regulations.
Article 24
NON-DISCRIMINATION
1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.
2. Stateless persons who are residents of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome that the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected.
3. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.
4. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11 or paragraph 4 of Article 12 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.
5. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.
Article 25
MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE
1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the receipt of the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.
2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.
3. The competent authorities of the Contracting State shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.
4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

Article 26
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention and of the domestic laws of the Contracting States concerning taxes established by the Contracting States insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention.

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;
b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;
c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).
Article 27
ASSISTANCE IN COLLECTION
1. The Contracting States undertake to lend assistance to each other in the collection of the taxes owed by a taxpayer to the extent that the amount thereof has been finally determined according to the laws of the Contracting State making the request for assistance.
2. In the case of a request by a Contracting State for the collection of taxes which has been accepted for collection by the other Contracting State, such taxes shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the laws applicable to the collection of its own taxes and as if the taxes to be so collected were its own taxes.
3. Any request for collection by a Contracting State shall be accompanied by such certificate as is required by the laws of that State to establish that the taxes owed by the taxpayer have been finally determined.
4.

5. A request under paragraphs 3 or 4 shall only be made by a Contracting State to the extent that sufficient property of the taxpayer owing the taxes is not available in that State for recovery of the taxes owed.
6. The Contracting State in which tax is recovered in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall forthwith remit to the Contracting State on behalf of which the tax was collected the amount so recovered minus, where appropriate, the amount of extraordinary costs referred to in subparagraph 7 b).
7. It is understood that unless otherwise agreed by the competent authorities of both Contracting States:
a) ordinary costs incurred by a Contracting State in providing assistance shall be borne by that State;
b) extraordinary costs incurred by a Contracting State in providing assistance shall be borne by the other State and shall be payable regardless of the amount collected on its behalf by that other State.
As soon as a Contracting State anticipates that extraordinary cost may be incurred, it shall so advise the other Contracting State and indicate the estimated amount of such costs.
8. In this Article, the term ""taxes"" means the taxes to which the Convention applies and includes any interest and penalties relating thereto.

What is taeniasis?
Taeniasis in humans is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm species Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), and Taenia asiatica (Asian tapeworm). Humans can become infected with these tapeworms by eating raw or undercooked beef (T. saginata) or pork (T. solium and T. asiatica). People with taeniasis may not know they have a tapeworm infection because symptoms are usually mild or nonexistent.
T. solium tapeworm infections can lead to cysticercosis, which is a disease that can cause seizures, so it is important seek treatment.
More on: cysticercosis
Where does taeniasis occur?
Taenia saginata and T. solium are found worldwide. Infections with T. saginata occur wherever contaminated raw beef is eaten, particularly in Eastern Europe, Russia, eastern Africa and Latin America. Taeniasis due to T. saginata is rare in the United States, except in places where cattle and people are concentrated and sanitation is poor, such as around feed lots where cattle can be exposed to human feces. Tapeworm infections due to T. solium are more prevalent in under-developed communities with poor sanitation and where people eat raw or undercooked pork. Higher rates of illness have been seen in people in Latin America, Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia. Taenia solium taeniasis is seen in the United States, typically among Latin American immigrants. Taenia asiatica is limited to Asia and is seen mostly in the Republic of Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand.
What are the signs and symptoms of taeniasis?
Most people with tapeworm infections have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Patients with T. saginata taeniasis often experience more symptoms that those with T. solium or T. asiatica infections because the T. saginata tapeworm is larger in size (up to 10 meters (m)) than the other two tapeworms (usually 3 m). Tapeworms can cause digestive problems including abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, and upset stomach. The most visible sign of taeniasis is the active passing of proglottids (tapeworm segments) through the anus and in the feces. In rare cases, tapeworm segments become lodged in the appendix, or the bile and pancreatic ducts.
Infection with T. solium tapeworms can result in human cysticercosis, which can be a very serious disease that can cause seizures and muscle or eye damage.
Taenia saginata does not cause cysticercosis in humans. It is not clear if T. asiatica causes cysticercosis in humans or not.
Is taeniasis common?
Taeniasis is under-reported in a significant portion of the world because diagnosis is difficult in resource-poor settings. The number of new cases in the U.S. each year is probably less than 1000, but an exact number is not known.
What should I do if I think I have taeniasis?
Contact your health care provider for proper diagnosis and care.
Is medication available to treat taeniasis?
Yes. Praziquantel is the drug of choice. Niclosamide is an alternative drug. See your health care provider for proper diagnosis and care.
How did I get taeniasis?
Eating raw or undercooked contaminated beef or pork is the primary risk factor for acquiring taeniasis. Because of this, certain groups with dietary restrictions for these meats may have a lower risk of taeniasis.
How can I prevent infection with taeniasis?
One way to prevent taeniasis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. A food thermometer should be used to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is cooked. USDA recommends the following for meat preparation.
For Whole Cuts of Meat (excluding poultry)
Cook to at least 145° F (63° C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming.
For Ground Meat (excluding poultry)
Cook to at least 160° F (71° C); ground meats do not require a rest* time.
   *According to USDA, “A ‘rest time’ is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven, or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed from the       heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys pathogens.”

Should I be concerned about spreading taeniasis to the rest of my household?
No. However, a disease called cysticercosis can occur when T. solium tapeworm eggs are ingested. For example, people with poor hygiene who have taeniasis — with or without symptoms — will shed tapeworm eggs in their feces and might accidentally contaminate their environment. This can lead to transmission of cysticercosis to themselves or others unknowingly.
More on: cysticercosis
Can I get taeniasis from my dog or cat that was diagnosed with tapeworm infection?
In general, no. The tapeworm that your pet was diagnosed with is more than likely the flea tapeworm (Dipylidium caninum). Dog or cat tapeworm infections are a result of your pet swallowing a parasite-contaminated flea. Only in very rare instances do humans accidentally swallow the contaminated fleas.

Money Laundering
Money laundering generally refers to financial transactions in which criminals, including terrorist organizations, attempt to disguise the proceeds, sources or nature of their illicit activities. Money laundering facilitates a broad range of serious underlying criminal offenses and ultimately threatens the integrity of the financial system. 
The United States Department of the Treasury is fully dedicated to combating all aspects of money laundering at home and abroad, through the mission of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).  TFI utilizes the Department's many assets - including a diverse range of legal authorities, core financial expertise, operational resources, and expansive relationships with the private sector, interagency and international communities - to identify and attack money laundering vulnerabilities and networks across the domestic and international financial systems.""

Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Frequently Asked Questions
FACT SHEET
BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND NONPROLIFERATION
  1. What is the MTCR?
The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) is an informal political understanding among states that seek to limit the proliferation of missiles and missile technology.
2. When was the MTCR established?
The regime was formed in 1987 by the G-7 industrialized countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the United States).
3. Who belongs to the MTCR?
There are currently 35 countries that are members (Partners) of the MTCR: Argentina (1993); Australia (1990); Austria (1991); Belgium (1990); Brazil (1995); Bulgaria (2004); Canada (1987); Czech Republic (1998); Denmark (1990); Finland (1991); France (1987); Germany (1987); Greece 1992); Hungary (1993); Iceland (1993); India (2016); Ireland (1992); Italy (1987); Japan (1987); Luxemburg (1990); Netherlands (1990); New Zealand (1991); Norway (1990); Poland (1998); Portugal (1992); Republic of Korea (2001); Russian Federation (1995); South Africa (1995); Spain (1990); Sweden (1991); Switzerland (1992); Turkey (1997); Ukraine (1998); United Kingdom (1987); United States of America (1987). The date in brackets represents the initial year of membership.
4. What is the purpose of the MTCR?
The MTCR was initiated by like-minded countries to address the increasing proliferation of nuclear weapons by addressing the most destabilizing delivery system for such weapons. In 1992, the MTCR’s original focus on missiles for nuclear weapons delivery was extended to a focus on the proliferation of missiles for the delivery of all types of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), i.e., nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Such proliferation has been identified as a threat to international peace and security. One way to counter this threat is to maintain vigilance over the transfer of missile equipment, material, and related technologies usable for systems capable of delivering WMD.
5. What is the relationship between the MTCR and the UN?
While there is no formal linkage, the activities of the MTCR are consistent with the UN’s non-proliferation and export control efforts. For example, applying the MTCR Guidelines and Annex on a national basis helps countries to meet their export control obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1540.
6. Is the MTCR a treaty?
No. The MTCR is not a treaty and does not impose any legally binding obligations on Partners (members). Rather, it is an informal political understanding among states that seek to limit the proliferation of missiles and missile technology.
7. What are the main objectives of the MTCR?
The MTCR seeks to limit the risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by controlling exports of goods and technologies that could make a contribution to delivery systems (other than manned aircraft) for such weapons. In this context, the Regime places particular focus on rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a range of at least 300 km and on equipment, software, and technology for such systems.
8. How does the MTCR achieve its objectives?
Export Controls The Regime rests on adherence to common export policy (the Guidelines) applied to an integral common list of items (the MTCR Equipment, Software, and Technology Annex.)
Meetings MTCR Partners regularly exchange information about relevant missile non-proliferation issues in the context of the Regime’s overall aims.
Dialogue and Outreach The MTCR Chair and MTCR Partners undertake outreach activities to non-Partners in order to keep them informed about the group’s activities and to provide practical assistance regarding efforts to prevent the proliferation of WMD delivery systems.
9. What are the MTCR Guidelines?
The MTCR Guidelines are the common export control policy adhered to by the MTCR Partners, and to which all countries are encouraged to adhere unilaterally. The Guidelines define the purpose of the MTCR and provide the overall structure and rules to guide the member countries and those adhering unilaterally to the Guidelines.
10. What is the MTCR Annex?
The MTCR Annex  is the Regime’s list of controlled items including virtually all key equipment, materials, software, and technology needed for missile development, production, and operation – that are controlled by MTCR Partners and adherents. The Annex is divided into two parts: Category I and Category II items.
11. How are Annex items controlled?
Consistent with the MTCR Guidelines, MTCR Partners and adherents are to implement license authorization requirements prior to export of items listed in the MTCR Annex.
12. Are there provisions to control non-Annex items?
In 2003, MTCR Partners amended the Guidelines to require all Partners to have catch-all export controls. These controls form the basis for controlling the export of items not included on a control list when they may be intended for use in connection with delivery systems for WMD other than manned aircraft. Additionally, consistent with the Guidelines, Partners are to exercise particular restraint in consideration of any items on the Annex or of any missiles (whether or not on the Annex) if the exporting government judges that they are intended to be used for WMD delivery – and such exports are to be subject to a strong presumption of denial.
13. What is the difference between MTCR Category I and Category II Items?
Category I items include complete rocket and unmanned aerial vehicle systems (including ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, sounding rockets, cruise missiles, target drones, and reconnaissance drones), capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a range of at least 300 km, their major complete subsystems (such as rocket stages, engines, guidance sets, and re-entry vehicles), and related software and technology, as well as specially designed production facilities for these items. Pursuant to the MTCR Guidelines, exports of Category I items are subject to an unconditional strong presumption of denial regardless of the purpose of the export and are licensed for export only on rare occasions. Additionally, exports of production facilities for Category I items are prohibited absolutely.
Category II items include other less-sensitive and dual-use missile related components, as well as other complete missile systems capable of a range of at least 300 km, regardless of payload. Their export is subject to licensing requirements taking into consideration the non-proliferation factors specified in the MTCR Guidelines. Exports judged by the exporting country to be intended for use in WMD delivery are to be subjected to a strong presumption of denial.
14. Are exports to Partners treated differently than exports to non Partners?
The MTCR Guidelines do not distinguish between exports to Partners and exports to non-Partners. Moreover, the MTCR Partners have explicitly affirmed that membership in the Regime provides no entitlement to obtain technology from another Partner and no obligation to supply it. Partners are expected to exercise appropriate accountability and restraint in trade among Partners, just as they would in trade between Partners and non-Partners. Partners are bound by a “no-undercut” policy to consult each other before considering exporting an item on the list that has been notified as denied by another Partner pursuant to the MTCR Guidelines.
15. Are the MTCR’s Guidelines binding?
No – the MTCR is not a treaty and does not impose any legally binding obligations on Partners. The only activity prohibited absolutely by the Guidelines, to which all 35 Partner countries voluntarily subscribe, is the export of production facilities for Category I MTCR Annex items.
16. What obligations do Partners have?
There are no legally binding obligations imposed on MTCR Partners. However, Partners are expected to act responsibly and practice restraint with regard to exports of items that could contribute to the proliferation of missiles capable of delivering WMD and to abide by all consensus decisions of the Regime. They set the standard for responsible non-proliferation behaviour and help shape the international missile non-proliferation effort while conducting their missile non-proliferation policies in a manner consistent with the Regime’s overall goals and activities. Partners also are expected to control all exports of equipment and technology controlled on the MTCR Annex according to the stipulations of the MTCR Guidelines.
17. How are export decisions taken?
Export licensing decisions are made by individual countries according to their national export control laws and regulations, and not as group. However, Partners regularly exchange information on relevant licensing matters in order to ensure consistency with the Regime’s overall non-proliferation goals.
18. How is compliance enforced?
Each individual Partner implements the MTCR Guidelines and Annex in accordance with national legislation and practice and on the basis of sovereign national discretion. The MTCR has no regime-wide compliance or verification provisions. When questions arise, Partners consult bilaterally to promote a common understanding of the issue.
19. What benefits do Partners get by becoming members of the MTCR?
Partners can play an active role in curbing the global missile non-proliferation threat. MTCR Partners participate in decision-making on the orientation and future of the MTCR, thereby setting the international standard for responsible missile non-proliferation behaviour and helping to guide the international missile non-proliferation effort. Partners also benefit from discussions and exchanges of information on licensing, interdiction, best practices, and cooperate to impede specific shipments of concern with regards to missile proliferation.
20. Can a country adhere to the Guidelines without joining the MTCR?
The MTCR Partners encourage all countries to observe the Guidelines as a contribution to international peace and security. Countries can apply the Guidelines on a national basis without being obligated to join the Regime.
21. Does the MTCR have an observer status?
No. However, Regime members encourage all countries to adhere unilaterally to the MTCR Guidelines and Annex.
22. When and how often do the MTCR Partners meet?
The MTCR s main meeting is the annual policy-level Plenary meeting, held to discuss and take decisions on all relevant Regime issues. Three Regime sub-groups hold meetings in conjunction with the annual Plenary – the Information Exchange (IE), the Licensing and Enforcement Experts Meeting (LEEM), and the Technical Experts Meetings (TEM). Additionally, there are periodic Reinforced Point of Contact (RPOC) and Monthly Point of Contact (POC) meetings.
23. Is there a central administrative body for the MTCR?
The MTCR has no formal secretariat. France serves as the Regime’s Point of Contact (POC). The POC receives and distributes all Regime documents. The POC also participates in outreach activities and hosts intersessional meetings.
24. What is the Reinforced Point of Contact (RPOC) Meeting?
The RPOC is the MTCR’s intersessional policy-level meeting. It is hosted by France and is normally held in Paris in April or May. RPOC meetings are used primarily to follow up on issues from the previous Plenary and plan for the next Plenary.
25. What is a Point of Contact (POC) Meeting?
POC meetings facilitate the exchange of information among Partners. They are regularly held in Paris, hosted by the French MTCR POC, and include the participation of Embassy Representatives of MTCR countries.
26. Who is the MTCR Chair? How are they chosen?
The MTCR Chairmanship rotates on an ad hoc basis. Normally the country that hosts the Plenary then serves as Chair for the ensuing year.
27. How are decisions made in the MTCR?
All MTCR decisions including decisions on membership require a consensus decision by all current Regime members.
28. How often does the MTCR meet with non-members?
The MTCR Partners engage in a robust outreach program to promote the Regime’s goals and encourage broad support for its activities. The Regime also uses its outreach efforts to encourage countries to unilaterally adhere to the MTCR Guidelines. In 2009, following the MTCR RPOC meeting, the Partners held a Technical Outreach Meeting (TOM) for non-Partners to make them aware of the changes to the MTCR Annex that had taken place at the 2007 and 2008 plenaries and to explain how these changes would affect licensing reviews. Fifteen non-MTCR countries participated in that TOM. TOMs have since been held in 2014 (Paris) and 2016 (Luxembourg).

Abstract
At the time when antibiotics and other pharmacy products did not exist, a bulb of garlic itself represented a whole pharmacy industry due to the broad spectrum of effects. Most different suppositions involving this herb are mentioned; some of them were so pointless that they disappeared in time, but some of them have remained until the present days. The garlic was given different names that are still in use such as ‘Russian penicillin’, ‘natural antibiotic’, ‘vegetable viagra’, ‘plant talisman’, ‘rustic's theriac’, ‘snake grass’ etc. Presentation of the development of ideas associated with garlic and the evolution of the notions increased the ability of the pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges of their professional services in facilitating human life.

INTRODUCTION
Garlic (Allium sativum L. Fam. Liliaceae) is a widely distributed plant. Nowadays, it is cultivated all over the world. In our region, it is the most important preventive remedy, a universal folk spice and food, a well-trusted remedy. In the past, garlic has been utilized as a remedy during the various epidemics such as typhus, dysentery, cholera, influenza, and whenever an epidemic has emerged, garlic has been the first preventive and curative remedy.[1] In the ancient and middle centuries and a long time during the modern period, garlic has been appreciated as a remedy by physicians from different nations. Recently there has been scientific research into garlic, and good results have been obtained in healing many diseases, from which for thousands years nations from various continents had been protecting themselves and healing by using garlic. Therefore, there is an increased necessity of research on the history of garlic for the sake of reinforcing the ability of pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges arising in the provision of professional services in order to facilitate human life.

CHRONOLOGY FROM THE PAST TO THE PRESENT
History of Garlic
The native land of garlic is Middle Asia.[2] There are a range of beliefs as to the exact origin of garlic such as that it originates from West China, around Tien Shan Mountains to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
Sumerians (2600–2100 BC) were actively utilizing the garlic healing qualities, and there is a belief that they brought the garlic to China, from where it was later spread to Japan and Korea. Garlic expansion probably occurred in the old world first, and later in the new world. Nonetheless, some historians still claim that garlic originates from China.[3]
In ancient China, garlic was one of the most used remedies since 2700 BC. Then, owing to its heating and stimulating effects, it was placed in yang (the yin yang concept, according to which in the good there is bad and in the bad there is good). Garlic was recommended to those who suffer from depression. Therefore, because of these stimulating effects of the garlic, the Japanese have not included garlic in the Buddhist tradition. The Japanese cuisine does not appreciate garlic either.[4]
In ancient Indian medicine, garlic was a valuable remedy used as a tonic, roborans, to cure a lack of appetite, common weakness, cough, skin disease, rheumatism, haemorrhoids etc. In the Vedas – the Indian holy book – garlic was mentioned among other medicinal plants. Indian priests were the first physicians and pharmacists, and unsurprisingly the healing was accompanied and complemented by diverse spells and rituals, prayers, secret and magnificent ceremonies.[3]
The Egyptians were familiar with many medicinal, aromatic, spicy and poisonous plants. In the beginning, when they were still minor and impoverished, they were satisfied with their own medicinal plants from their flora, around the Nile River. It was garlic that was used most. Subsequently, when they were gaining power and mercantile importance, they were increasingly searching for medicinal plants with strong physiological activity, strong spices and aromas from the East. The usage of garlic continued but now as food and remedy of poor, i.e. the slaves.[3] The Egyptians fed their slaves with garlic to make them strong and capable of doing more work. The Old Greek historian Herodotus[1] wrote: ‘Inscriptions on the plates of the Egyptian pyramids tell us how much their builders used the garlic for this vegetable, 1600 talents of silver were spent (approximately 30 million dollars)’.[4] In this period, garlic was an irreplaceable nutritional supplement. Builders commonly ate insipid food (different porridges) and only a third of this food was utilized in the organism. If it had not been for the garlic, which builders used to a great deal, they would not have been able to keep balance, let alone pull the gigantic plates. Besides providing them with the necessary quantity of vitamins, garlic additionally supported them with another of its properties – decreasing the need for food.[4] The Egyptian crypts are the oldest visible inscriptions for the existence of garlic. Archaeologists have discovered clayey sculptures of garlic bulbs dating from 3700 BC, while illustrations with garlic have been found in another crypt from 3200 BC. In Ebers papyrus (around 1500 BC) various medicinal plants have been mentioned, and among others the much appreciated garlic, efficient in healing 32 illnesses.[3,4] The youngest pharaoh Tutankhamen (1320 BC) was sent on his trip to life beyond the grave escorted by garlic, as a patron of his soul and protector of his wealth. Archaeologists have discovered garlic bulbs in the pyramids.
Ancient Egypt was of great significance for the healing skills, preparation of remedies and overall for the culture of ancient peoples such as the Phoenicians, Israelis, Babylonians, Persians etc. All of these desert or semi-desert peoples, who essentially were cattle breeders and nomadic, regularly used garlic. Its implication was also felt later, in the Middle and New Ages, with all peoples living around the Mediterranean Sea, and has lasted to date. Consequently, now the countries around the Mediterranean Sea, especially those in the East coast, still use garlic in large quantities.[4]
The Ancient Israelis made use of garlic as a starvation stimulator, blood pressure enhancer, body heater, parasite-killer etc. The Talmud, the book of Judaism prescribes a meal with garlic every Friday. In the Bible a meal with garlic and cheese is mentioned, which used to be consumed by reapers.
The Ancient Greeks also valued garlic although those who had eaten garlic were forbidden entry into the temples (they were called ‘rank roses’). During the archeological excavations in the Knossos Palace on the Greek island of Crete, garlic bulbs were discovered dating from 1850–1400 BC. Early Greek army leaders fed their army with garlic before major battles. It is an interesting fact that while nowadays some athletes take a wide spectrum of dangerous tranquilizers, Greek Olympic athletes eat garlic to ensure a good score.[4,5] According to Theophrastus (370–285 BC), the Greeks offered gifts to their Gods consisting of garlic bulbs, which they used to lay on the main crossroads. Orpheus referred to garlic as a remedy. In his works, Hippocrates (459–370 BC)[6] mentioned garlic as a remedy against intestine parasites, a laxans and a diuretic. Dioscorides (40–90 AD) recommended garlic as a remedy for colic relief,[4] an anthelmintic, for regulating the menstruation cycle and against seasickness.[7] He also recommended garlic as a remedy against snakebite (for that purpose they drank a mixture of garlic and wine) and against mad dog's bite (for that purpose they applied garlic on the wound directly). Hence, the Greeks called garlic a snake grass.[3]
The Tibetans possess ancient recipes to cure stomachache with garlic. It was grown in the gardens of Babylon, and the local population used to call it a ‘rank rose’.
At the beginning when the Romans had not occupied territories outside the small roman state, similar to other primitive and poor nations they were using plants only from their territories, mostly cabbage, garlic and onion, as a remedy, spice and food. Later in the vast and influential Roman Empire, garlic and onion remained to be a remedy, spice and food for survival of the poor, while the rich people were increasingly using and finding pleasure in valuable medicinal plants with intense physiological effects, mostly delicate aromatic spices and aromas from all of the invaded territories in Asia and Africa. Vergilius mentioned the usage of a squashed juice from garlic and wild thyme, and according to him, mowers should lubricate their body with this juice if they wanted to rest peacefully for they would not be bitten by a snake. Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), a Roman physician and scientist from the first century, considered garlic a universal remedy.[6] He wrote that the Egyptians used to take an oath by mentioning garlic and onion, considering them two holy and miraculous plants. In the 1st AD century, Columel said that garlic was used as an aphrodisiac. Celsius in the second century was using garlic to cure tuberculosis and fever.[6] Galen (121–200 AD), the renowned medical writer and physician among Romans, and later among other nations, referred to as the father of galenic pharmacy, spoke of garlic as the most popular folk remedy that cured many diseases and named it a ‘rustic's theriac’. Galen used garlic for regulation of the digestion and against colic.[3,6]
In all mountains of his kingdom, Ashurbanipal, the last great tsar of Assyria, was hiding clay plates on which diverse evidence of the life, customs and rituals of the Babylonian–Assyrian world were recorded. Among the 10000 volumes of this clay library, volumes devoted to medicinal plants existed. In the first Assyrian book of medicinal plants, garlic was given a special place. Cut into large pieces and left in the clay pot, vapor closed for 30 min, garlic was used as a remedy for reducing the body temperature. They prepared tea from garlic and solid resin, which was used as a remedy against constipation. Assyrians prepared tea from garlic as a poultice. In addition, garlic emulsion was used against muscle inflammation. Furthermore, garlic mixture against intestine parasites was made. Garlic was quoted on these clay plates many times, and they also contain data that the tsars paid particular attention to garlic.[4]
In the seventh century AD the Slavic people used garlic against lice, spider bite and snakebite and against ulcers and crusts.[8]
In the Arabic school medicine in the Middle Ages, garlic was a specially valued remedy.[6] In the Middle Ages, Arabic physicians contributed to a large extent for the expansion of the usage of garlic as a remedy. In the same period, the retrograde Western Europe knew nothing about garlic.[3]
With Eclogue – law of the Byzantine Empire in the eighth century, the cultivation of garlic was encouraged. In St. Clement's time (ninth century), garlic was used for prevention of blood vessels aging. Garlic was also recommended as a remedy in the literary works of Macedonian health educators (Pejchinovski and Krchovski) in the 19th century. Garlic was also stated in Ohrid's book of remedies by Eftim Sprostranov, as a remedy against blood pressure, typhoid fever abdominals, icterus, alopecia.[8]
Garlic was brought into Great Britain in 1548, from the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, where it was present in abundance[4] Lonicerus (in 1564) recommended garlic against helminthes, and externally for curing a range of skin diseases and dandruff.[3] In ancient Europe, it was used without restrictions – particularly in Italy, while the French used to add it to a lot of dishes. The wild garlic was growing and was cultivated in church courtyards in England for centuries. In all likelihood, the cultivation of garlic commenced in England before the 16th century. It has been proven that garlic is one of the first plants to have been cultivated by man. Over the time people have learned to prepare teas and tinctures from garlic and simultaneously learned how to mix equal quantities of garlic and honey etc. As a result, they beat many gastric infections, learned how to fight cold, fever, diarrhea, thereby prolonging the life of many sick people. Owing to garlic, in 1720 a thousand inhabitants of Marseille were saved from the spread of the epidemic of plague.[4] In 1858, Louis Pasteur wrote that garlic killed bacteria. As he maintained, it was effective even against some bacteria resistant to other factors. He also noted that garlic killed Helicobacter pylori.[9] The antiseptic properties of garlic were confirmed in the keeping down of cholera (in 1913), typhoid fever and diphtheria (in 1918) in Beirut.[6] French phytotherapist Lekrek used garlic as a preventive remedy with success during the great pandemic of influenza, the so-called ‘Spanish fever’, in 1918.[6] During the epidemic of influenza in America during 1917 and 1918, people wore a necklace of garlic when going out in public.[9]
Garlic is also known as Russian penicillin because Russian physicians used it for a long time for treatment of respiratory tract diseases, and along with other compounds it was used as an inhalator remedy for children. In Russia, garlic was also used during preparation for piloting and for a range of military assignments. Very often it was used in the treatment of German soldiers during World War I.[5] Although penicillin was already used in World War II, the Russian Red Army continued using garlic. Therefore, garlic was renamed into Russian penicillin or natural antibiotic.[9]
Medical properties of garlic
Garlic has a slight, imperceptible smell until it has been peeled. Once it is peeled, sliced or crushed, it immediately begins to spread an intense smell, distinctive of all plants (horse radish, mustard etc.) that contain sulfur's glycosides. All of these drugs have more or less a sharp smell; in touch with the skin, one feels heat first, then pain. It is been a long since people learned that by distillation with water vapor, garlic yields etheric oil with its characteristic sharp smell. The examination of the chemical content of that oil commenced in 1844. In 1892 and later, it was confirmed that garlic consists of several aliphatic unsaturated sulfur compounds. As late as in 1944, the oily, colorless, unstable substance called allicin was isolated from garlic by Cavallito and Bailey. Later it was established that allicin has strong bactericide power. Even in dilution 1 : 85000 to 1 : 250000, allicin showed antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[10] In 1947, the chemical formula of allicin was determined. In 1947 another compound called alliin, with needle-shaped crystals without smell, was isolated. Alliin has no antibacterial action but by adding the enzyme alliinase from fresh garlic, allicin having strong antibacterial action is produced.[3]
As indicated by a number of studies, not only does garlic have nutritional components that are vital for the human body but also it can be used against different diseases. It is particularly important in nutrition and in medicine given that it contains compounds such as, sulfur's compounds (alliin, allicin, diallyl sulfide, ajoene etc.) water, cellulose, amino acids, lipids, etheric oil, complex of fructosans (carbohydrates), steroid saponosides, organic acids, minerals (Mg, Zn, Se, germanium), vitamins (C, A, from B complex), enzymes etc.[11]
The action of garlic is manifold. Because of allicin and other sulfur compounds, garlic has antibiotic, antibacterial and antimycotic action, which has been testified by in vitro studies.[5,12,13] The allicin is excreted partly by the respiratory organs; therefore garlic is used to treat respiratory tract diseases. The French phytotherapist Lecraec used garlic tincture in treatment of a patient with pulmonary gangrene. The patient recovered in 17 days.[14]
Recent studies have revealed that garlic protects from common cold. For that purpose, patients have been examined during a period of 12 weeks, in the cold season from November to February. The results have demonstrated that those who took garlic were less prone to catching a cold or endured the cold easier than those who were given placebo.[15,16]
Allicin and other garlic compounds have hypocholesterolemic, hypolipidemic and antihypertensive activity[17,18] The anti-cholesterolemic and antilipidemic action of garlic has experimentally been proved in rabbits and rats,[19] and the antihypertensive action of garlic in rats.[11] Garlic protects from LDL cholesterol. It decreases the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol in blood.[5,10] Thus far, much clinical research has been conducted on defined preparations of garlic, which indicate hypocholesterolemic and hypotensive action.[12,20] But, there are also observations in which garlic preparations did not show a considerable decrease of cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia.[21,22] Probably these opposite views are related to the use of different doses, standardization of garlic preparations, and different period of treatment.[23] Meta-analysis of randomly chosen literary data has demonstrated that garlic is related to decrease of blood pressure in patients with increased systolic pressure but not in patients without increased systolic pressure[24]
By decreasing the serum lipids, garlic reduces the risk of atherosclerosis, whereby it prevents depositing of lipids in blood vessels.[18,25] People from countries that often use garlic in their cuisine are less susceptible to blood vessel diseases, especially atherosclerosis.
Ajoenes from garlic possess antithrombotic effect:[5] they inhibit lipoxygenases, increase fibrinolysis and decrease thrombocytes aggregation.[10,12,17] Significant antithrombotic action has been shown with in vivo and in vitro systems.[18] German Commission E also prescribes the impact of garlic and its preparations on prolonged bleeding and coagulation time.[26]
Garlic prevents free radicals generation and supports body protective mechanisms that destroy free radicals.[17] Six powerful phenylpropanoids have been isolated from garlic peel.[22] The antioxidative and antihypertensive effect of garlic has been observed in 20 patients with hypertension compared to 20 patients with normal pressure, who have been receiving garlic pearls preparation for a period of two months. The results have revealed decreased blood pressure, significant reduction of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosin, level of nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation, and an increased level of antioxidative vitamins (C and E). This study has pointed to the beneficial cardio-protective action of garlic in essential hypertension.[28]
The proven antioxidative, hypocholesterolemic, antithrombotic and antihypertensive properties of garlic help in the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and lessen the risk of development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.[29,30]
Garlic has a strong anticarcinogenic potential. Allicin has proved to be active against sarcoma in rats.[18] The garlic extract stops mitosis of carcinogenic cells in all phases, without unwanted side effects.[5] In vivo examinations have shown that ajoene has powerful anti-leukemic action in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.[31] Scientists from Britain are of the opinion that high doses of garlic extract can help in prevention of cancer. All recent research in the world conducted on this plant is based precisely on such assumptions that garlic contains compounds that are a potential remedy against cancer.[32] A large number of scientists are already convinced and have achieved results in this field.[4,17]
Individuals suffering from gastric diseases and excessive excretion of hydrochloric acid find it hard to tolerate garlic. Therefore, nowadays, throughout the world, there is increased production of garlic preparations, for increase of appetite, body strengthening, as stimulants of the nervous system, against high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arteriosclerosis, children's helminthes, as effective antiseptic, preventive means against an array of infective diseases (typhoid fever, influenza, diphtheria, cholera), against chronic bronchitis, against dandruff and hair fall, as expectorants, and a cure for ulcers, stoppage of suppuration etc.
Today, garlic as well as garlic preparations are prescribed in many pharmacopoeias in the world, including Ph Eur 6,[33] USP XXXI,[34] BP 2007.[35] It is also incorporated in the list of German Commission E, which is a therapeutic guide in herbal medicine, complied by a special expert commission of German Federal Institute of Medicines and Medical Inventions. German Commission E recommends usage of an average dose of 4 g of fresh garlic or equivalent preparations of garlic as a supplement to hyperlipemic patients’ diet and in prevention of vascular alterations caused by aging.[26]

CONCLUSIONS
Garlic is the plant necessary in everyday life from the past until the present days. It contains active compounds that are responsible for its effect on almost every part of the human body. Garlic is an excellent tonic for the human organism. It has been used for medical treatment of everything, from ancient civilizations to date. Not with standing its confirmed action, in the past it was avoided, even banned, only because of its sharp and unpleasant smell.
From all of the above-mentioned data, it can be concluded that administration of garlic should not be avoided; on the contrary, its intake should be as much as possible since it underlies human health.

U.S.-Russia Relations: “Reset” Fact Sheet
In one of his earliest new foreign policy initiatives, President Obama sought to reset relations with Russia and reverse what he called a “dangerous drift” in this important bilateral relationship.  President Obama and his administration have sought to engage the Russian government to pursue foreign policy goals of common interest – win-win outcomes -- for the American and Russian people.  In parallel to this engagement with the Russian government, President Obama and his administration also have engaged directly with Russian society -- as well as facilitated greater contacts between American and Russian business leaders, civil society organizations, and students -- as a way to promote our economic interests, enhance mutual understanding between our two nations, and advance universal values.  On the occasion of President Medvedev’s visit to the United States and one year after President Obama visited Russia, it is time to take stock of what has been achieved from this change in policy and what remains to be done in developing a more substantive relationship with Russia.
Government-to-Government Agreements and Accomplishments
The New START Treaty:
On April 8, 2010, in Prague, Presidents Obama and Medvedev signed the New START Treaty, a strategic offensive arms reduction treaty to follow-up on the START Treaty, which expired on December 5, 2009.  The New START Treaty reduces limits on U.S. and Russian deployed strategic warheads by approximately one third.  The Treaty provides the flexibility needed for the United States to structure its forces at the reduced level to meet national security and operational requirements.

 The Treaty limits each side to 1550 deployed strategic warheads, 700 deployed strategic delivery vehicles, and 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers and heavy bombers equipped with nuclear armaments.  The Treaty has a strong verification regime to allow each party to confirm that the other party is in compliance with the treaty limits, including on-site inspections, data exchanges, exhibitions, and notifications about the movement and production of strategic systems, as well as a provision on non-interference with National Technical Means of verification.

In their June 24 Joint Statement on Strategic Stability, President Obama and President Medvedev acknowledged their commitment to continuing the development of a new strategic relationship based on mutual trust, openness, predictability and cooperation by following up on the New START Treaty.

Iran:

Since 2009, President Obama and President Medvedev have worked closely to address the international challenge presented by Iran’s nuclear program and its failure to meet its international obligations, and have built a strategic partnership on this issue.  Robust U.S.-Russia cooperation on Iran has manifested itself through the P5+1, as well as on the original IAEA proposal to supply nuclear fuel to the Tehran Research Reactor in exchange for Iran’s low enriched uranium being shipped out of Iran and held under IAEA safeguards.

As a result of Iran’s continued failure to meet its international obligations on its nuclear program, President Obama and President Medvedev worked closely with other members of the UN Security Council to reach an agreement on UN Security Council Resolution 1929, the most comprehensive set of sanctions against Iran to date, to demonstrate that there will be a cost to Iran for not meeting its international obligations on its nuclear program.  U.S.-Russian partnership in crafting this resolution was critical to its successful adoption.  UNSCR 1929 imposes restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities; its ballistic missile program; and, for the first time, its conventional military.  This was a particularly important step for Russia, which has confirmed that it will not deliver S-300 missiles to Iran, in accordance with the new resolution.   The resolution will put a new framework in place to counter Iranian smuggling, and crack down on Iranian banks and financial transactions.  It targets individuals, entities, and institutions – including those associated with the Revolutionary Guard.

North Korea:

Russia joined the United States in supporting UN Security Council resolution 1874 in response to North Korea’s nuclear test.  The resolution condemned in the strongest terms the May 25, 2009, nuclear test by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and tightened sanctions against it by blocking funding for nuclear, missile and proliferation activities through targeted sanctions on additional goods, persons and entities, widening the ban on arms imports-exports, and called on Member States to inspect and destroy all banned cargo to and from that country    on the high seas, at seaports and airports    if they have reasonable grounds to suspect a violation.

Non-Proliferation:

In addition to the New Start Treaty and actions taken against Iran and North Korea, the U.S. and Russia have made significant progress in developing our common nonproliferation agenda over the past eighteen months.  Russia joined the United States in supporting the UN Security Council Resolution 1887 on September 24, 2009.  Russia also played a critical role in President Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, held on April 12-13, 2010.  On the sidelines of this meeting, the United States and Russia signed a protocol to amend the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement, which commits both countries to dispose of 68 metric tons or approximately 17,000 nuclear weapons-worth of excess weapons-grade plutonium. Russia recently shut down its last remaining weapons-grade plutonium production power plant. 

 Russia also has established an international nuclear fuel bank that provides incentives for other nations not to acquire sensitive uranium enrichment technology.  In support of the July 2009, U.S.-Russia Joint Statement on Nuclear Cooperation, the United States and Russia have accelerated and expanded efforts to secure and remove vulnerable nuclear material from around the world.  In particular, we have worked together to remove or dispose of 475 kilograms of nuclear weapons-usable highly enriched uranium fuel and plutonium (enough for over 19 nuclear weapons) from 8 countries.  This included the complete removal of all weapons-usable HEU from three countries.  While it is not yet agreed, Russia has been supportive of U.S. efforts within the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to strengthen controls over enrichment and reprocessing technologies.  The U.S. and Russia also continue to build upon over fifteen years of significant cooperation to strengthen the security of nuclear facilities and materials.
 
Afghanistan:

Over the last 18 months, the Obama Administration has expanded the volume of supplies being shipped to our troops in Afghanistan through the Northern Distribution Network (NDN), thanks in part to Russia’s agreement to allow ground and air transit for troops and supplies for Afghanistan through its territory.  At present, 30 percent of supplies to our troops in Afghanistan travel over the NDN, and of this cargo, 65 percent of the supplies being routed through the NDN transit through Russia.   Russia’s participation in the NDN has allowed the U.S. to expand more efficient and direct routes that offer a strategic and vital alternative to the Pakistan routes.  
Russia’s agreement to fund the navigation and flight fees for 4,300 official U.S. flights and allow air transit for unlimited amounts of commercial charter flights with supplies has been vital to bringing in troops and supplies for the surge in troops President Obama ordered as a result of his review of our efforts to secure and stabilize Afghanistan.   Since the Afghanistan Air Transit Agreement was signed with Russia at the July 2009 summit, over 35,000 U.S. personnel and troops have flown to Afghanistan via the Russian routes.  Russian companies also have provided vital airlift capacity for over 12,000 flights in support of our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, thirty percent of the fuel U.S. military troops use in Afghanistan, and over 80 MI-17 helicopters to the Afghan National Army, Afghan National Police, and Afghan Drug Interdiction Forces. During their meeting on June 24, 2010, President Medvedev pledged to provide 3 more MI-17 helicopters to the NATO-led effort in Afghanistan, and offered to provide more than a dozen more under a special financial arrangement.

In addition, the Counternarcotics Working Group under the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission has established cooperation on reducing the supply of narcotics from Afghanistan to Russian territory, including joint operations, enhanced information sharing, stopping illicit financing of Afghan-related terrorism from narcotics trafficking, and cooperation on demand reduction.

Kyrgyzstan:

In response to the coming to power of a Provisional Government in Kyrgyzstan in April 2010, Presidents Medvedev and Obama and their administrations closely coordinated their efforts to enhance stability.  After the tragic outbreak of violence in Osh and Jalalabad in June 2010, American and Russian diplomats have closely coordinated our common responses, both in the provision of humanitarian assistance and in the development of multilateral responses to the crisis.  On June 24, Presidents Obama and Medvedev issued a joint statement affirming our common interest in supporting the people of Kyrgyzstan in their efforts to prevent further violence, address the current humanitarian crisis, and restore stability and democracy.

Georgia:

The Obama Administration continues to have serious disagreements with the Russian government over Georgia.  We continue to call for Russia to end its occupation of the Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and in parallel have worked with the Russian government to prevent further military escalations in the region.  We have witnessed some incremental confidence building measures, such as opening the border at Verkhniy Lars and allowing direct charter flights between the two countries, and continue to press for the strengthening of the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms and a return of international observers to the two occupied regions of Georgia.

Accelerating Russia’s WTO Accession:

After a long lull while Russia focused on forming its Customs Union with the Republics of Belarus and Kazakhstan, the United States and Russia have intensified their discussion regarding Russia’s WTO accession.  On April 27, 2010, First Deputy Prime Minister Shuvalov led a high-level Russian government delegation to Washington to meet with Director of the White House National Economic Council Larry Summers, USTR Ambassador Ron Kirk, and other senior Obama administration officials.  This meeting produced a roadmap of necessary steps needed to be taken by Russia to accelerate its WTO accession. The United States pledged to provide additional technical assistance to help speed the process of revising Russia’s WTO Working Party Report taking into account the new Customs Union.  On June 24, based on the significant progress achieved, including agreement on the treatment of state-owned enterprises, and provided that Russia fully implements the mutually agreed upon action plan for bringing Russian legislation into compliance with WTO requirements, the Presidents agreed to aim to settle remaining bilateral issues by September 30.

American-Russian Cooperation in Managing the Global Financial Crisis:

The United States and Russia have collaborated closely within the framework of the G20 on measures to address the global economic crisis, and on the coordination of the reform of financial regulation.  In addition, the United States and Russia have worked to improve the governance and capacity of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Resubmission of the 123 Agreement:

If approved, the U.S.-Russia 123 Agreement would provide a solid foundation for long-term U.S.-Russia civil nuclear cooperation; create commercial opportunities for U.S. industry; and enhance cooperation on important global nonproliferation benefits.  The Agreement would allow for potential commercial sales of civil nuclear commodities to Russia by U.S. industry and joint ventures between U.S. and Russian firms to develop and market civil nuclear items as well as proliferation-resistant nuclear technologies.  In addition, the Agreement has the potential to increase cooperation between Russia and the United States in their nuclear supply policies and approach to the fuel cycle.

Energy Efficiency:

On June 24, our Presidents agreed to implement a multifaceted initiative to promote energy efficiency and the development of clean energy technologies under the Action Plan of the Bilateral Presidential Commission’s Energy Working Group.  The centerpiece of this collaboration will be the development of a pilot smart grid project based on the most innovative technologies to cut losses in electric power systems and reduce emissions.  Russian and U.S. cities will be matched to implement similar projects, and to share best practices and technical information.  The Action Plan also includes implementing energy management and technical programs to improve energy efficiency in Russian and U.S. public sector buildings.  The U.S. and Russia also agreed to develop financial mechanisms to help create investment incentives for small and medium sized private companies to promote energy efficiency and clean technologies.

Creation of the Presidential Bilateral Commission:

During their meeting in Moscow on July 6, 2009, Presidents Medevedev and Obama established the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Commission consisting of sixteen working groups ranging from nuclear cooperation, space, health, military-to-military, cultural and sports exchange, to civil society.  Since the creation of the commission, dozens of delegations have traveled to each country, video conferences have been held, and numerous new bilateral activities and programs have emerged to pursue projects of mutual benefit to the American and Russian people.  We also agreed to add an Intelligence Sharing Working Group to the Commission.  The Commission’s first annual report was published on June 24, 2010, and can be accessed at the Commissions website: www.state.gov/russiabpc

Military-to-Military Cooperation:

Russia and the United States agreed to renew bilateral military cooperation and have approved a work-plan for this cooperation under the Defense Cooperation Working Group of the Bilateral Presidential Commission.  Russia and the United States also have cooperated successfully on anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia and have committed to intensify counter-piracy cooperation.  The U.S. sponsored Russia’s UN Security Council resolution for an UN-led study on the cost and effectiveness of various approaches to prosecute pirates.

Dual Track Engagement in Support of Universal Values:

The Obama Administration has pursued a strategy of dual-track engagement – engagement of Russian government officials and in parallel Russian civil society -- to advance democracy and human rights within Russia.  Through government-to-government channels, the Obama Administration has looked for ways to support President Medvedev’s efforts at fighting corruption and deepening the rule of law.  In the spring of 2010, American and Russian officials met several times to discuss open government initiatives in both countries, interactions which produced the Joint Statement on Open Government released by our two countries during President Medvedev’s visit to Washington on June 24, 2010.  The Working Group on Civil Society also has tackled the issues of anti-corruption, child protection, prison reform, and migration.

In parallel to these government-to-government exchanges, Obama Administration officials meet frequently and directly with Russian civil society leaders, be it through President Obama’s attendance at  parallel civil society summit in Moscow last July, President Obama’s meeting with human rights activists from Russia and other countries in February 2010, Secretary Clinton’s meeting with human rights activities and civil society leaders in Moscow in October 2009, or everyday encounters between U.S. government officials and Russian civil society leaders in Moscow and Washington.  The Obama Administration also has encouraged peer-to-peer dialogues between American and Russian civil society leaders, while at the same time expanding financial support through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for programs on rule of law, human rights, civil society, media, and political processes.

While seeking to engage the Russian government and Russian civil society in ways to promote universal values, the Obama Administration has not shied away from criticizing human rights abuses, including our public condemnation of the murder of human rights defender Natalya Estemirova, our statement on irregularities in the October 2009 regional elections, and our expression of concerns for arrests of peaceful demonstrators.  Speeches by President Obama and Secretary Clinton in Moscow have underscored our commitment to defending human rights and advancing democracy around the world, including in Russia.

Supporting President Medvedev’s Initiative on Innovation:

The Obama Administration has welcomed President Medvedev’s focus on innovation and has looked for ways to support this initiative.  In February, 2010, the State Department and National Security Staff led a delegation of high-tech executives to Moscow and Novosibirsk to help promote this innovation agenda, including promoting entrepreneurship, openness and transparency, internet freedom and freedom of expression, and the use of communications technologies to augment the work of traditional civil society organizations.  In the wake of this visit, a new forum called “Rustechdel” has been created, matching information technology professionals with civil society actors.  Russian civil society organizations in Siberia have adopted tools, such as live streaming to conduct training for Siberian non-governmental organizations in managing administrative responsibilities and promoting respect for human rights.  Private sector Russian entities have teamed up with healthcare experts to establish a “Text4Baby” program, using sms texting to inform pregnant mothers of issues related to the health of them and their babies.  Private sector entities from the United States are working to outfit orphanages in Novosibirsk with computers and links to the internet as well as partnering with Russian non-governmental organizations to provide mentoring in life skills and appropriate usage.  United States non-governmental organizations have teamed up with Russian partners to offer prizes to Russian software developers to produce programs and tools that would help to combat trafficking in persons.  In May 2010, Obama Administration officials also participated in the “The First Venture Capital Trip to Russia”, a program organized by AmBar and Rusnano which brought two dozen venture capitalist from the United States to Russia to explore investment opportunities.  During President Medvedev’s visit to Washington on June 24, the U.S. and Russian government issued joint statements on collaboration in the areas of innovation and open government.

Supporting People-to-People Exchanges:

The Education, Culture, Sports and Media Working Group of the U.S.–Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission has expanded and enriched connections between Russians and Americans through arts exchanges, sports diplomacy, cultural performances, exhibitions, and engagement through traditional and social media.  The State Department has committed to a substantial increase in Fiscal Year 2010 funds to support these activities.  In parallel, new non-government partnerships between Russian and American student organizations, cultural groups, and artists have expanded, sometimes with but oftentimes without U.S. government support. On June 24, 2010, Presidents Obama and Medvedev issued a Joint Statement on People-to-People Connections, articulating a shared desire to see such contacts continue to grow.

The U.S.-Russian Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law:

In June 2009, the U.S.-Russia Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law (USRF) registered in Russia as an affiliate of the non-profit organization USRF in the United States and has begun to work with Russian institutions to develop projects that encapsulate the principles of enterprise, accountability, and partnership.  Among other new projects and grants, the USRF continues to support the Center for Entrepreneurship in Russia.
Private, Non-Governmental Initiatives and Activities
Parallel Business Summits:

In July 2009, during the Presidential Summit in Moscow, American and Russian business associations convened a parallel business summit that included hundreds of business representatives and CEOs from both countries.  During the June 24, 2010 summit in Washington, American and Russian CEOs convened a small meeting of representatives from a number of different sectors to discuss ways in which to expand trade and investment and foster conditions conducive to innovation in both countries.  American and Russian business associations also convened a parallel business summit that included participation by senior government officials from both countries.

Parallel Civil Society Summits:

In July 2009, American and Russian non-governmental organizations, including Eurasia Foundation, the New Eurasia Foundation, and CSIS convened a parallel civil society summit to coincide with the Presidential summit in Moscow.  American and Russian non-governmental organizations gathered to discuss a number of themes including anti-corruption measures, community development, health, and media among others.  During the meeting, President Obama appeared, hearing reports from representatives of the different working groups and making remarks.  During the June 24 summit in Washington, IREX and New Eurasia convened a steering group meeting of civil society organizations, many of whom participated during the 2009 summit, to continue discussion in many of the same thematic areas and additional ones, such as education and child protection.  During the session, information technology specialists interacted with traditional civil society actors to offer suggestions and ideas for how new technologies and innovation can complement and augment the work of the different groups.  The steering committee laid the foundation for institutional engagement in the coming year for expanded participation by both American and Russian groups.

Expanding Trade and Investment:

Rostechnologiya and Boeing signed a proposal acceptance to enter into a sale of 50 737 Boeing aircraft with a potential additional sale of 15 planes to the Russian national airline Aeroflot.  The multi-billion dollar sale will create potentially 44,000 new jobs in America’s aerospace industry.   U.S. companies have opened new manufacturing facilities in Russia in the areas of soft drinks, paper, and tractors.  In July 2009, PepsiCo announced it will invest nearly one billion USD in drink and food manufacturing facilities in Russia, including a new bottling plant in the Domodedovo, Moscow region.  In April 2010, a joint venture between International Paper and Ilim Pulp announced an investment of 700 million USD to build a new kraft pulp mill in Bratsk.  That same month, Deere & Company announced the opening of a new manufacturing and parts distribution facility, amounting to approximately a 500 million USD investment.  In May 2010, Kimberly-Clark announced the opening of a 170 million dollar plant in the Moscow region producing diapers.  On June 4, 2010, GE entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Russian state corporations Russian Technologies and Inter RAO UES, to pursue a strategic cooperation relationship for the production and distribution of industrial products needed to address Russia’s growing infrastructure demands.  The MOU specifically contemplates the formation of joint ventures in the areas of power generation and healthcare equipment.  While the terms of the joint venture agreements have yet to be finalized, the arrangement could result in billions of dollars in revenues to GE over five years, ultimately helping to support jobs and innovation in both Russia and the United States.  On June 17, 2010, Chevron Corp. and OAO Rosneft agreed to explore for oil and natural gas on a block in the Black Sea, a project that could lead to more than 1 trillion rubles ($32 billion) in spending. On June 17, 2010 American lithium-ion battery manufacturer Ener1, Inc. signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia's Federal Grid Company (MICEX: FEES) to help develop new opportunities to use high-performance battery systems to improve the reliability and performance of the Russian electricity system, which is facing record setting demand on an aging grid.  In June, Siguler Guff & Company, a U.S.-based private equity firm, made a $250 million commitment towards the development of Russia’s innovation economy through its investment in a network of carrier-neutral data centers being built in Moscow and other Russian cities.   The company’s Russia-based sponsor, DataSpace, responsible for overseeing this investment, will locate its headquarters in Skolkovo, the future high-tech center.  On June 23, during President Medvedev’s visit to Silicon Valley, Cisco announced a pledge of one billion dollars in investments over the next ten years in technology projects in Russia, and that it would establish a second headquarters at Skolkovo for its emerging technologies unit.  U.S. angel investors in the high-tech sector have created business incubators in Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk and, working with Russian partners, have created an entrepreneurial fund for Russian start-ups.  The Russian government has liberalized its visa and registration requirements for skilled workers coming to work in the area of innovation.

Changing Russian Attitudes toward the United States:

According the Pew Research Center, the number of Russians with a favorable attitude towards the United States has increased from 44 percent in 2009 to 57 percent in June 2010.  In another poll by the Moscow-based Levada Center, Russian favorable attitudes towards the United States increased from 38 percent in January 2009 to 60 percent in May 2010.  According to Levada, the percentage of Russians with negative attitudes has decreased from 49 percent in January 2009 to 26 percent in May 2010.

Preserving U.S.-Russian Historical Legacy:

On June 22, 2010, the Russian company Renova signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Office of the Governor of California establishing a foundation that will assist in the restoration of the historic Fort Ross, the hub of the southernmost Russian settlements in California at the beginning of the 19th century.

""Russia is a world leader in its reserves of oil, natural gas, gold, diamonds, silver, copper, lead, iron ore and coal. This is our natural competitive advantage, which we must use, but use wisely. Ultimately, mining accounts for over 30% of the country’s GDP. Today geological exploration is a promising and attractive enterprise, where each rouble invested by the government attracts 10 roubles of private investment.""
Transcript of the beginning of the meeting:
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
As usual, let's begin with the latest updates.
We have devoted a lot of time and attention to removing various unnecessary administrative barriers, especially for the construction industry. Mr Kozak, please. I asked you to prepare a relevant proposal.
Dmitry Kozak: Yesterday you signed a government executive order approving an action plan to improve government supervision and licensing policies as well as streamline government services for the construction industry and urban planning. We held extensive discussions on the subject with the construction industries and concluded that the root of the problem lies in the economy, where, as a result of several historical factors and the lack of progress in implementing reform, investors in major construction projects face some of the most significant administrative barriers.
This executive order and the government's action plan to eliminate administrative barriers are especially relevant for the construction industry today, because data from the Federal State Statistics Service shows that in the first four months of the year the Russian construction industry has failed to reach its pre-crisis level in terms of construction volume and the number of people employed. This order should give a fresh impetus to this industry (if we implement it), raising it to new heights and creating more favourable conditions for investment in major construction projects.
We started preparing this action plan long ago, late last year.
We have already started working on the measures that we have reached an agreement on and that did cause any fundamental differences. A number of measures in the action plan are being implemented. The plan will specify their deadlines. We expect to finish half of them in the first six months of next year, as required by the government executive order.
One of the key issues for eliminating administrative barriers, allocating land and ensuring that land management officials act transparently is improving the mechanism for spatial planning. Following a previous government directive, we prepared and introduced into the State Duma a draft federal law to improve the spatial planning system, which has turned out to be a very important area of our work, because, unfortunately, the system has been overwhelmed with red tape. We've been unable to finish this work for six years, but the draft law that was approved by the government may help us to make substantial progress.
In addition, the draft executive order includes some other measures, such as the creation of a federal geographic information system for spatial planning. The lack of such a system is another major impediment to site development projects, especially in cases when the overall plan or site development plans developed by the regions of the Russian Federation have been prepared, but the quality is low due to a lack of a unified information system.
The new legislation will also streamline rules for allotting land for construction and prohibit allotting land without consulting a comprehensive auction list, which will be established by the law.
We also plan to develop - and this will take some time - amendments to land management and urban planning legislation in order to get rid of the very corrupted procedure for categorising land and transferring land from one category to another, which slows down the process of putting land into economic use.
The new legislation also envisions tax incentives encouraging landowners to put land available for major construction projects into economic use.
There is another very important provision, which complements another government programme. This provision will oblige government bodies to publish information on official websites about all unoccupied land available for major construction, as well as information about all administrative procedures necessary to be carried out in a particular municipality to acquire land and receive the right to its development.
Another important area of our work is strengthening the institution of independent review of project documentation. We should work very closely on this issue. This is a very serious challenge. We need to work out all these mechanisms so that both government and independent experts could review construction projects.
It's also necessary to root out abuse that takes place when new facilities are connected to utilities systems. This is a critical problem that prevents us from speeding up administrative procedures in construction.
Everything, or almost everything except maybe the amendment to the land legislation, will entail extensive reform and an overhaul of land categorisation principles. We expect to finalise all the documents necessary to eliminate administrative barriers in 2010, and we must do everything in our power to ensure that this gets done. If we are successful, we can greatly improve the situation in the industry, which has a decisive influence on the country's economy.
Vladimir Putin: Good. We should finish everything this year, as we agreed. Please do not put this issue on the back burner.
Mr Khloponin (addressing Presidential Envoy to the North Caucasus Federal District), the governor of the Stavropol Territory has requested that the facilities of Mineralnye Vody Airport be transferred to the ownership of this territory. You recently held a meeting to discuss this issue. How is this going? This airport will be upgraded and further developed.
Alexander Khloponin: Mr Putin, following your instruction we held a meeting with all the ministries and agencies involved, as well as with the government of the Stavropol Territory. At the meeting we hammered out the necessary decisions.
On July 1 all the legal documents should be complete, and a certificate on the transfer of the airport facilities to the ownership of the Stavropol Territory should be submitted to the government. The government of the Stavropol Territory and the Ministry of Transport will look into the matter and decide what additional funds are needed to reconstruct the runway and develop the airport infrastructure.
We have coordinated the issue with all the ministries concerned. All necessary documents and regulatory acts will be complete by July 1.
Vladimir Putin: Good, thank you. Mr Trutnev (addressing Minister of Natural Resources and Environment), you planned to meet with our Chinese partners in Khabarovsk to discuss transborder rivers. What exactly do you intend to discuss?
Yury Trutnev: Mr Putin, as you know, pollution of transborder rivers has caused serious concern for residents of Russia's Far East.
The Russian-Chinese agreement for joint preservation and sustainable management of natural resources expired in 2008. We set up a joint system for monitoring 40 types of pollutants. China spent almost $1.5 billion on a programme to treat wastewater. And there have been improvements in water quality, very significant ones in some indicators. However, other concerns remain. Some pollutants are still present at their maximum permissible concentrations. That is why we are meeting with our Chinese colleagues on the site: we want to make sure our previous efforts have been effective and outline a programme for the future.
Vladimir Putin: Good. I also asked you to draft proposals for cleaning up some northern regions, including the Franz Josef Land archipelago and the Northern Sea Route. I'm talking about massive pollution left over after the withdrawal of armed forces and some other units from the region. This mostly pertains to numerous barrels with petroleum products, which were abandoned and froze to the ground. Please, report on this issue.
Yury Trutnev: Following your instructions, we plan to make an inventory, do a cost assessment and make certain legislative improvements. After the bidding process we will need to transfer the ownership of the raw materials and resources retrieved in the clean up to the winner of the bid.
All necessary legislative changes will be introduced by the end of this year. The entire project is estimated to cost approximately 1.2 billion roubles, 110 million roubles of which will be spent at the preliminary stage. This work will serve as a necessary basis for further clean up operations at all 194 sites we have identified in the Russian Federation.
Vladimir Putin: When do you think can we start this work?
Yury Trutnev: We are planning to start this work early next year.
Vladimir Putin: Then all the proposals should be worked out, including the financial aspects. We are working on the budget right now, and we need to know what resources will be needed and when.
Yury Trutnev: Yes.
Vladimir Putin: You and I recently visited a place called Losiny Ostrov. It was on Environment Day. We had a group of schoolchildren with us. One of the young environmentalists, Dima Tokarev, proposed tougher punishment for environmental pollution. He sent me a letter. I will forward these proposals to you. Please respond accordingly.
Yury Trutnev: I absolutely agree with the young environmentalist's wishes. We will fulfill your instructions.
Vladimir Putin: Very well. Thank you. Mr Sechin (Addressing Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin), another issue that is closely linked with the environment is developing deposits in East Siberia. We have discussed taxing this type of activity in this region.
Igor Sechin:  In accordance with the decisions taken last February in Kirishi, and in connection with the falling price of crude oil on the world market, since December 2009 we have imposed a zero percent export duty on East Siberian fields.
This measure supports the oil industry, namely by increasing investment in the development of the fields in the region, and has proven its effectiveness and timeliness.
However, because the federal budget must be balanced in the medium term, and considering that some fields in the region are expected to generate profitable returns during this period, we propose a new method for determining export duties for East Siberian oil.
We have worked out the details of this plan with experts and the Energy Ministry, the Finance Ministry, the oil companies and the Federal Customs Service. Under the new plan, 45% of difference (if the difference is positive) between the actual price of oil and the set price of $365 per tonne, or $50 per barrel, will go to the budget.
This approach is based on the principle of state support for private companies, primarily in order to encourage the development of new fields. This method will also enable the federal budget (within the current price range of $80 per barrel) to receive up to 35% of the revenue that would have been obtained by levying a 100% duty. The procedure will be introduced on July 1, provided that the current macroeconomic situation continues. Additional revenues for the budget could reach 11.9 billion roubles in 2010, 128.3 billion in 2011 and 207 billion roubles in 2012. Total revenues during this period could amount to 353.2 billion roubles. Once the internal revenue rate tops 16%, we plan to transition to a 100% customs duty. We would like to have your approval for this approach.
Vladimir Putin: Which means that you support the Finance Ministry?
Igor Sechin: This is a joint instruction.
Vladimir Putin: Agreed. We'll discuss this in more detail today. Mr Fursenko (addressing Minister of Education and ScienceAndrei Fursenko), we have reached an agreement on a new form of support for university science through subsidies to the companies that pay Russian institutes of higher education to carry out research and development. If I remember correctly, each individual subsidy should not exceed 100 million roubles. How is this project coming along?
Andrei Fursenko: Preparatory work has been completed, and in accordance with your instructions, the competitive process has begun to support scientific research at institutions of higher education. There are three interconnected approaches: first, as you said, subsidies to industrial companies; second, support for the infrastructure necessary for innovation at institutions ofhigher education; and third, inviting leading scientists - from Russia and other countries - to take part in research at our institutions of higher education and establish new departments. The preparatory work has been completed, and the competition has been announced. We have conducted a tentative survey and found that about 400 industrial companies have expressed an interest in taking part in these competitions. Yesterday we met with representatives from our leading institutions of higher education. About 70 of them were present, and not all of them were under my Ministry; for example, there were several from medical universities. We believe we will start giving out funding for this project in September. Projects have been planned for three years in all areas that will receive subsidies. We are talking about 300 million in subsidies over three years. At the same time, the companies will invest their own money and sign commitments to commercialise and utilise the solutions the universities develop.
Vladimir Putin: Thank you. Mr Mutko (addressing Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko), the FIFA World Cup is underway in South Africa. You have met with FIFA officials there. How is our bid for 2018 doing?
Vitaly Mutko: On June 10, on the eve of the World Cup, the 208-member International Football Federation held its congress. All nine countries that have placed bids for 2018 and 2022 were given an equal opportunity to make their presentations. We have made ours. Igor Shuvalov came for our presentation and we believe it was very successful.
Our booth and our bid attracted much attention. We secured meetings with the FIFA President, and we conveyed to him your message in which you wish success to the World Cup and reaffirm our commitment to meet all our obligations.
Australia has withdrawn its bid for 2018 and will now bid for 2022. And so there remains only one non-European country: the United States. But I think that they will change their bid for 2022 before the vote begins on December 2.
That leaves four European countries that have a real chance of hosting the 2018 World Cup.
Vladimir Putin: That's Spain, Portugal, Britain...
Vitaly Mutko: England, Belgium and the Netherlands - they made a joint bid - Spain, Portugal and Russia.
Overall, judging by the effect of the presentations and our meetings with members of the executive committee, Russia's bid has aroused much interest and enjoys significant support. At the next stage, several members of the executive committee would like to visit Russia in June and July to inspect construction sites.
The evaluation commission will be visiting Russia between August 16 and 19. They plan to tour four cities where preparations are now underway. And we'd like to ask you to meet with them.
And then we have the individual work, and in December the FIFA executive committee will make the final decision. On the whole, the World Cup leaves behind excellent facilities and a rich legacy. Very much has been done already: new stadiums, airports, railway terminals, roads and housing have been built, and it's quite impressive.
Vladimir Putin: Good, thank you.
Now let's move on to today's agenda. I'd like to touch on several issues. Today we'll consider several important issues, one of which I'd like to highlight. It is the Strategy for Geological Development up to 2030.
Russia is a world leader in its reserves of oil, natural gas, gold, diamonds, silver, copper, lead, iron ore and coal. This is our natural competitive advantage, which we must use, but use wisely. Ultimately, mining accounts for over 30% of the country's GDP.
Today geological exploration is a promising and attractive enterprise, where each rouble invested by the government attracts 10 roubles of private investment. In recent years proven reserves of strategic reserves, including oil, gas, gold and copper, have grown faster than the amount of these resources produced each year. This shows that we've resolved the problem we faced several years ago when we produced more than we developed, which caused certain problems and concerns. Today we can report that we have resolved the priority issues for exploration in this field.
Now we need to work for the future, creating the necessary conditions to supply Russian industries with raw materials for years ahead. In my opinion, this is the key objective of the Strategy we're considering today.
First, we need to more clearly define the areas of responsibility of the government and private business as far as reclaiming mineral reserves. Our general principle is that the state should fund geological prospecting at the initial stage and give private businesses the opportunity to conduct detailed research and develop particular fields and deposits at the next stages.
Second, we should ensure maximum access to public information resources, in particular by digitalising the so-called geological archives. I'd also like to remind you that the parliament passed a government-initiated law abolishing the fee for accessing minerals databases.
Third, it's necessary to eliminate excessive administrative barriers, which prevent small and medium-sized businesses from moving into this field. These companies could occupy a promising niche that is now empty. They could do research and prepare all the necessary information to develop small and medium-sized deposits in which large, vertically integrated companies have no interest.
Forth, today Russian geological prospecting is facing the fundamentally new challenges of large-scale surveying on the continental shelf, as well as developing ultra-deep deposits and mineral reserves in remote regions of the country. Therefore, it's necessary to pay special attention to the measures to improve geological prospecting technology, take advantage of innovative methods and cutting-edge equipment and launch advanced training programmes for personnel.
The next item of our agenda is one of the government's strategic projects: establishing a new innovative research centre at the Kurchatov Institute. This project will also allow us to retain and build on our competitive edge, carrying out research and development projects in key branches of modern science.
Today we'll consider and approve a joint research programme for the Kurchatov Institute and several other leading research centres, including the Konstantinov Nuclear Physics Institute, the Institute for High Energy Physics and the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics.
The programme contains several priority provisions, including the development of fundamental science and applied research in the energy industry, energy conservation, nanosystems and cutting-edge materials, which will allow us to develop breakthrough technologies that have practical application and are in demand in the market for innovation products.
This means next-generation nuclear reactors, systems for the safe disposal of radioactive waste, medical equipment and systems for treating cancer and other serious illnesses. This programme envisions sizeable investment in modernising scientific equipment, including accelerators and research reactors, as well as investment in training programmes.
This plan will lead to closer integration in higher education and involve talented young researchers. And of course, this programme will allow Russian scientists to be involved in large international projects on equal terms with their international partners. We'll allocate an additional 10 billion roubles for the Kurchatov Institute programme from 2010 through 2012, as we previously agreed.
Finally, in formulating new objectives for Russian science, we cannot forget the scientists who established its great traditions. Next year we'll celebrate the 100th birthday of one outstanding scientist, one of the founding fathers of the Russian space industry, Academician Mstislav Keldysh. These celebrations should be held nationwide. Today we'll also discuss this issue and make an appropriate decision.

Somalia Says Relations With Russia May Be Harmed Over Pirates' Treatment
May 20, 2010 8:00 PM
Somalia's Western-backed government says it still waiting for an apology from the Russian government for a recent incident in which Russian commandos set adrift captured Somali pirates hundreds of kilometers off the coast of Yemen with no navigation equipment.

Somalia's Information Ministry spokesman Abdirasak Aden tells VOA that diplomatic relations between the Transitional Federal Government and Russia may be harmed if the Russian government does not apologize to the Somali people for the incident at sea earlier this month.

Aden says Russia violated international human rights laws by casting suspected pirates adrift and not offering them the right to a fair trial. He says the Russian navy should have handed the suspects over to the Somali government for prosecution.

On the morning of May 5, a Russian destroyer was dispatched to rescue the crew of a hijacked Russian oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden.

When the pirates refused to give up the ship, Russian Special Forces stormed the tanker.

One pirate was reportedly killed and nearly a dozen others were captured. The pirates, mostly Somalis, were stripped of their weapons and set adrift in an inflatable raft, without any navigation equipment, about 560 kilometers off the coast of Yemen. The raft disappeared and the men are presumed to have drowned.

The Russian navy said it released the pirates because there were no legal grounds to prosecute them in Russia. Somali pirates insist Russian troops executed their colleagues and dumped their bodies in the raft before setting it adrift. The pirates' claim could not be independently verified.

Piracy off the coast of Somalia has been escalating since 2008, costing the international shipping industry more than $100 million a year in ransom payments and rising insurance premiums. Pirates are currently holding more than 20 vessels and nearly 400 crew members at various locations along the Somali coast.

An armada of ships from several dozen countries is patrolling the waters in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean to disrupt pirate activities. But once captured, prosecuting suspected pirates has been no easy task.

Somalia, which has not had a functioning central government for nearly 20 years, lacks an independent court system to try suspected pirates. Some suspects have been flown to Europe and the United States for trial. But most are sent to Kenya and the Seychelles, where pirate cases are piling up faster than the courts can process.

Last month, Kenya said it would not accept any more suspects for trial because its legal system was overburdened. Under pressure from the international community to reconsider, the Kenyan government agreed last week to resume prosecuting but only on a case-by-case basis.

Because of legal difficulties, an estimated 60 percent of suspected pirates are released before they reach shore.

Background

Pogroms Pogrom is a Russian word meaning “to wreak havoc, to demolish violently.” Historically, the term refers to violent attacks by local non-Jewish populations on Jews in the Russian Empire and in other countries. The first such incident to be labeled a pogrom

is believed to be anti-Jewish rioting in Odessa in 1821. As a descriptive term, “pogrom” came into common usage with extensive anti-Jewish riots that swept the southern and western provinces of the Russian Empire in 1881–1884, following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II.
The perpetrators of pogroms organized locally, sometimes with government and police encouragement. They raped and murdered their Jewish victims and looted their property. During the civil war that followed the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Ukrainian nationalists, Polish officials, and Red Army

soldiers all engaged in pogrom-like violence in western Belorussia (Belarus) and Poland's Galicia province (now West Ukraine), killing tens of thousands of Jews between 1918 and 1920.
The Kristallnacht Pogrom
Click here to copy a link to this section
In Germany and eastern Europe during the era of the Holocaust, as in Tsarist Russia, economic, social, and political resentment of Jews reinforced traditional religious antisemitism. This served as a pretext for pogroms.
After the Nazis seized power in Germany in 1933, Adolf Hitler publicly discouraged ""disorder"" and acts of violence. In practice, though, street violence against Jews was tolerated and even encouraged at certain periods when Nazi leaders calculated that the violence would “prepare” the German population for harsh antisemitic legal and administrative measures implemented ostensibly “to restore order.” For example, the orchestrated nationwide campaign of street violence known as Kristallnacht of November 9-10, 1938, was the culmination of a longer period of more sporadic street violence against Jews. This street violence had begun with riots in Vienna after the Anschluss of Austria in March.
Kristallnacht was followed by a dramatic surge in anti-Jewish legislation during the autumn and winter of 1938-1939. Another period of street violence had covered the first two months of the Nazi regime and culminated in a law dismissing Jews and Communists from the civil service on April 7, 1933. The summer before the announcement of the Nuremberg Race Laws in September 1935 saw frequent violence against Jews in various German cities. Such street violence involved burning down synagogues, destroying Jewish-owned homes and businesses, and physical assaults on individuals. Kristallnacht was by far the largest, most destructive, and most clearly orchestrated of these “pogroms.”
Pogroms World War II
Click here to copy a link to this section
During World War II, Einsatzgruppen (popularly known as mobile killing units) received orders from Security Police Chief Reinhard Heydrich to tolerate and even encourage the indigenous populations living in newly conquered Soviet territory in launching pogroms.
The pogroms (with varying degrees of spontaneity) in towns such as Bialystok, Kovno, Lvov, and Riga complemented the German policy of systematically eliminating entire Jewish communities in the Soviet Union. On June 29, 1941, as Nazi Germany and its Axis partner, Romania, invaded the Soviet Union, Romanian officials and military units, assisted at times by German soldiers, killed at least 8,000 Jews during a pogrom
View This Term in the Glossary
in Iasi, in the Romanian province of Moldavia. On July 10, 1941, Polish residents of Jedwabne, a small town located in Bialystok District of first Soviet-occupied and then German-occupied Poland, participated in the murder of hundreds of their Jewish neighbors. Although responsibility for instigating this “pogrom” has not been fully established, scholars have documented at least a German police presence in the town at the time of the killings.
By late summer of 1941, increasing instances of corruption, plunder, settling of old scores, destruction of important economic resources, and the infiltration of former communists into groups that perpetrated the “pogroms” led the German authorities to abandon the practice on the eastern front. German SS and police units purged hastily recruited auxiliary police units and began to carry out systematic and controlled massacres of entire Jewish communities in the occupied Soviet Union.
After the War

Although the Germans abandoned them as a tool of annihilation policy, pogroms did not end with World War II. In Kielce, Poland, local residents launched a pogrom

against surviving and returning Jews in the city on July 4, 1946. Mobs attacked Jews after false rumors spread that Jews had abducted a Christian child whom they intended to kill for ritual purposes. The rioters killed at least 42 Jews and wounded approximately 50 more.
The pogrom
View This Term in the Glossary
in Kielce was one of the factors that led to a mass westward migration of hundreds of thousands of Jews who had survived the Holocaust. Known as the Brihah, this movement brought Jews from Poland and other countries of eastern Europe to displaced persons camps located in the western zones of occupied Germany and Austria, and in Italy. A fear of violent pogroms was one motivation that led the vast majority of Jews to seek to leave postwar Europe.

On June 22, 1941, German forces invaded the Soviet Union. Three million German soldiers were reinforced by Finnish, Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, Slovak, and Croatian troops. Within weeks, German divisions conquered the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. In September the Germans laid siege to Sevastopol and Leningrad, and by late October, the cities of Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa, and Kharkov had fallen. Millions of Soviet soldiers were encircled, cut off from supplies and reinforcements, and forced to surrender.
Soviets Viewed as Subhuman Enemies
Click here to copy a link to this section
Yet for Nazi Germany this attack was not an ""ordinary"" military operation. The war against the Soviet Union was a war of annihilation between German fascism and Soviet communism; a racial war between German ""Aryans"" and subhuman Slavs and Jews. From the very beginning this war of annihilation against the Soviet Union included the killing of prisoners of war (POWs) on a massive scale. In part, German officials excused their ill treatment and murder of Soviet POWs by pointing out that the Soviet Union was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention and its soldiers did not warrant the protection that the convention extended to prisoners of war. In reality, their reasons were more complex. German authorities viewed Soviet POWs as a particular threat, regarding them not only as Slavic subhumans but as part of the ""Bolshevik menace"" linked in Nazi ideology to the concept of  a “Jewish conspiracy.”
Second Largest Group of Nazi Victims
Click here to copy a link to this section
The brutal treatment of Soviet POWs by the Germans violated every standard of warfare. Existing sources suggest that some 5.7 million Soviet army personnel fell into German hands during World War II. As of January 1945, the German army reported that only about 930,000 Soviet POWs remained in German custody. The German army released about one million Soviet POWs as auxiliaries of the German army and the SS. About half a million Soviet POWs had escaped German custody or had been liberated by the Soviet army as it advanced westward through eastern Europe into Germany. The remaining 3.3 million, or about 57 percent of those taken prisoner, were dead by the end of the war. Second only to the Jews, Soviet prisoners of war were the largest group of victims of Nazi racial policy.
Deliberate Policy
Click here to copy a link to this section
This death toll was neither an accident nor an automatic result of the war. It was a deliberate policy of the Nazi state. German treatment of Soviet POWs differed dramatically from German policy towards POWs from Britain and the United States, countries the Nazis regarded as racial equals to the Germans. Of the 231,000 British and American prisoners held by the Germans during the war only about 8,300—3.6 percent—died in German custody.

Transcript of the beginning of the meeting:
Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
Let's share the latest information first. Mr Kudrin will report on the progress made on the consolidated budgets of the Russian regions as of March 1.
Mr Kudrin, please begin.
Alexei Kudrin: Mr Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen,
In January and February both tax and non-tax revenues remained at last year's levels. Our projection has been correct so far: the revenue base in the Russian regions is holding steady from last year.
Profit tax revenues fell by 2%, while income tax revenues went up 3% in this period. Revenue from all other taxes increased by 16%, while non-tax revenue fell 16%. On the whole, revenues have remained at last year's levels, which means that the situation is stable.
Spending rose 9% during this period. Contracts were concluded and auctions were organised much more quickly, including at the federal level. Wages account for 37% of the overall spending. Investment expenditure remains at the same level. Regional governments invested a total of 37 billion roubles in construction and infrastructure in the first two months of 2010, which is slightly less, a 9% decline from the same period last year.
In total, regional budgets produced a 126 billion rouble surplus for these two months, which is even more than last year, when the surplus was 91 billion roubles.
Only six regions ran a budget deficit in this period, as opposed to ten regions last year. So, the number of regions with budgets in deficit fell during the first two months of this year.
Vladimir Putin: It fell by nearly half, right?
Alexei Kudrin: Yes, from ten to six. We will certainly continue to monitor the situation throughout the year. Current figures show that the situation is stable, and budgets are in surplus. We are supporting this trend through transfers and subsidies from the federal budget. Regional governments have been coping with most of their tasks.
Vladimir Putin: Good, thank you. I introduced to the State Duma the draft law On the Russian Federation's Policy on Compatriots Living Abroad, which was prepared by the government. Mr Lavrov, could you please tell our colleagues more about this draft law and share your comments.
Sergei Lavrov: The Government Commission on Compatriots Living Abroad, which I chair, reviewed the current law. It was passed in 1999, when our capabilities and other factors limited our focus to providing humanitarian aid to our compatriots who found themselves in a difficult situation.
This law has not kept up with the changes of the past 10 years, the more dynamic modern system and Russia's policy with respect to our compatriots abroad. A number of the provisions of the older law are obsolete and need to be updated.
Essentially, the new law seeks to deepen interactions and equal partnership between Russians abroad and Russia. At the same time, we will continue to provide humanitarian aid when necessary. The law is aimed at consolidating Russian communities abroad, protecting their rights and legitimate interests in compliance with the norms of international law, as approved by the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and other organisations.
This law also emphasises the preservation of the Russian ethnic and cultural landscape, including the Russian language. To this end, the law suggests enlisting the support of the federal government, regional governments and Russian non-government alliances.
The draft law has been approved by all the necessary bodies. Now that we have signed the relevant documents and the draft law has been introduced in the State Duma, we will request that parliament consider it a priority.
Vladimir Putin: Good. A government executive order has been signed to distribute Government Awards in Science and Technology. There are 40 awards, each worth one million roubles. Mr Zhukov, what more can tell us about this issue?
Alexander Zhukov: Correct, there are 40 awards, including 10 awards in the fields of defence and security. These awards were initiated by the Interdepartmental Council on Presenting Government Awards. A total of 292 people will receive awards for 2009, including 19 full members and 12 associate members of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Medical Sciences and other academies.
I would like to emphasise that these awards are given for accomplishments in R&D projects that have resulted in the creation and large-scale application of new-generation technology, devices, equipment and materials. Naturally, these achievements have already been put into practice.
I would like to highlight some of them, for example, innovative solutions in healthcare, the research project to develop a unique spherical thermonuclear unit, and technologies to make textile production more competitive.
Vladimir Putin: And let's add that the recipients of these awards live in different regions, not only in Moscow and St Petersburg.
Alexander Zhukov: Yes, there are recipients from 21 different regions.
Vladimir Putin: Those 21 regions include Udmurtia, the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the Kemerovo Region, the Kaluga Region, the Tula Region, the Tyumen Region and others. Alright.
We also approved a resolution on federal funding, on budget financing for the design and construction of another state-of-the-art medical centre in the city of Dimitrovgrad in the Ulyanovsk Region. Total funding is 13.9 billion roubles, with half a billion for the design alone. Please comment on this resolution, Mrs Golikova.
Tatiana Golikova: Mr Putin, colleagues, these are fundamentally new technologies. This is a state-of-the-art radiology centre. We made an agreement last year with the Ministry of Economic Development. It will be a pilot centre of sorts, and it meets all the criteria for the most modern medical technology. And having completed the design work in 2009, we can now start to build in 2010.
This year, 1.5 billion roubles have been allocated through the federal investment programme, and by 2013 (2012 is the last year of the project) we plan to open this centre.
We're entering a completely new stage, which is based on the fact that we are basically the leader in nuclear medicine now and we have the know-how to effectively treat oncological diseases with the aid of nuclear technology.
A proton centre designated for proton radiation therapy is planned for the centre. This technique allows us to treat tumours in the most difficult-to-reach places without damaging other tissues and organs that are damaged using conventional chemotherapy.
These technologies are only used sporadically in oncological centres, and if we are talking about radionuclide therapy, it is used sporadically in Obninsk and helps just 3% of those currently in need of such medical services.
As for Dimitrovgrad, the choice of this venue was no accident. As you know, it is not far from the Rosatom facility - the Nuclear Reactors Research Institute (NIIAR), which produces all known radioisotopes, which are the basis for all radiopharmaceutical tracers. And last year, when we were designing this centre, we established the necessary cooperation with NIIAR, from the point of view of producing these radioisotopes and processing the corresponding radiopharmaceutical tracers in this newly created medical centre for treatment not only in the centre itself but in nearby clinics that have nuclear medicine departments.
The centre can hold 460 beds. Treatment time ranges from 7 to 10 days, and this is directly associated with the technology being used, which I mentioned. And after applying these technologies, particularly if the illness is in its early stages, those receiving medical care will be able to return to work in about a week and return to a normal life.
The annual volume of medical care provided in this centre will be around 40,000 patients in need of such care. And of course, this will considerably reduce the incidence of oncological diseases, the mortality rate and, most importantly, neglect of this type of illness.
Of course, one centre is not enough for the entire Russian Federation. There is, of course, your directive to open centres in Obninsk and Tomsk. But considering that they are rather expensive, we are engaged in a constructive discussion with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development regarding a possible construction timeframe for these centres. And, as I already mentioned, we need three of these centres in order to fully meet the demand of the population of the Russian Federation for this modern, state-of-the-art technology.
Vladimir Putin: We allocated money last year for the same centre, did we not?
Tatiana Golikova: We did indeed allocate money for Dimitrovgrad and the design work.
Vladimir Putin: In 2009?
Tatiana Golikova: Yes.
Vladimir Putin: Good. And it was selected specifically because there is a good technological base there?
Tatiana Golikova: Yes. There is a very good technological base there. The NIIAR is right next door. And it is very important that the Ulyanovsk Region itself is encouraged to establish a university town around this centre because this technology will require training for specialists - nuclear physicists and chemists.
We opened two university departments - one in Ulyanovsk and the other at the Obninsk Medical Institute - in order to train the necessary specialists, and by the time the centre opens, these specialists will be ready to begin work there.
Vladimir Putin: I understand, thank you.
Sports fans know that the day before yesterday CSKA pleased football fans with a good game and a win in the Champions League. This is an occasion for us to remember Russia's bid to host the World Cup in 2018.
A bid book must be put together before May 14 of this year. The relevant commission from FIFA plans to come to Moscow in August, and the decision itself will be made in December of this year in Zurich. How is the work coming along?
Igor Shuvalov: Mr Putin, last March Russia made an official request to FIFA to be considered to host the World Cup either in 2018 or 2022. The bidding process is different now, as FIFA decided to accept bids for both championship matches at once, so bidder countries can form coalitions.
We submitted the necessary papers to FIFA in March 2009. In October, you established the organising committee. The bid committee and its oversight council were also established.
Headed by Sport and Tourism Minister Vitaly Mutko, the oversight council includes business tycoons who promote our bid both as sponsors and as football fans.
They are all active in international events. In fact, they have taken all the preparations upon themselves to support our bid later.
As we have said, we are preparing the bid book, which FIFA must receive by May 14. It takes a large team of experts to handle this big job, which consists of a thousand pages spread out over three volumes.
The evaluation committee will start work in August to check every part of Russia. We are ready to receive the committee in all bidder regions. At present, we are working with thirteen cities that want to host the World Cup and are prepared to develop their sport facilities. The committee will either visit all of them or certain ones at their discretion. The success of our work largely depends on how well cities and regions do their work.
We are coordinating work with regions now. And I'd like to emphasise that the responsibility is not only national but also municipal, meaning the cities that want to host the Wold Cup. Regional governors also share this responsibility.
We will have time to prepare the bid presentation after the evaluation committee finishes its work. We need to be ready to give the presentation in Zurich on December 2. High officials from bidder countries usually take part in the presentations.
Mr Putin, you have received a personal invitation to participate. Everyone remembers your work on behalf of our Olympic bid for Sochi 2014. FIFA representatives mentioned it when I met with them, and they hope you will attend.
Work is going according to schedule, and we are complying with FIFA's requirements. There is a problem, however: Russia's sports infrastructure is not on a par with other bidders, and it is standard practice for a bidder country to offer eight standard guarantees regarding infrastructure.
But since Russia doesn't have stadiums of the appropriate class, FIFA insists on an additional government guarantee in case Russian entrepreneurs and regions are unable to create the necessary infrastructure.
We are discussing the matter with the Ministry of Finance now. When ready, we intend to add it to the agenda of a government meeting or a presidium meeting. Mr Kudrin [finance minister], Ms Nabiullina of the Ministry of Economic Development, and I will complete this work in the next ten days.
We will not start our work with the evaluation commission until we obtain government guarantees and settle all the formalities.
Vladimir Putin: It would be better to start working with the commission right away, without waiting for papers to be drawn up. At any rate, you are on schedule?
Igor Shuvalov: Yes.
Vladimir Putin: Good. Now, let us turn to our agenda.
Today we will evaluate the prospects of Russian economic relations with its key partners, meaning the 38 countries that account for 80% of our foreign trade. We are interested in closer trade and investment ties and greater cooperation with these countries.
These countries include such time-tested partners as the CIS countries, Germany, Egypt, India, Italy, the Netherlands, China, the United States, Turkey, Finland, France and Japan, as well as Brazil, Venezuela and other countries with which we have recently begun to expand our business partnership.
Let me emphasise that we have a solid foundation for successful teamwork with each of these countries. This foundation includes bilateral agreements on taxation and investment protection. More importantly, we have mutual confidence and respect for each other's interests.
I believe this approach will yield significant results, as evidenced by our relations with India.
As you know, during the recent visit to New Delhi we, along with our Indian colleagues, noted the unprecedented level of economic cooperation and integration between our countries. From simple trade, India and Russia have moved on to joint projects and a deep partnership even in such sensitive sectors as nuclear energy and defence.
Our relations with Finland, our northern neighbour, provide another example. A case in point: the Russian government takes current global economic problems into consideration and so has shelved the plan to introduce prohibitive rough timber export duties. And we are grateful to our Finnish partners for meeting us halfway on a range of issues.
Our primary goal is to integrate Russia into the global economic system in a way that makes sense and to create the conditions necessary to benefit from our competitive advantages.
We would like to develop fair and mutually beneficial trade relations with all countries, rooted in pragmatism and free of political bias, discrimination and double standards. These are the principles on which we seek to expand cooperation in international business.
Our agenda for today also includes a review of the results of last year's federal target programmes.
This review is necessary to make government investments more effective in the future and so that we can make deliberate and informed decisions on next year's budget priorities.
Let's begin our discussion.

Abstract
Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) and short bowel syndrome (SBS) patients are unable to absorb vitamin D from the diet and thus are frequently found to be severely vitamin D deficient. We evaluated whether a commercial portable ultraviolet (UV) indoor tanning lamp that has a spectral output that mimics natural sunlight could raise circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in subjects with CF and SBS.
Methods
In initial pilot studies, two SBS subjects came to the outpatient clinic twice weekly for 8 weeks for UV light sessions of 6 min each. In a follow-up study, five CF subjects exposed their lower backs in a seated position to the sunlamp at a distance of 14 cm for 5–10 min depending on the skin type five times a week for 8 weeks. Blood samples for 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurements were performed at baseline and at the end of the study.
Results
In our study, with two SBS subjects, the indoor lamp increased or maintained circulating 25(OH)D levels during the winter months. We increased the UV lamp frequency and found an improved response in the CF patients. Serum 25(OH)D levels in CF subjects at baseline were 21 ± 3 ng/ml, which increased to 27 ± 4 ng/ml at the end of 8 weeks (P = 0.05). PTH concentration remained largely unchanged in both population groups.
Conclusion
A UV lamp that emits ultraviolet radiation similar to sunlight and thus produces vitamin D3 in the skin is an excellent alternative for CF, and SBS patients who suffer from vitamin D deficiency due to fat malabsorption, especially during the winter months when natural sunlight is unable to produce vitamin D3 in the skin. This UV lamp is widely available for commercial home use and could potentially be prescribed to patients with CF or SBS.
Keywords: cystic fibrosis, short bowel syndrome, tanning, ultraviolet radiation, vitamin D
Vitamin D is an important nutrient for intestinal calcium absorption for optimal skeletal health. Vitamin D can either be ingested from the diet (vitamin D2 or D3) or produced in the skin (D3). Vitamin D (vitamin D2 or D3) absorption from the diet occurs primarily in the duodenum and jejunum (1, 2). Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the form of vitamin D that can be produced endogenously in the skin following ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (3). After production in the skin, vitamin D3 is converted to the major circulating form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3). Circulating 25(OH)D3 is then converted to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by the kidney 1-α-hydroxylase to act as a steroid hormone to increase the efficiency of calcium absorption primarily in the duodenum to maintain proper serum calcium levels for skeletal health and other cellular signaling processes (3).
Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in most healthy individuals is accomplished by giving vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) 50 000 IU once or twice a week for several weeks (4). However, patients with malabsorption as in short-bowel syndrome (SBS) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are not able to absorb vitamin D efficiently and thus have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, leading to osteomalacia and osteoporosis. SBS patients have been given high-dose oral vitamin D supplementation without an improvement in vitamin D status due to poor intestinal absorption of vitamin D (1, 5, 6). CF patients have inefficient vitamin D absorption due to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency resulting in malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D. CF subjects absorb approximately 50% less vitamin D compared with what normal subjects absorb, depending on the degree of exocrine insufficiency (7). Current guidelines in CF patients to treat vitamin D deficiency with weekly high-dose ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) have been ineffective (8–10). Despite 50 000 IU of ergocalciferol once a week for a total of 16 weeks in vitamin D-deficient CF patients, all of the patients remained vitamin D deficient (10).
Because patients with fat malabsorption syndromes cannot efficiently absorb vitamin D from the diet, an alternative method to raise vitamin D status, especially during the winter months where vitamin D cannot be made (11), would be by exposing the skin to UVB produced by a device to produce vitamin D3 cutaneously (1, 12). Indoor tanning machines emit the same spectrum UVB radiation as sunlight (13). Studies evaluating indoor tanning beds have demonstrated that 25(OH)D levels can be raised after exposure to lamps that emit UVB (14). Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that subjects who use an indoor tanning bed at least once a week have higher 25(OH)D levels than control subjects, which correlates with a higher bone mineral density (BMD) (13). Koutkia et al (1) successfully treated vitamin D deficiency, and associated musculoskeletal pains in a subject with SBS with the use of an indoor tanning bed.
In the current study, we sought to evaluate whether a commercially available portable desktop tanning machine could improve vitamin D status in patients with SBS and CF, disorders characterized by chronic malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

Methods
Evaluation of a portable tanning machine to make vitamin D
To determine whether we could use a tanning device to improve vitamin D status in patients with malabsorption, we initially tested a commercially available desktop tanning machine to determine whether the UVB radiation emitted from the machine could convert 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) (pro-vitamin D3), the compound naturally present in skin, to pre-vitamin D3. We obtained the Sperti Del Sol portable tanning machine from KBD Inc. (Crescent Springs, KY, USA). The UVB output of this machine overlaps with the region of UVB necessary for vitamin D production in the skin (290–315 nm) (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1
Ultraviolet spectrum output of the Sperti Del Sol sunlamp used in the study.
We exposed ampules containing a known quantity of 7-DHC to the machine at several distances and times to determine the quantity of pre-vitamin D conversion from 7-DHC. We determined the resultant amount of vitamin D3 by standard high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods, as described by Holick et al. (15).
We determined that the portable tanning machine could effectively convert 7-DHC to pre-vitamin D3 (Fig. 2). At several distances and times, from 0.5% to 5.0% of pre-vitamin D3 could be detected in the ampules. Control ampules that had not been exposed to the tanning device did not demonstrate detectable pre-vitamin D3. These data provided necessary preclinical data to proceed with our pilot study to evaluate the use of the portable tanning machine in CF and SBS patients with malabsorption. Based on these data, we developed a protocol to expose patients to UVB light via the tanning machine for up to 10 min at a distance of 14 inches.
Fig. 2
Percentage of pre-vitamin D3 formed after exposing ampules containing 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to a portable tanning machine at several times and distances (◆, 14 inches; ■, 20 inches; ▲, 26 inches). Ampules containing 7-DHC (pro-vitamin D) were exposed to a portable tanning machine at several distances and times to determine the optimal conditions for vitamin D production in the skin. Vitamin D production was optimal at 14 cm from the device and an exposure time between 10 and 15 min.
Evaluation of a tanning machine to improve vitamin D status in two patients with severe SBS
Subjects We obtained Emory University IRB approval to study the effect of the Sperti Del Sol sunlamp (Cresent Springs, KY, USA) in two SBS subjects with chronic, severe diarrhea and vitamin D insufficiency [25(OH)D <30 ng/ml], who both had failed oral courses of vitamin D therapy to improve vitamin D status. The first subject was a 49-year-old woman with 50 cm of the bowel remaining after massive small bowel and partial colonic resection secondary to mesenteric ischemia. The subject required parenteral nutrition (PN) solution 7 nights/week with 200 IU/day of vitamin D3 to maintain nutritional status. Her left femoral neck bone density was 2.4 standard deviations below the peak density, and she had subjective pain and malaise. The second SBS subject was a 54-year-old woman who had multiple small bowel resections for a strangulated hernia in whom the distal duodenum was anastomosed to the right transverse colon. The subject also required PN solution 7 nights/week with 200 IU/day of vitamin D3 to maintain nutritional status. Like the first subject, she suffered from severe night cramps and bone pains.
Study protocol in SBS patients The study was conducted in the months from March to May. The two SBS subjects came to the outpatient clinic twice weekly for 8 weeks for the UV light sessions, which were administered by the study team. After baseline blood studies were obtained, both subjects started at an initial exposure time of 3 min from a distance of 14 inches to the exposed skin on the lower back in a seated position; the time was increased by 1 min to reach a target time of 6 min per UV light session in accordance with their skin type (Appendix A). The skin was inspected before and after each session to examine for any burns. Subjects gave a blood sample for 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) determinations every 4 weeks until the end of the study. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed in this pilot study in SBS patients.
Vitamin D status and PTH Commercially available ELISA kits were used to measure 25(OH)D (IDS Ltd., Fountain Hills, AZ, USA), and intact PTH (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA) in blood samples at baseline and after 8 weeks of use of the tanning lamp.

Results
The first subject with SBS demonstrated a baseline serum 25(OH)D of 13 ng/ml that increased by 70% to 21 ng/ml at 4 weeks, and plateaued at this level after 8 weeks of UVB therapy. The serum PTH levels in this individual increased slightly from 150 to 165 pg/ml at the end of 8 weeks. There was a subjective reduction in the severity of her night cramps and bone pains. The second SBS subject demonstrated a baseline serum 25(OH)D of 17 ng/ml that increased by 40% to 24 ng/ml at 2 weeks, but then decreased to baseline levels (16 ng/ml) after 8 weeks of study. Her serum PTH levels decreased from 130 to 58 pg/ml at the end of 8 weeks.
Adverse events
Both subjects tolerated the monitored radiation sessions without any adverse events.
Evaluation of a tanning machine to improve vitamin D status during the winter months in subjects with CF Subjects We obtained Emory University IRB approval to study the effect of the Sperti Del Sol sunlamp in CF patients with documented vitamin D insufficiency. The target population for the study was CF subjects cared for by the Emory Cystic Fibrosis Center (Atlanta, GA). Subjects were recruited by posted advertisements and referral by physicians. Subjects gave written informed consent for participation in the study. We included subjects older than 18 years of age who had documented vitamin D insufficiency [serum 25(OH)D <30 ng/ml] within the last three months, and had a history of gastrointestinal malabsorption documented by requirement of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy or long-term PN therapy, or who had a skin sensitivity types II–VI (Appendix A). We excluded those subjects who had a history of photosensitivity, a history of active skin disease or any history of skin cancer, who were taking medications that limit sunlight exposure (such as tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones), who were taking more than 1000 IU vitamin D or vitamin D analogs daily orally, who had evidence of liver or kidney failure, who had fair skin type I (Appendix A), who were undergoing tanning sessions or subjects who were pregnant.
Study protocol Based on the promising, but sub-optimal increase in serum 25(OH)D in these two pilot subjects with severe SBS, we increased the frequency of exposure to the tanning device to five times a week for the same time period of 8 weeks in the subsequent study in CF patients. The study period was from November to February. Subjects had a baseline 24-hour dietary recall and sunlight exposure questionnaire, and a baseline blood sample for the measurement of serum 25(OH)D and PTH. Subjects completed five UV light sessions per week for 8 weeks at home. Goggles for eye protection to be worn during the sessions were given. The target time per session was based on skin type (Appendix A). The subjects were asked to start with 3 min/session and to increase the time by 1 min/week till their target time. Subjects were instructed to expose the skin of the lower back to the tanning machine in a seated position from a distance of 14 in. Subjects came to the outpatient clinic every 2 weeks to for examination of the skin, and blood was drawn at 0 and 8 weeks for serum 25(OH)D and PTH mesurements.
Dietary history Twenty-four hours of food recall was recorded for the day just before the first visit to the clinic. The dietary questionnaire had food portions that were visually quantified and standardized for the subject quantification. ESHA's The Food Processor SQL Version 9.8 Software was used to analyze the dietary intake.
Vitamin D status and PTH We used the same commercially available ELISA kits that were used to measure 25(OH)D and intact PTH as in our pilot study of SBS subjects.
Statistical analysis The results were represented as means ± SEM. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Office 2000), and Sigma Stat Version 3.0. Differences in the concentrations of serum total 25(OH)D were evaluated using a two-way paired t-test. Intention to treat was used in data analysis.

Discussion
This pilot study demonstrates that a portable tanning device emitting UVB could maintain or improve vitamin D status in patients with CF or SBS during the winter months. Studies in SBS patients helped to define the UVB dose chosen for the CF study. In CF subjects, all were vitamin D deficient, despite taking regular vitamin D supplementation, due to malabsorption. During the winter, 8 weeks of the Sperti sunlamp resulted in a 25% increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration, and the prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency [defined as 25(OH)D <20 ng/ml] decreased from 60% to 20%. All subjects demonstrated an increase in serum 25(OH)D concentrations, which achieved statistical significance. Similar results were found in the early pilot study in two SBS subjects. The use of a desktop tanning unit was well tolerated and no significant adverse events were reported by either group.
Sunlight, in particular UVB between the wavelengths of 290 and 315 nm, is the main source for producing vitamin D in the skin and is the primary source of vitamin D for the body. It is estimated that 90% of the daily body requirements are met by sunlight exposure (16, 17). One minimal erythemal dose (MED) of UVB exposure to 6% of the body surface area is equivalent to the ingestion of 600–1000 IU of vitamin D (18). Thus, exposure of the hands, face and arms two to three times a week is sufficient to meet the daily body vitamin D requirements in most individuals during the spring, summer and fall (18). Owing to the zenith angle of the sun during the winter months, very little UVB penetrates the earth above 351 latitudes, and thus sunlight exposure at this time will not result in sufficient vitamin D production (19, 20). For example, a third of healthy adults living in Boston were demonstrated to be vitamin D deficient at the end of winter (21).
In areas where there is limited sunlight or in situations where patients cannot absorb vitamin D from the diet, phototherapy using UV light has been used to correct vitamin D deficiency. In the early 20th century, mercury arc lamps were used to treat children with rickets in Russia. Indoor beds or tanning devices have been reported to be an effective alternative method to maintain or raise vitamin D status especially during the winter months in individuals with malabsorption (1, 22). Subjects who use an indoor tanning bed at least once a week have 150% higher 25(OH)D levels at the end of winter and higher BMD than matched healthy controls (13). Several other studies have used UVB from artificial sources in raising body vitamin D status (23–28).
Vitamin D insufficiency and metabolic bone disease remains a major health problem in patients with CF. The cause for decreased bone density in CF is multifactorial; however, due to the inability to absorb fat soluble vitamins, vitamin D insufficiency is a major contributing factor (8). Serum 25(OH)D in CF patients is positively correlated with BMD (29). A recent Johns Hopkins Hospital study found 109 out of 134 CF adults in the clinic to be vitamin D deficient [serum 25(OH)D <30 ng/ml], and none of the 33 CF subjects who finished 1 200 000 IU of oral vitamin D2 over 4 months showed correction in their vitamin D status (10). The CF consensus guidelines for bone health suggest the use of UV lamps in subjects who fail to achieve optimal vitamin D status; however, no standard protocols have been established (8). A recent case–control study from Sweden demonstrated that CF subjects exposed to UV lamps one to three times weekly for 6 months showed an increase in circulating 25(OH)D from 20 to 50 ng/ml (27).
One of the weaknesses of our study is that we did not have randomized control subjects during the same months. Our small sample size also limits the power of our data analysis; however, the study subjects were exposed to the tanning light for just 8 weeks, which significantly increased their serum vitamin D levels by 25%. However, the values failed to reach the newly established levels to define vitamin D insufficiency [25(OH)D >32 ng/ml] (30). This suggests that the protocol may need to be extended for a longer time. Also, during this limited timeframe, we failed to show a significant decline in serum PTH concentration. Another limitation was that compliance could not be well assured in our second study with CF subjects because of the use of the tanning device at home.
In summary, we found that a portable tanning device used for tanning could be used to improve vitamin D status in selected individuals with intestinal malabsorption of vitamin D. Eight weeks of exposure to the sunlamp increased circulating 25(OH)D levels by 25% and reduced the prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency. Further research is needed to determine the optimal duration of UVB exposure and to determine the long-term benefits of correcting vitamin D status by UVB on musculoskeletal health in these at-risk patients.

SYNOPSIS
The American military experience in World War I and the influenza pandemic were closely intertwined. The war fostered influenza in the crowded conditions of military camps in the United States and in the trenches of the Western Front in Europe. The virus traveled with military personnel from camp to camp and across the Atlantic, and at the height of the American military involvement in the war, September through November 1918, influenza and pneumonia sickened 20% to 40% of U.S. Army and Navy personnel. These high morbidity rates interfered with induction and training schedules in the United States and rendered hundreds of thousands of military personnel non-effective. During the American Expeditionary Forces' campaign at Meuse-Argonne, the epidemic diverted urgently needed resources from combat support to transporting and caring for the sick and the dead. Influenza and pneumonia killed more American soldiers and sailors during the war than did enemy weapons.
In the fall of 1918, U.S. Army and Navy medical officers in camps across the country presided over the worst epidemic in American history, but the story was not new. War and disease have been linked throughout history as armies, weapons, and human pathogens have met on the battlefield. The conquistadores brought with them diseases that devastated the New World; typhus plagued Napoleon's armies; and typhoid fever humiliated the American Army during the Spanish-American War. But now U.S. Army and Navy personnel knew how to test and sanitize water supplies, vaccinate troops against typhoid and smallpox, and treat or prevent other infections. Modern bacteriology, it seemed, had tamed many diseases. Navy Surgeon General William C. Braisted proudly stated that “infectious diseases that formerly carried off their thousands, such as yellow fever, typhus, cholera, and typhoid, have all yielded to our modern knowledge of their causes and our consequent logical measures taken for their prevention.”1
Twentieth-century warfare, however, had evolved to an even more deadly scale as industrialized armies of millions battled on the plains of Eastern Europe, the cliffs of Gallipoli, and in the deadly trenches of the 550-mile-long Western Front. When the European arms race exploded into war in 1914, the empires shocked themselves and the world with the killing power of their artillery and machine guns, their U-boats and mines, and their poison gas. These new weapons generated new, horrible injuries that took life and limb in a flash or festered into gangrenous wounds that could further maim and kill. The carnage traumatized some men into shellshock, and poison gases burned and suffocated others so horribly that nurses dreaded caring for them because they could provide little comfort. War diseases—notably the soldiers' nemeses diarrhea, dysentery, and typhus—flourished, and the trenches offered new maladies such as “trench foot,” an infection caused by wearing sodden boots and standing in water and mud for days on end, and “trench fever,” a debilitating fever transmitted by body lice.
Then, in the fourth dreadful year of the war, as the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) assumed fighting strength and prepared their first great offensive against the Germans, the flu struck. By the War Department's most conservative count, influenza sickened 26% of the Army—more than one million men—and killed almost 30,000 before they even got to France.2,3 On both sides of the Atlantic, the Army lost a staggering 8,743,102 days to influenza among enlisted men in 1918.4 (p. 1448) The Navy recorded 5,027 deaths and more than 106,000 hospital admissions for influenza and pneumonia out of 600,000 men, but given the large number of mild cases that were never recorded, Braisted put the sickness rate closer to 40%.5,6 (p. 2458)
The Army and Navy medical services may have tamed typhoid and typhus, but more American soldiers, sailors, and Marines would succumb to influenza and pneumonia than would die on the industrialized battlefields of the Great War. The story of the influenza epidemic in the military is often lost in the historical narrative of the Great War, included merely as a coda to that four-year horror, coinciding with the final battles and the Armistice. But an examination of medical reports and War Department and Department of the Navy documents from the war reveals that the war and the epidemic were intertwined.7 World War I and influenza collaborated: the war fostered disease by creating conditions in the trenches of France that some epidemiologists believe enabled the influenza virus to evolve into a killer of global proportions. In turn, disease shaped the war effort by rendering much of the Army and Navy non-effective and diverting resources, personnel, and scarce human attention and energy from the military campaign. The exigencies of war also thwarted many of the efforts such as crowd mitigation and quarantines to control the epidemic. The influenza epidemic in the U.S. military therefore provides a cautionary tale about the power of war to change the health environment and the power of disease to influence the conduct of war.

GOING TO WAR
The United States at first hung back from the killing in Europe, as many Americans believed it was not their fight. But under increasing pressure from Britain and France, and angered by German U-boat attacks that threatened American commerce and security, and the revelations in the Zimmermann Telegram that Germany was urging Mexico to attack the United States, President Wilson abandoned neutrality and in April 1917 asked Congress for a declaration of war.
The U.S. economy was already booming as farmers and manufacturers shipped foodstuffs and military supplies to the belligerent nations. Now the United States would also generate its own military force that would help overwhelm the enemy and bring about the armistice of November 11, 1918. Congress quickly established a draft, and more than 4,600 Selective Service draft boards screened 10 million men to find the strongest and most fit soldiers and sailors. The military grew from just 378,000 strong in April 1917 to more than 4.7 million by war's end, with an Army of 4.1 million and a Navy of 600,000. Seventy-two percent of enlisted forces were inducted, and the military population reflected the country's ethnically diverse and racially segregated society. An estimated 20% of Army draftees were foreign-born and the troops spoke at least 46 languages, some 5,700 were Mexican aliens, and 12,500 were American Indians.8 (p. 367-409) More than 400,000 African Americans served in the Army, some in two black combat divisions but most in labor battalions. The Navy employed only 5,300 black sailors, confining them to positions as cooks and stewards.9
War mobilization drew millions of civilians into military institutions and extended the military into all corners of the country. To train and supply these men, the Army and Navy expanded existing facilities and directed training activities at various civilian organizations. Military camps, arsenals, air fields, and supply depots sprouted up in every state. The Army began training recruits in the fall of 1917 at 32 large camps, each home to 25,000 to 55,000 troops. Soldiers also went to specialized camps for training in specific fields such as artillery training at Camp Knox, Kentucky, railway operations at Camp Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis, military engineering at Camp Forrest, Georgia, and medical unit training at Camp Crane, Pennsylvania. The War Department also operated some 40 air fields for aviator training and 10 embarkation and debarkation camps.8 (p. 677-–78) The Navy expanded its training capacity from 6,000 recruits to more than 100,000 at stations on both coasts, the Gulf of Mexico, and Lake Michigan, and also had specialized training centers such as the Navy gas engine school and the aviation ignition school at Columbia University in New York. In addition to the training camps, in the summer of 1918 the War Department established the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), intended to augment the work of the Reserve Officers Training Corp (ROTC) and prevent war mobilization from emptying institutions of higher education. Under the program, more than 500 colleges and universities trained officer candidates and provided technical instruction in fields such as auto mechanics and radio operation. By the Armistice, about 158,000 young men had enrolled in SATC programs.8 (p. 556) This expansion of military institutions created a virtual network of young adults across which influenza could and would travel (Figure 1).

As the Army grew, the Army Medical Department raced to meet its needs. Military medicine was more like public health medicine (which managed large populations) than private medicine (which focused on care for individuals). By necessity, line officers cared less about who was sick or on leave than who they could send into battle. This was called the “effective” rate—how many men were available in a given unit to work and fight. Medical officers therefore tried to keep non-effective rates as low as possible, and measured their success statistically more than by individual patient care. The Army Medical Department tracked sickness in camps, combat units, labor battalions, ports, and ships by the day, week, month, and year, and compared its record with civilians, earlier wars, and other armies. Army Medicine also combined the old sanitation model of clean water and fresh air with the new public health approaches of educating soldiers on how to stay healthy and prevent disease. Army Surgeon General William C. Gorgas came out of the sanitary tradition and stressed good food, clean water, fresh air, and no crowding, but like other Progressives, also saw the Army as an opportunity to instill young men with middle-class values such as good personal hygiene.10
To care for the growing Army, the Medical Department increased its hospital capacity from 9,500 beds to 120,000 in the United States alone. The Red Cross assisted by recruiting trained nurses for the Army Nurse Corps and organizing ambulance companies and 50 hospitals of 1,000 beds each out of American universities and medical institutions. The Army Medical Department ultimately numbered 30,500 medical officers, 21,500 nurses—including 350 African American physicians but no black nurses until December 1918—and 264,000 enlisted men.8 (p. 257) The Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery had some 3,000 medical officers, 1,700 nurses, and 11,000 enlisted men.5 (p. 2066, 2073) As one civilian public health official pointed out, with almost 30% of American physicians in military service, “…there were sections of the country that were absolutely stripped of physicians.” During the pandemic in civil society, therefore, “…the great majority of available, medical and nursing personnel, were already in the Army or Navy, so that the available personnel from which to draw was limited.”11
World War I was largely a ground war, so the Army bore the brunt of the fighting. While some 55,000 Marines served with the AEF, most of the Navy's responsibilities involved patrolling for U-boats, sweeping for enemy mines, escorting troop and cargo ships across the Atlantic, and mining the North Sea against the German Navy. Mobilization got off to a slow start in the United States, and a year after the declaration of war, the AEF in Europe numbered fewer than 400,000. By May 1918, however, hundreds of thousands of soldiers were crossing the Atlantic each month to build a combat force of two million by November. This transport of an army to another continent and back was one of the great achievements of World War I and demonstrated the power of the American government and economy. But such triumph also carried danger because as the doughboys traveled “Over There,” they did not travel alone.

A LETHAL VIRUS
Influenza sailed with American troops across the Atlantic and when it exploded in late August and September in Europe and the United States, medical officers found themselves on the front lines of an epidemic worse than any of them had ever seen or imagined. Many were among the most knowledgeable and skilled physicians in the country and had just recently entered military service. They did their best to save those stricken by influenza, but could do little more than provide palliative care of warmth, rest, and a gentle diet, and hope that their patients did not develop pneumonia.
One of the tragedies of the influenza epidemic is that by the 1910s, the medical profession held many of the scientific and epidemiological tools to understand the nature and extent of the damage influenza and pneumonia were wreaking on their patients, but lacked the tools to effectively fight them. While virology would not emerge until the 1930s, physicians could identify many of the bacteria causing the deadly pneumonias that were killing their patients, but without antibiotics they could do little to fight the infections. Thus, as the epidemic struck their camps, hospitals, ships, ports, or divisions, many medical officers documented what they saw, as if trying to define that which they could not control. They ran tests and did autopsies, recorded their laboratory and clinical findings, compared morbidity and mortality rates across time and with other units, and tried to stay healthy themselves. They wrote detailed reports to their superiors and published myriad articles on the influenza of 1918–1919. These studies and reports would provide some of the most extensive documentation on the pandemic, informing civilian and military researchers alike as they struggled for years after the war to understand what had caused the epidemic and its widespread suffering.2,4,5,7
As they conducted their analyses, military medical officers soon understood that the wave of influenza that had run through many U.S. training camps during the spring of 1918 constituted a first wave of the pandemic. Fourteen of the largest training camps had reported influenza outbreaks in March, April, or May, and some of the infected troops carried the virus with them aboard ships to France.12 In the late spring and summer, influenza visited all of the armies of Europe, including the AEF, but because influenza was common in the military, and few patients became critically ill, medical officers were not alarmed. But by the late summer some saw the emergence of a new, lethal influenza.
Captain Alan M. Chesney, medical officer with an AEF hospital at Valdahon, an artillery training camp behind the front lines in France, documented the evolution of a more virulent influenza from his vantage point. A physician who was later dean of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, Chesney noted that three different infantry brigades of 4,000 men occupied the post in succession, “thus every three or four weeks there occurred a marked change in the population of the post.” He theorized that “the history of the epidemic, therefore, resolved itself into distinct periods corresponding to the various brigades which entered the post,” and “the frequent changes in the population of the post, brought about by the short stay of each brigade, exercised considerable influence upon the course of the epidemic of influenza.”
During Chesney's first documented period, the month of June to July 27, the 5th Artillery Brigade had 77 “relatively mild” cases of influenza. During the second phase, July 27 to August 23, 200 men of the 58th Artillery Brigade became ill, about 6.5%. None of them died, but the outbreak was serious enough that the next brigade cleaned out the barracks, even washing the walls, before they moved in. Despite this precaution, during Chesney's third phase, August 23 to November 8, more than one-third of the 6th Artillery Brigade, 1,636 soldiers, contracted influenza and 151 died. Chesney concluded that “…these successive outbreaks tended to be progressively more severe both in character and extent, which would speak for an increasing virulence of the causative agent.”13
Medical officers such as Chesney wanted clean barracks and also worried about crowding. Surgeon General Gorgas had recommended that Army housing provide 60 square feet per man, but did not often prevail. As Gorgas told one training camp commander, “We know perfectly well that we can control pneumonia absolutely if we could avoid crowding the men, but it is not practicable in military life to avoid this crowding.”14 The Medical Department even asserted that “there is to be expected a definite relation between the degree of crowding and the amount of respiratory infection.”2 (p. 111) But if it was difficult to control crowding in the training camps, it was impossible in the battlefields. Evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald has argued that trench warfare and its crowded conditions enabled an especially aggressive and deadly influenza virus to gain footing in humans.15 As soldiers in the trenches became sick, the military evacuated them from the front lines and replaced them with healthy men. This process continuously brought the virus into contact with new hosts—young, healthy soldiers in which it could adapt, reproduce, and become extremely virulent without danger of burning out. From there, according to a Navy report, “It is reasonable to suppose that late in August influenza of severe type was spread from French, Spanish, and Portuguese seaports to the Orient, South Africa, the United States, and South America.”5 (p. 2427) As Chesney and Ewald suggest, the influenza of 1918 was a product of trench warfare, and the influenza that attacked the 6th Artillery at Valdahon would travel the highways of war, circling the globe.

INFLUENZA IN THE CAMPS
Braisted pinpointed the arrival of the epidemic in the United States to Tuesday, August 27, 1918, at Commonwealth Pier in Boston “…when three cases of influenza were committed to the sick list.” The next day produced eight cases, and on August 29, 58 cases were reported, 15 so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea.5 (p. 2427) Within 48 hours, three medical officers who had seen the patients also fell ill.5 (p. 2473–4) Influenza reached civilians in Boston and on September 8, arrived “completely unheralded” at the Army's Camp Devens, outside of the city. Within 10 days, the base hospital and regimental infirmaries were overwhelmed with thousands of sick trainees.16,17
Gorgas sent his best epidemiologists to Camp Devens to investigate. His team included Victor C. Vaughan, dean of the University of Michigan School of Medicine and director of the Surgeon General's Office of Communicable Disease; William Henry Welch, famed pathologist from Johns Hopkins; and Rufus Cole, respiratory diseases expert from the Rockefeller Institute.18 They found the medical situation “grave,” and recommended 16 measures to control the outbreak, the most dramatic being a halt to transfers in or out of Devens until the epidemic passed. Camp Devens physicians performing autopsies described influenza pathology as unique, characterized by “the intense congestion and hemorrhage” of the lungs.19 Cole and Welch observed one such autopsy, and Cole noted that Welch, “turned away from the blue, swollen lungs with wet, foamy, shapeless surfaces [and] became excited and nervous, saying, `This must be some new kind of infection or plague.'” Added Cole, “It was not surprising that the rest of us were disturbed, but it shocked me to find that the situation, momentarily at least, was too much even for Dr. Welch.”20
But as Vaughan and Welch investigated Camp Devens, the virus kept moving. Before any travel ban could be imposed, a contingent of replacement troops departed Devens for Camp Upton, Long Island, the Army's debarkation point for France, and took influenza with them. Medical officers at Upton said it arrived “abruptly” on September 13, 1918, with 38 hospital admissions, followed by 86 the next day, and 193 the next. Hospital admissions peaked on October 4 with 483, and within 40 days, Camp Upton sent 6,131 men to the hospital for influenza. Some developed pneumonia so quickly that physicians diagnosed it simply by observing the patient rather than listening to the lungs. “The patient looked sick and suggested a serious condition,” they wrote, “his face was often cyanotic, sometimes ashy, sometimes just pinched looking. He expressed no pain or suffering. If his mind was clear he expressed a sense of euphoria, or of unnatural realization of his condition, which in particular marked the advanced stages of the disease.”21 Private James Downs entered the hospital on September 23 with a temperature of 104 degrees and died three days later. An Army pathologist clipped a piece of Downs' lungs and sent it to the Army Medical Museum as a specimen of the damage influenza was doing to young soldiers.22 As they walked through Camp Upton's pneumonia wards of 900 patients, medical officers experienced “horror at the frightfulness of the sight of the hopelessly sick and dying and at the magnitude of the catastrophe that had stricken wholesale the young soldiers prepared to face another enemy but helpless before this insidious one.” That sight, they said, “will haunt for life the minds of those who saw it.”21
In efforts to contain the outbreak, Camp Upton's commander John Mallory put its 30,000 inhabitants under quarantine, barring travel in and out except on “the most urgent business.”23 But in wars and epidemics there is much urgent business and people got through. Naomi Barnett of Brockton, Massachusetts, had sped to Upton to care for her fiancée Jacob Julian when she learned he was ill. They planned to be married before he departed for duty in France but the young woman died of pneumonia two days after arriving at the camp. Her beloved died 30 minutes later. “Relatives,” reported the local newspaper, “are planning a double funeral in Brockton.”24 To control influenza and pneumonia, the hospital provided patients with 100 square feet of floor space, separated beds by sheets, and furnished face masks to everyone in the camp. As pneumonia spread, medical officers also sprayed the mouths and throats of 800 healthy men daily with the solution of dichloramine-T as a preventive measure, but when they compared their influenza rates with 800 untreated men, they were disappointed to find that “…over a period of twenty days the incidence in the two groups was the same.”2 (p. 121)
As Upton medical officers climbed the peak of their epidemic, the virus traveled west and south, arriving at Camp Grant, Illinois, on Saturday, September 21, 1918, with 70 hospital admissions. “So sudden and appalling was the visitation that it required the greatest energy and cooperation of every officer, every man, and every nurse to meet the emergency,” wrote one observer.4 (p. 749) Hospital admissions rose to 194, then 370, then 492, to a high of 788 admissions on September 29. Hospital officials summoned all officers on leave, converted barracks to hospital wards, and by “extreme effort” expanded the hospital capacity from “10 occupied beds to a capacity of 4,102 beds in six days.”4 (p.751) Influenza still overwhelmed every department. The hospital laboratory resorted to local civilian facilities to perform specimen tests. Camp ophthalmologists saw patients with conjunctivitis, an influenza complication, and ear, nose, and throat specialists saw those with other dangerous secondary infections. As individuals became seriously ill, camp officials sent out “danger” or “death” telegrams to families and loved ones, but soon they received so many return calls, telegrams, and visitors, they had to set up a separate hospital tent as an information bureau. Medical personnel were not immune. Eleven of the 81 medical officers fell ill, and three civilian and three Army nurses died. The epidemic even caused the Medical Department to drop its prohibition on black nurses so that Camp Grant called African American nurses to care for patients. The women had to wait, however, until separate, segregated accommodations could be constructed.25
Ten days after the epidemic struck, hospital admissions began to fall but pneumonia took hold, and Camp Grant's daily death toll began to climb. It reached double digits on October 1 with 14 deaths, then 30 the next day, 46 the next, and 76 on October 4. The mortuary was designed to handle only four deaths a day. On Friday, October 4, with more than 100 bodies in the mortuary camp, officials negotiated with local undertakers to take the bodies at $50 each, but when someone produced a flatbed truck to remove the dead, the Army quickly provided more dignified closed trucks. The number of dead broke 100 on October 5 and reached a horrifying high of 117 deaths on October 6.4 (p. 750–4) The last day the Camp Grant death toll exceeded 100 was October 9, but the decline was too late for its commander. Col. Charles B. Hagadorn, a West Point graduate and career officer who had served in Russia and the Panama Canal Zone, was acting camp commander when influenza struck. Although Camp Grant's sickness and death rates were no worse than other camps and better than some, fellow officers later told reporters that Hagadorn had been showing the strain of the epidemic.26,27 Troubled as more than 500 soldiers died of pneumonia under his command, on October 7, he committed suicide with a pistol shot to his head. In the end, Camp Grant suffered 10,713 influenza victims, including 1,060 deaths in a population of 40,000.4 (p. 749)
Across the country, medical officers noted the rapidity with which the epidemic hit each camp, in some cases reaching its highest number of cases within 10 days (Figure 2).5 (p. 2429) The steep gradient of the flu attacks can be seen in the headlines of The Camp Dodger, the weekly newspaper of Camp Dodge, Iowa, which strobe the trajectory of the epidemic. The flu struck on September 29, so its first mention is an October 4 headline: “Dodge Battles Spanish ‘Flu’; Impose Quarantine, Cases Number 1500, One Death Reported.” The next week's front page announced, “Flu Epidemic Subsiding; Fewer New Cases; Death Rate Is Low,” and the following week's headline read, “Peak Flu Scourge Has Passed.” Influenza disappeared from the front page of the October 25 edition, and the November 1 front page noted, “Services in Memory of Dodge Dead; Soldiers and Civilians Will Pay Tribute Sunday to Victims of Epidemic.”28–31 And that was it. Although Camp Dodge would have one of the worst records among Army camps with more than 13,700 hospital admissions and 700 deaths, the epidemic had passed and the Armistice dominated the news.4 (p. 2017)

Influenza reached all Army training camps in a month, arriving September 8 at Camp Devens, September 13 at Camp Upton, September 21 at Camp Grant, September 26 at Camp Cody, and then on to the West Coast, arriving October 8 at Camp Fremont, California, and October 9 at Camp Lewis, Washington.2 (p. 138) War Department training reports show that as influenza arrived at each camp, it “interfered with,” “curtailed,” “brought to a standstill,” or even caused the discontinuation of training activities as recruits and instructors fell ill.32 The deadly second wave of the epidemic lasted about four weeks in individual camps and ran its course in the Army in about eight weeks, roughly from September 15 to November 15, 1918. The high-water mark for deaths in the United States came the week of October 4 and in the AEF, the week of October 11.4 (p. 2755) Navy and Army officers observed that the U.S. camps had higher morbidity and mortality rates than shipboard sailors or AEF soldiers and Marines; one report set hospital admissions for influenza at 167 per 1,000 in the AEF compared to 361 per 1,000 in the U.S. camps.4 (p. 1469) Officers believed this was because deployed personnel had been exposed to influenza in an earlier wave and therefore had some immunity to the second deadly wave.5 (p. 2414)
In some camps, African American soldiers had lower morbidity but higher mortality rates than white soldiers, and some medical officers erroneously attributed this to racial weakness and susceptibility. But segregation, ironically, may have shielded some black units from influenza infection, and the higher mortality could have been due to African Americans' often inferior living conditions and medical care in the military. Segregation in the Army was rarely “separate but equal.” One study of the army rations allocated to men at camps Grant, Dodge, and Funston over four months revealed that the 366th Infantry of the Ninety-second Division, one of the black combat divisions, received less protein and fewer calories than the white units, even though they were on the average taller and heavier than their white counterparts.33 Private Robert Stevens of Louisiana, with the 803rd Pioneers, a black unit that fought in the Meuse-Argonne, also remembered that when several hundred men in his regiment were sick with pneumonia, they had only one medical officer.34
In Europe, influenza attacked Allied and German armies alike, filling field hospitals and transport trains with weak, feverish men all along the Western Front. On October 18, the AEF chief surgeon reported that “…influenza and pneumonia continue to prevail in all parts of the A.E.F.”35 Influenza cases outnumbered combat casualties. According to one tally, 227,000 soldiers were hospitalized for battle wounds in 1918, but half again as many AEF soldiers—340,000—were hospitalized for influenza.4 (p. 1429–41) The epidemic struck during the climax of the American military effort, compromising the AEF's performance in its largest campaign of the war, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Influenza clogged transportation lines along the battlefront, choked hospitals, killed thousands of soldiers, and rendered many more non-effective. The flu depleted and demoralized troops, and may have diverted military and political leaders from fighting the war to combating disease. It ultimately killed more American military personnel than did enemy machine guns and artillery (Figure 3).

THE ARMY AND NAVY RESPOND
As he watched the epidemic unfold, Acting Army Surgeon General Charles Richard warned the Medical Corps that “…no disease which the army surgeon is likely to see in this war will tax more severely his judgment and initiative.”36 His office distributed numerous bulletins on influenza and pneumonia to Army personnel and fired off daily memos to Army Chief of Staff Peyton March and others making recommendations on the epidemic.37,18 Concerned about influenza spreading on crowded troopships, Richard advised March against sending troops from infected camps to France until the epidemic was over in their region.18 March approved this recommendation, which at first affected only a few training camps. But as the epidemic widened, Richard called for canceling all draft calls for registrants destined for infected camps and minimizing transfers between camps. “Epidemic influenza has become a very serious menace,” he told March, “and threatens not only to retard the military program, but to exact a heavy toll in human life, before the disease has run its course throughout the country.”18,38 March's office instructed camp commanders to reduce crowding and increase medical personnel, but halted only some of the draft calls, so that in late September new recruits were still entering training camps. Only the Provost Marshall's cancellation of the October draft finally eased pressure on the camps.39
Richard also recommended a one-week quarantine of all troops prior to embarkation and reducing the capacity of troopships by one-half. Desperate to build up the forces in France, March rejected these suggestions in favor of rigorous pre-boarding physical screening to control the epidemic. Richard countered: “It is impossible for medical officers to state with any degree of safety that any particular command is free from infection, or that it may safely embark on troopships for overseas service.” He then recommended “that all troop movements overseas be suspended for the present, except such as are demanded by urgent military necessity.”18 Richard was willing to suspend war mobilization to protect the health of the soldiers. March agreed to a 10% reduction in crowding on troopships, but that was all. The controversy reached the White House when President Wilson asked March why he refused to stop troop transport during the epidemic. March described the Army's screening precautions and invoked the exigencies of a war of attrition, pointing out “…the psychological effect it would have on a weakening enemy to learn that the American divisions and replacements were no longer arriving.”40 Troop shipments should not be halted for any reason, he told Wilson, and the president deferred to his judgment. March and Wilson had no intention of retarding U.S. participation in the war. By mid-October, however, the practice of taking men from camps that had already weathered the epidemic did finally reduce the influenza rates on troopships and in the AEF.
Sickness rates in U.S. camps ultimately ranged from 10% at Camp Lewis, Washington, to 63% at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, averaging between 25% and 40%; death rates ranged from less than 1% at many camps to 3.3% at Camp Sherman, Ohio.2 (p. 138) But the sickness rates probably understated the problem because they captured only those soldiers who reported sick and received medical attention. Army investigators found that some regimental physicians did not send soldiers to hospitals unless they had temperatures higher than 101 degrees.4 (p. 3794) Many stricken soldiers may have just stayed in bed with or without knowledge or permission of their superior officers. Others may have gone home when they got sick, either with leave or AWOL. “One of the boys played wise and got sick while he was home,” Charles Johnston, a soldier at Camp Funston, Kansas, wrote home in early October. “He is down with pneumonia, so will have a prolonged visit while home. Think I will try that when I come home, eh!” Several days later Johnston reported, “There have been hundreds of boys taken A.W.O.L. since [the camp was] quarantined.”41 The situation became so bad that the War Department ordered the investigation of absentees from government service.42
While the implementation of treatment and prevention measures varied from camp to camp, medical officers generally tried “all preventive measures which seemed logical,” according to Braisted. Quarantines were almost impossible to maintain and had little effect. The Navy, rushing to transport troops across the Atlantic, imposed modified quarantines at many stations but “…invariably this measure failed to prevent the introduction of influenza.”5 (p. 2486) As the Army Medical Department explained, “…to be of avail in excluding influenza, quarantine must more nearly approach perfection than proved practicable in the large camps of the war.”2 (p. 116) Other prevention measures included daily inspections and temperature-taking, patient isolation, face masks and gowns for attendants, good ventilation, screening between beds, prohibition of indoor gatherings, nose and throat sprays for the healthy, and experimental vaccines. In assessing these measures, however, Braisted concluded that “each particular preventive measure failed in some instances to accomplish recognizable results.”5 (p. 2483) The Army Medical Department similarly admitted that “the best result to be expected from any or all of these measures is a slowing of the progress of an epidemic rather than any considerable diminution in the number of cases.”2 (p. 123-4)
The Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Rockford, Illinois, provided an example of a failed measure. When it offered masks to personnel, only 96 out of 674 hospital corpsmen wore them and they experienced a higher influenza rate than those who did not wear masks—8.3% compared with 7.9%.5 (p. 2490) Great Lakes was by far the largest Navy camp, with a population of 44,000, and influenza arrived with “explosive violence” on September 16 and within 30 days generated 9,623 cases.5,11 (p. 2430) Harney Stover, a sailor from Indiana training at Great Lakes, explained to his mother that influenza “affects most men pretty hard for the first few hours. They turned ashen gray and usually faint.” He commented that “at the rate it is spreading, everyone will have had it and be well in a week,” but he was overly optimistic.43 Within weeks hundreds of his fellow trainees would die, as would many of those who were caring for them.5 (p. 2452) Although only one Navy nurse had died during the war to date, 25 succumbed to the pandemic, seven of them at Great Lakes camp: Theresa Burmeister, Myrtle Grant, Edith Hokanson, Emma Kotte, Alice Lea, Garnet Olive Peck, and Amber Story.5 (p. 2071)
Stover escaped the flu but chafed at the quarantine. He was furious when a local mayor objected to lifting it. “When we get liberty once more the mayor of Waukegan is going to have his darn little town run off the map and get tar and fethered [sic] himself.” But if it was difficult to contain the influenza virus, it was harder to contain sailors and soldiers. When false rumors of an armistice hit the camp, “the whole station went wild,” wrote Stover. “In the next Regiment, they tore the doors off 2 barracks trying to get out…It was almost an hour before the Provost Guards could make everybody get back in their barracks.”43
When the Armistice finally came on November 11, it was impossible to maintain quarantines, but by then influenza had passed through most camps, leaving much to celebrate and to mourn. Influenza would again sweep American military camps in the United States and Europe in early 1919, but would be less virulent than the previous wave and find less fuel, as demobilization rapidly depopulated the camps. While the U.S. military had helped to subdue the Germans, the medical profession had failed to conquer an even more deadly, unseen enemy. Now in peacetime, thousands of physicians left military service to return to civilian life, taking with them their searing experiences of war and disease, victory and defeat.

SYNOPSIS
The American military experience in World War I and the influenza pandemic were closely intertwined. The war fostered influenza in the crowded conditions of military camps in the United States and in the trenches of the Western Front in Europe. The virus traveled with military personnel from camp to camp and across the Atlantic, and at the height of the American military involvement in the war, September through November 1918, influenza and pneumonia sickened 20% to 40% of U.S. Army and Navy personnel. These high morbidity rates interfered with induction and training schedules in the United States and rendered hundreds of thousands of military personnel non-effective. During the American Expeditionary Forces' campaign at Meuse-Argonne, the epidemic diverted urgently needed resources from combat support to transporting and caring for the sick and the dead. Influenza and pneumonia killed more American soldiers and sailors during the war than did enemy weapons.
In the fall of 1918, U.S. Army and Navy medical officers in camps across the country presided over the worst epidemic in American history, but the story was not new. War and disease have been linked throughout history as armies, weapons, and human pathogens have met on the battlefield. The conquistadores brought with them diseases that devastated the New World; typhus plagued Napoleon's armies; and typhoid fever humiliated the American Army during the Spanish-American War. But now U.S. Army and Navy personnel knew how to test and sanitize water supplies, vaccinate troops against typhoid and smallpox, and treat or prevent other infections. Modern bacteriology, it seemed, had tamed many diseases. Navy Surgeon General William C. Braisted proudly stated that “infectious diseases that formerly carried off their thousands, such as yellow fever, typhus, cholera, and typhoid, have all yielded to our modern knowledge of their causes and our consequent logical measures taken for their prevention.”1
Twentieth-century warfare, however, had evolved to an even more deadly scale as industrialized armies of millions battled on the plains of Eastern Europe, the cliffs of Gallipoli, and in the deadly trenches of the 550-mile-long Western Front. When the European arms race exploded into war in 1914, the empires shocked themselves and the world with the killing power of their artillery and machine guns, their U-boats and mines, and their poison gas. These new weapons generated new, horrible injuries that took life and limb in a flash or festered into gangrenous wounds that could further maim and kill. The carnage traumatized some men into shellshock, and poison gases burned and suffocated others so horribly that nurses dreaded caring for them because they could provide little comfort. War diseases—notably the soldiers' nemeses diarrhea, dysentery, and typhus—flourished, and the trenches offered new maladies such as “trench foot,” an infection caused by wearing sodden boots and standing in water and mud for days on end, and “trench fever,” a debilitating fever transmitted by body lice.
Then, in the fourth dreadful year of the war, as the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) assumed fighting strength and prepared their first great offensive against the Germans, the flu struck. By the War Department's most conservative count, influenza sickened 26% of the Army—more than one million men—and killed almost 30,000 before they even got to France.2,3 On both sides of the Atlantic, the Army lost a staggering 8,743,102 days to influenza among enlisted men in 1918.4 (p. 1448) The Navy recorded 5,027 deaths and more than 106,000 hospital admissions for influenza and pneumonia out of 600,000 men, but given the large number of mild cases that were never recorded, Braisted put the sickness rate closer to 40%.5,6 (p. 2458)
The Army and Navy medical services may have tamed typhoid and typhus, but more American soldiers, sailors, and Marines would succumb to influenza and pneumonia than would die on the industrialized battlefields of the Great War. The story of the influenza epidemic in the military is often lost in the historical narrative of the Great War, included merely as a coda to that four-year horror, coinciding with the final battles and the Armistice. But an examination of medical reports and War Department and Department of the Navy documents from the war reveals that the war and the epidemic were intertwined.7 World War I and influenza collaborated: the war fostered disease by creating conditions in the trenches of France that some epidemiologists believe enabled the influenza virus to evolve into a killer of global proportions. In turn, disease shaped the war effort by rendering much of the Army and Navy non-effective and diverting resources, personnel, and scarce human attention and energy from the military campaign. The exigencies of war also thwarted many of the efforts such as crowd mitigation and quarantines to control the epidemic. The influenza epidemic in the U.S. military therefore provides a cautionary tale about the power of war to change the health environment and the power of disease to influence the conduct of war.

GOING TO WAR
The United States at first hung back from the killing in Europe, as many Americans believed it was not their fight. But under increasing pressure from Britain and France, and angered by German U-boat attacks that threatened American commerce and security, and the revelations in the Zimmermann Telegram that Germany was urging Mexico to attack the United States, President Wilson abandoned neutrality and in April 1917 asked Congress for a declaration of war.
The U.S. economy was already booming as farmers and manufacturers shipped foodstuffs and military supplies to the belligerent nations. Now the United States would also generate its own military force that would help overwhelm the enemy and bring about the armistice of November 11, 1918. Congress quickly established a draft, and more than 4,600 Selective Service draft boards screened 10 million men to find the strongest and most fit soldiers and sailors. The military grew from just 378,000 strong in April 1917 to more than 4.7 million by war's end, with an Army of 4.1 million and a Navy of 600,000. Seventy-two percent of enlisted forces were inducted, and the military population reflected the country's ethnically diverse and racially segregated society. An estimated 20% of Army draftees were foreign-born and the troops spoke at least 46 languages, some 5,700 were Mexican aliens, and 12,500 were American Indians.8 (p. 367-409) More than 400,000 African Americans served in the Army, some in two black combat divisions but most in labor battalions. The Navy employed only 5,300 black sailors, confining them to positions as cooks and stewards.9
War mobilization drew millions of civilians into military institutions and extended the military into all corners of the country. To train and supply these men, the Army and Navy expanded existing facilities and directed training activities at various civilian organizations. Military camps, arsenals, air fields, and supply depots sprouted up in every state. The Army began training recruits in the fall of 1917 at 32 large camps, each home to 25,000 to 55,000 troops. Soldiers also went to specialized camps for training in specific fields such as artillery training at Camp Knox, Kentucky, railway operations at Camp Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis, military engineering at Camp Forrest, Georgia, and medical unit training at Camp Crane, Pennsylvania. The War Department also operated some 40 air fields for aviator training and 10 embarkation and debarkation camps.8 (p. 677-–78) The Navy expanded its training capacity from 6,000 recruits to more than 100,000 at stations on both coasts, the Gulf of Mexico, and Lake Michigan, and also had specialized training centers such as the Navy gas engine school and the aviation ignition school at Columbia University in New York. In addition to the training camps, in the summer of 1918 the War Department established the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), intended to augment the work of the Reserve Officers Training Corp (ROTC) and prevent war mobilization from emptying institutions of higher education. Under the program, more than 500 colleges and universities trained officer candidates and provided technical instruction in fields such as auto mechanics and radio operation. By the Armistice, about 158,000 young men had enrolled in SATC programs.8 (p. 556) This expansion of military institutions created a virtual network of young adults across which influenza could and would travel (Figure 1).

As the Army grew, the Army Medical Department raced to meet its needs. Military medicine was more like public health medicine (which managed large populations) than private medicine (which focused on care for individuals). By necessity, line officers cared less about who was sick or on leave than who they could send into battle. This was called the “effective” rate—how many men were available in a given unit to work and fight. Medical officers therefore tried to keep non-effective rates as low as possible, and measured their success statistically more than by individual patient care. The Army Medical Department tracked sickness in camps, combat units, labor battalions, ports, and ships by the day, week, month, and year, and compared its record with civilians, earlier wars, and other armies. Army Medicine also combined the old sanitation model of clean water and fresh air with the new public health approaches of educating soldiers on how to stay healthy and prevent disease. Army Surgeon General William C. Gorgas came out of the sanitary tradition and stressed good food, clean water, fresh air, and no crowding, but like other Progressives, also saw the Army as an opportunity to instill young men with middle-class values such as good personal hygiene.10
To care for the growing Army, the Medical Department increased its hospital capacity from 9,500 beds to 120,000 in the United States alone. The Red Cross assisted by recruiting trained nurses for the Army Nurse Corps and organizing ambulance companies and 50 hospitals of 1,000 beds each out of American universities and medical institutions. The Army Medical Department ultimately numbered 30,500 medical officers, 21,500 nurses—including 350 African American physicians but no black nurses until December 1918—and 264,000 enlisted men.8 (p. 257) The Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery had some 3,000 medical officers, 1,700 nurses, and 11,000 enlisted men.5 (p. 2066, 2073) As one civilian public health official pointed out, with almost 30% of American physicians in military service, “…there were sections of the country that were absolutely stripped of physicians.” During the pandemic in civil society, therefore, “…the great majority of available, medical and nursing personnel, were already in the Army or Navy, so that the available personnel from which to draw was limited.”11
World War I was largely a ground war, so the Army bore the brunt of the fighting. While some 55,000 Marines served with the AEF, most of the Navy's responsibilities involved patrolling for U-boats, sweeping for enemy mines, escorting troop and cargo ships across the Atlantic, and mining the North Sea against the German Navy. Mobilization got off to a slow start in the United States, and a year after the declaration of war, the AEF in Europe numbered fewer than 400,000. By May 1918, however, hundreds of thousands of soldiers were crossing the Atlantic each month to build a combat force of two million by November. This transport of an army to another continent and back was one of the great achievements of World War I and demonstrated the power of the American government and economy. But such triumph also carried danger because as the doughboys traveled “Over There,” they did not travel alone.

A LETHAL VIRUS
Influenza sailed with American troops across the Atlantic and when it exploded in late August and September in Europe and the United States, medical officers found themselves on the front lines of an epidemic worse than any of them had ever seen or imagined. Many were among the most knowledgeable and skilled physicians in the country and had just recently entered military service. They did their best to save those stricken by influenza, but could do little more than provide palliative care of warmth, rest, and a gentle diet, and hope that their patients did not develop pneumonia.
One of the tragedies of the influenza epidemic is that by the 1910s, the medical profession held many of the scientific and epidemiological tools to understand the nature and extent of the damage influenza and pneumonia were wreaking on their patients, but lacked the tools to effectively fight them. While virology would not emerge until the 1930s, physicians could identify many of the bacteria causing the deadly pneumonias that were killing their patients, but without antibiotics they could do little to fight the infections. Thus, as the epidemic struck their camps, hospitals, ships, ports, or divisions, many medical officers documented what they saw, as if trying to define that which they could not control. They ran tests and did autopsies, recorded their laboratory and clinical findings, compared morbidity and mortality rates across time and with other units, and tried to stay healthy themselves. They wrote detailed reports to their superiors and published myriad articles on the influenza of 1918–1919. These studies and reports would provide some of the most extensive documentation on the pandemic, informing civilian and military researchers alike as they struggled for years after the war to understand what had caused the epidemic and its widespread suffering.2,4,5,7
As they conducted their analyses, military medical officers soon understood that the wave of influenza that had run through many U.S. training camps during the spring of 1918 constituted a first wave of the pandemic. Fourteen of the largest training camps had reported influenza outbreaks in March, April, or May, and some of the infected troops carried the virus with them aboard ships to France.12 In the late spring and summer, influenza visited all of the armies of Europe, including the AEF, but because influenza was common in the military, and few patients became critically ill, medical officers were not alarmed. But by the late summer some saw the emergence of a new, lethal influenza.
Captain Alan M. Chesney, medical officer with an AEF hospital at Valdahon, an artillery training camp behind the front lines in France, documented the evolution of a more virulent influenza from his vantage point. A physician who was later dean of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, Chesney noted that three different infantry brigades of 4,000 men occupied the post in succession, “thus every three or four weeks there occurred a marked change in the population of the post.” He theorized that “the history of the epidemic, therefore, resolved itself into distinct periods corresponding to the various brigades which entered the post,” and “the frequent changes in the population of the post, brought about by the short stay of each brigade, exercised considerable influence upon the course of the epidemic of influenza.”
During Chesney's first documented period, the month of June to July 27, the 5th Artillery Brigade had 77 “relatively mild” cases of influenza. During the second phase, July 27 to August 23, 200 men of the 58th Artillery Brigade became ill, about 6.5%. None of them died, but the outbreak was serious enough that the next brigade cleaned out the barracks, even washing the walls, before they moved in. Despite this precaution, during Chesney's third phase, August 23 to November 8, more than one-third of the 6th Artillery Brigade, 1,636 soldiers, contracted influenza and 151 died. Chesney concluded that “…these successive outbreaks tended to be progressively more severe both in character and extent, which would speak for an increasing virulence of the causative agent.”13
Medical officers such as Chesney wanted clean barracks and also worried about crowding. Surgeon General Gorgas had recommended that Army housing provide 60 square feet per man, but did not often prevail. As Gorgas told one training camp commander, “We know perfectly well that we can control pneumonia absolutely if we could avoid crowding the men, but it is not practicable in military life to avoid this crowding.”14 The Medical Department even asserted that “there is to be expected a definite relation between the degree of crowding and the amount of respiratory infection.”2 (p. 111) But if it was difficult to control crowding in the training camps, it was impossible in the battlefields. Evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald has argued that trench warfare and its crowded conditions enabled an especially aggressive and deadly influenza virus to gain footing in humans.15 As soldiers in the trenches became sick, the military evacuated them from the front lines and replaced them with healthy men. This process continuously brought the virus into contact with new hosts—young, healthy soldiers in which it could adapt, reproduce, and become extremely virulent without danger of burning out. From there, according to a Navy report, “It is reasonable to suppose that late in August influenza of severe type was spread from French, Spanish, and Portuguese seaports to the Orient, South Africa, the United States, and South America.”5 (p. 2427) As Chesney and Ewald suggest, the influenza of 1918 was a product of trench warfare, and the influenza that attacked the 6th Artillery at Valdahon would travel the highways of war, circling the globe.

INFLUENZA IN THE CAMPS
Braisted pinpointed the arrival of the epidemic in the United States to Tuesday, August 27, 1918, at Commonwealth Pier in Boston “…when three cases of influenza were committed to the sick list.” The next day produced eight cases, and on August 29, 58 cases were reported, 15 so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea.5 (p. 2427) Within 48 hours, three medical officers who had seen the patients also fell ill.5 (p. 2473–4) Influenza reached civilians in Boston and on September 8, arrived “completely unheralded” at the Army's Camp Devens, outside of the city. Within 10 days, the base hospital and regimental infirmaries were overwhelmed with thousands of sick trainees.16,17
Gorgas sent his best epidemiologists to Camp Devens to investigate. His team included Victor C. Vaughan, dean of the University of Michigan School of Medicine and director of the Surgeon General's Office of Communicable Disease; William Henry Welch, famed pathologist from Johns Hopkins; and Rufus Cole, respiratory diseases expert from the Rockefeller Institute.18 They found the medical situation “grave,” and recommended 16 measures to control the outbreak, the most dramatic being a halt to transfers in or out of Devens until the epidemic passed. Camp Devens physicians performing autopsies described influenza pathology as unique, characterized by “the intense congestion and hemorrhage” of the lungs.19 Cole and Welch observed one such autopsy, and Cole noted that Welch, “turned away from the blue, swollen lungs with wet, foamy, shapeless surfaces [and] became excited and nervous, saying, `This must be some new kind of infection or plague.'” Added Cole, “It was not surprising that the rest of us were disturbed, but it shocked me to find that the situation, momentarily at least, was too much even for Dr. Welch.”20
But as Vaughan and Welch investigated Camp Devens, the virus kept moving. Before any travel ban could be imposed, a contingent of replacement troops departed Devens for Camp Upton, Long Island, the Army's debarkation point for France, and took influenza with them. Medical officers at Upton said it arrived “abruptly” on September 13, 1918, with 38 hospital admissions, followed by 86 the next day, and 193 the next. Hospital admissions peaked on October 4 with 483, and within 40 days, Camp Upton sent 6,131 men to the hospital for influenza. Some developed pneumonia so quickly that physicians diagnosed it simply by observing the patient rather than listening to the lungs. “The patient looked sick and suggested a serious condition,” they wrote, “his face was often cyanotic, sometimes ashy, sometimes just pinched looking. He expressed no pain or suffering. If his mind was clear he expressed a sense of euphoria, or of unnatural realization of his condition, which in particular marked the advanced stages of the disease.”21 Private James Downs entered the hospital on September 23 with a temperature of 104 degrees and died three days later. An Army pathologist clipped a piece of Downs' lungs and sent it to the Army Medical Museum as a specimen of the damage influenza was doing to young soldiers.22 As they walked through Camp Upton's pneumonia wards of 900 patients, medical officers experienced “horror at the frightfulness of the sight of the hopelessly sick and dying and at the magnitude of the catastrophe that had stricken wholesale the young soldiers prepared to face another enemy but helpless before this insidious one.” That sight, they said, “will haunt for life the minds of those who saw it.”21
In efforts to contain the outbreak, Camp Upton's commander John Mallory put its 30,000 inhabitants under quarantine, barring travel in and out except on “the most urgent business.”23 But in wars and epidemics there is much urgent business and people got through. Naomi Barnett of Brockton, Massachusetts, had sped to Upton to care for her fiancée Jacob Julian when she learned he was ill. They planned to be married before he departed for duty in France but the young woman died of pneumonia two days after arriving at the camp. Her beloved died 30 minutes later. “Relatives,” reported the local newspaper, “are planning a double funeral in Brockton.”24 To control influenza and pneumonia, the hospital provided patients with 100 square feet of floor space, separated beds by sheets, and furnished face masks to everyone in the camp. As pneumonia spread, medical officers also sprayed the mouths and throats of 800 healthy men daily with the solution of dichloramine-T as a preventive measure, but when they compared their influenza rates with 800 untreated men, they were disappointed to find that “…over a period of twenty days the incidence in the two groups was the same.”2 (p. 121)
As Upton medical officers climbed the peak of their epidemic, the virus traveled west and south, arriving at Camp Grant, Illinois, on Saturday, September 21, 1918, with 70 hospital admissions. “So sudden and appalling was the visitation that it required the greatest energy and cooperation of every officer, every man, and every nurse to meet the emergency,” wrote one observer.4 (p. 749) Hospital admissions rose to 194, then 370, then 492, to a high of 788 admissions on September 29. Hospital officials summoned all officers on leave, converted barracks to hospital wards, and by “extreme effort” expanded the hospital capacity from “10 occupied beds to a capacity of 4,102 beds in six days.”4 (p.751) Influenza still overwhelmed every department. The hospital laboratory resorted to local civilian facilities to perform specimen tests. Camp ophthalmologists saw patients with conjunctivitis, an influenza complication, and ear, nose, and throat specialists saw those with other dangerous secondary infections. As individuals became seriously ill, camp officials sent out “danger” or “death” telegrams to families and loved ones, but soon they received so many return calls, telegrams, and visitors, they had to set up a separate hospital tent as an information bureau. Medical personnel were not immune. Eleven of the 81 medical officers fell ill, and three civilian and three Army nurses died. The epidemic even caused the Medical Department to drop its prohibition on black nurses so that Camp Grant called African American nurses to care for patients. The women had to wait, however, until separate, segregated accommodations could be constructed.25
Ten days after the epidemic struck, hospital admissions began to fall but pneumonia took hold, and Camp Grant's daily death toll began to climb. It reached double digits on October 1 with 14 deaths, then 30 the next day, 46 the next, and 76 on October 4. The mortuary was designed to handle only four deaths a day. On Friday, October 4, with more than 100 bodies in the mortuary camp, officials negotiated with local undertakers to take the bodies at $50 each, but when someone produced a flatbed truck to remove the dead, the Army quickly provided more dignified closed trucks. The number of dead broke 100 on October 5 and reached a horrifying high of 117 deaths on October 6.4 (p. 750–4) The last day the Camp Grant death toll exceeded 100 was October 9, but the decline was too late for its commander. Col. Charles B. Hagadorn, a West Point graduate and career officer who had served in Russia and the Panama Canal Zone, was acting camp commander when influenza struck. Although Camp Grant's sickness and death rates were no worse than other camps and better than some, fellow officers later told reporters that Hagadorn had been showing the strain of the epidemic.26,27 Troubled as more than 500 soldiers died of pneumonia under his command, on October 7, he committed suicide with a pistol shot to his head. In the end, Camp Grant suffered 10,713 influenza victims, including 1,060 deaths in a population of 40,000.4 (p. 749)
Across the country, medical officers noted the rapidity with which the epidemic hit each camp, in some cases reaching its highest number of cases within 10 days (Figure 2).5 (p. 2429) The steep gradient of the flu attacks can be seen in the headlines of The Camp Dodger, the weekly newspaper of Camp Dodge, Iowa, which strobe the trajectory of the epidemic. The flu struck on September 29, so its first mention is an October 4 headline: “Dodge Battles Spanish ‘Flu’; Impose Quarantine, Cases Number 1500, One Death Reported.” The next week's front page announced, “Flu Epidemic Subsiding; Fewer New Cases; Death Rate Is Low,” and the following week's headline read, “Peak Flu Scourge Has Passed.” Influenza disappeared from the front page of the October 25 edition, and the November 1 front page noted, “Services in Memory of Dodge Dead; Soldiers and Civilians Will Pay Tribute Sunday to Victims of Epidemic.”28–31 And that was it. Although Camp Dodge would have one of the worst records among Army camps with more than 13,700 hospital admissions and 700 deaths, the epidemic had passed and the Armistice dominated the news.4 (p. 2017)

Influenza reached all Army training camps in a month, arriving September 8 at Camp Devens, September 13 at Camp Upton, September 21 at Camp Grant, September 26 at Camp Cody, and then on to the West Coast, arriving October 8 at Camp Fremont, California, and October 9 at Camp Lewis, Washington.2 (p. 138) War Department training reports show that as influenza arrived at each camp, it “interfered with,” “curtailed,” “brought to a standstill,” or even caused the discontinuation of training activities as recruits and instructors fell ill.32 The deadly second wave of the epidemic lasted about four weeks in individual camps and ran its course in the Army in about eight weeks, roughly from September 15 to November 15, 1918. The high-water mark for deaths in the United States came the week of October 4 and in the AEF, the week of October 11.4 (p. 2755) Navy and Army officers observed that the U.S. camps had higher morbidity and mortality rates than shipboard sailors or AEF soldiers and Marines; one report set hospital admissions for influenza at 167 per 1,000 in the AEF compared to 361 per 1,000 in the U.S. camps.4 (p. 1469) Officers believed this was because deployed personnel had been exposed to influenza in an earlier wave and therefore had some immunity to the second deadly wave.5 (p. 2414)
In some camps, African American soldiers had lower morbidity but higher mortality rates than white soldiers, and some medical officers erroneously attributed this to racial weakness and susceptibility. But segregation, ironically, may have shielded some black units from influenza infection, and the higher mortality could have been due to African Americans' often inferior living conditions and medical care in the military. Segregation in the Army was rarely “separate but equal.” One study of the army rations allocated to men at camps Grant, Dodge, and Funston over four months revealed that the 366th Infantry of the Ninety-second Division, one of the black combat divisions, received less protein and fewer calories than the white units, even though they were on the average taller and heavier than their white counterparts.33 Private Robert Stevens of Louisiana, with the 803rd Pioneers, a black unit that fought in the Meuse-Argonne, also remembered that when several hundred men in his regiment were sick with pneumonia, they had only one medical officer.34
In Europe, influenza attacked Allied and German armies alike, filling field hospitals and transport trains with weak, feverish men all along the Western Front. On October 18, the AEF chief surgeon reported that “…influenza and pneumonia continue to prevail in all parts of the A.E.F.”35 Influenza cases outnumbered combat casualties. According to one tally, 227,000 soldiers were hospitalized for battle wounds in 1918, but half again as many AEF soldiers—340,000—were hospitalized for influenza.4 (p. 1429–41) The epidemic struck during the climax of the American military effort, compromising the AEF's performance in its largest campaign of the war, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Influenza clogged transportation lines along the battlefront, choked hospitals, killed thousands of soldiers, and rendered many more non-effective. The flu depleted and demoralized troops, and may have diverted military and political leaders from fighting the war to combating disease. It ultimately killed more American military personnel than did enemy machine guns and artillery (Figure 3).

THE ARMY AND NAVY RESPOND
As he watched the epidemic unfold, Acting Army Surgeon General Charles Richard warned the Medical Corps that “…no disease which the army surgeon is likely to see in this war will tax more severely his judgment and initiative.”36 His office distributed numerous bulletins on influenza and pneumonia to Army personnel and fired off daily memos to Army Chief of Staff Peyton March and others making recommendations on the epidemic.37,18 Concerned about influenza spreading on crowded troopships, Richard advised March against sending troops from infected camps to France until the epidemic was over in their region.18 March approved this recommendation, which at first affected only a few training camps. But as the epidemic widened, Richard called for canceling all draft calls for registrants destined for infected camps and minimizing transfers between camps. “Epidemic influenza has become a very serious menace,” he told March, “and threatens not only to retard the military program, but to exact a heavy toll in human life, before the disease has run its course throughout the country.”18,38 March's office instructed camp commanders to reduce crowding and increase medical personnel, but halted only some of the draft calls, so that in late September new recruits were still entering training camps. Only the Provost Marshall's cancellation of the October draft finally eased pressure on the camps.39
Richard also recommended a one-week quarantine of all troops prior to embarkation and reducing the capacity of troopships by one-half. Desperate to build up the forces in France, March rejected these suggestions in favor of rigorous pre-boarding physical screening to control the epidemic. Richard countered: “It is impossible for medical officers to state with any degree of safety that any particular command is free from infection, or that it may safely embark on troopships for overseas service.” He then recommended “that all troop movements overseas be suspended for the present, except such as are demanded by urgent military necessity.”18 Richard was willing to suspend war mobilization to protect the health of the soldiers. March agreed to a 10% reduction in crowding on troopships, but that was all. The controversy reached the White House when President Wilson asked March why he refused to stop troop transport during the epidemic. March described the Army's screening precautions and invoked the exigencies of a war of attrition, pointing out “…the psychological effect it would have on a weakening enemy to learn that the American divisions and replacements were no longer arriving.”40 Troop shipments should not be halted for any reason, he told Wilson, and the president deferred to his judgment. March and Wilson had no intention of retarding U.S. participation in the war. By mid-October, however, the practice of taking men from camps that had already weathered the epidemic did finally reduce the influenza rates on troopships and in the AEF.
Sickness rates in U.S. camps ultimately ranged from 10% at Camp Lewis, Washington, to 63% at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, averaging between 25% and 40%; death rates ranged from less than 1% at many camps to 3.3% at Camp Sherman, Ohio.2 (p. 138) But the sickness rates probably understated the problem because they captured only those soldiers who reported sick and received medical attention. Army investigators found that some regimental physicians did not send soldiers to hospitals unless they had temperatures higher than 101 degrees.4 (p. 3794) Many stricken soldiers may have just stayed in bed with or without knowledge or permission of their superior officers. Others may have gone home when they got sick, either with leave or AWOL. “One of the boys played wise and got sick while he was home,” Charles Johnston, a soldier at Camp Funston, Kansas, wrote home in early October. “He is down with pneumonia, so will have a prolonged visit while home. Think I will try that when I come home, eh!” Several days later Johnston reported, “There have been hundreds of boys taken A.W.O.L. since [the camp was] quarantined.”41 The situation became so bad that the War Department ordered the investigation of absentees from government service.42
While the implementation of treatment and prevention measures varied from camp to camp, medical officers generally tried “all preventive measures which seemed logical,” according to Braisted. Quarantines were almost impossible to maintain and had little effect. The Navy, rushing to transport troops across the Atlantic, imposed modified quarantines at many stations but “…invariably this measure failed to prevent the introduction of influenza.”5 (p. 2486) As the Army Medical Department explained, “…to be of avail in excluding influenza, quarantine must more nearly approach perfection than proved practicable in the large camps of the war.”2 (p. 116) Other prevention measures included daily inspections and temperature-taking, patient isolation, face masks and gowns for attendants, good ventilation, screening between beds, prohibition of indoor gatherings, nose and throat sprays for the healthy, and experimental vaccines. In assessing these measures, however, Braisted concluded that “each particular preventive measure failed in some instances to accomplish recognizable results.”5 (p. 2483) The Army Medical Department similarly admitted that “the best result to be expected from any or all of these measures is a slowing of the progress of an epidemic rather than any considerable diminution in the number of cases.”2 (p. 123-4)
The Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Rockford, Illinois, provided an example of a failed measure. When it offered masks to personnel, only 96 out of 674 hospital corpsmen wore them and they experienced a higher influenza rate than those who did not wear masks—8.3% compared with 7.9%.5 (p. 2490) Great Lakes was by far the largest Navy camp, with a population of 44,000, and influenza arrived with “explosive violence” on September 16 and within 30 days generated 9,623 cases.5,11 (p. 2430) Harney Stover, a sailor from Indiana training at Great Lakes, explained to his mother that influenza “affects most men pretty hard for the first few hours. They turned ashen gray and usually faint.” He commented that “at the rate it is spreading, everyone will have had it and be well in a week,” but he was overly optimistic.43 Within weeks hundreds of his fellow trainees would die, as would many of those who were caring for them.5 (p. 2452) Although only one Navy nurse had died during the war to date, 25 succumbed to the pandemic, seven of them at Great Lakes camp: Theresa Burmeister, Myrtle Grant, Edith Hokanson, Emma Kotte, Alice Lea, Garnet Olive Peck, and Amber Story.5 (p. 2071)
Stover escaped the flu but chafed at the quarantine. He was furious when a local mayor objected to lifting it. “When we get liberty once more the mayor of Waukegan is going to have his darn little town run off the map and get tar and fethered [sic] himself.” But if it was difficult to contain the influenza virus, it was harder to contain sailors and soldiers. When false rumors of an armistice hit the camp, “the whole station went wild,” wrote Stover. “In the next Regiment, they tore the doors off 2 barracks trying to get out…It was almost an hour before the Provost Guards could make everybody get back in their barracks.”43
When the Armistice finally came on November 11, it was impossible to maintain quarantines, but by then influenza had passed through most camps, leaving much to celebrate and to mourn. Influenza would again sweep American military camps in the United States and Europe in early 1919, but would be less virulent than the previous wave and find less fuel, as demobilization rapidly depopulated the camps. While the U.S. military had helped to subdue the Germans, the medical profession had failed to conquer an even more deadly, unseen enemy. Now in peacetime, thousands of physicians left military service to return to civilian life, taking with them their searing experiences of war and disease, victory and defeat.

Joseph Stalin was the dictator of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from 1929 to 1953. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union was transformed from a peasant society into an industrial and military superpower. However, he ruled by terror, and millions of his own citizens died during his brutal reign. Stalin became involved in revolutionary politics, as well as criminal activities, as a young man. After Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin died, Stalin outmaneuvered his rivals for control of the party. Stalin aligned with the United States and Britain in World War II but afterward engaged in an increasingly tense relationship with the West known as the Cold War. After his death, the Soviets initiated a de-Stalinization process.
Young Joseph Stalin
Joseph Stalin was born Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili on December 18, 1878, or December 6, 1878, according to the Old Style Julian calendar (although he later invented a new birth date for himself: December 21, 1879). He grew up in the small town of Gori, Georgia, then part of the Russian empire. When he was in his 30s, he took the name Stalin, from the Russian for “man of steel.”
Did you know? In 1925, the Russian city of Tsaritsyn was renamed Stalingrad. In 1961, as part of the de-Stalinization process, the city, located along Europe's longest river, the Volga, became known as Volgograd. Today, it is one of Russia's largest cities and a key industrial center.
Stalin grew up poor and an only child. His father was a shoemaker and an alcoholic who beat his son, and his mother was a laundress. As a boy, Stalin contracted smallpox, which left him with lifelong facial scars. As a teen, he earned a scholarship to attend a seminary in the nearby city of Tblisi and study for the priesthood in the Georgian Orthodox Church.

WATCH NOW
While there he began secretly reading the work of German social philosopher and Communist Manifesto author Karl Marx, becoming interested in the revolutionary movement against the Russian monarchy. In 1899, Stalin was expelled from the seminary for missing exams, although he claimed it was for Marxist propaganda.
After leaving school, Stalin became an underground political agitator, taking part in labor demonstrations and strikes. He adopted the name Koba, after a fictional Georgian outlaw-hero, and joined the more militant wing of the Marxist Social Democratic movement, the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin.
Stalin also became involved in various criminal activities, including bank heists, the proceeds from which were used to help fund the Bolshevik Party. He was arrested multiple times between 1902 and 1913, and subjected to imprisonment and exile in Siberia.
Children
In 1906, Stalin married Ekaterina “Kato” Svanidze, a seamstress. The couple had one son, Yakov, who died as a prisoner in Germany during World War II. Ekaterina perished from typhus when her son was an infant.
In 1918 (some sources cite 1919), Stalin married his second wife, Nadezhda “Nadya” Alliluyeva, the daughter of a Russian revolutionary. They had two children, a boy and a girl (Stalin’s only daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, caused an international scandal when she defected to the United States in 1967). Nadezhda committed suicide in her early 30s. Stalin also fathered several children out of wedlock.
Rise to Power
In 1912, Lenin, who was then in exile in Switzerland, appointed Stalin to serve on the first Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party. Three years later, in November 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power during the Russian Revolution. The Soviet Union was founded in 1922, with Lenin as its first leader.

During these years, Stalin had continued to move up the party ladder, and in 1922 he became secretary general of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, a role that enabled him to appoint his allies to government jobs and grow a base of political support.
After Lenin died in 1924, Stalin eventually outmaneuvered his rivals and won the power struggle for control of the Communist Party. By the late 1920s, he had become dictator of the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union Under Stalin
Starting in the late 1920s, Joseph Stalin launched a series of five-year plans intended to transform the Soviet Union from a peasant society into an industrial superpower. His development plan was centered on government control of the economy and included the forced collectivization of Soviet agriculture, in which the government took control of farms.
Millions of farmers refused to cooperate with Stalin’s orders and were shot or exiled as punishment, particularly the kulaks, the more-prosperous farmers who owned land and hired paid workers. The forced collectivization soon led to widespread famine across the Soviet Union that killed millions.
Stalin ruled by terror, with a totalitarian grip in order to eliminate anyone who might oppose him. He expanded the powers of the secret police, encouraged citizens to spy on one another and had millions of people killed or sent to the Gulag system of forced labor camps.
During the second half of the 1930s, Stalin instituted the Great Purge, a series of campaigns designed to rid the Communist Party, the military and other parts of Soviet society from those he considered a threat.
Additionally, Stalin built a cult of personality around himself in the Soviet Union. Cities were renamed in his honor. Soviet history books were rewritten to give him a more prominent role in the revolution and mythologize other aspects of his life.
Stalin was the subject of flattering artwork, literature and music, and his name became part of the Soviet national anthem. He censored photographs in an attempt to rewrite history, removing former associates executed during his many purges. His government also controlled the Soviet media.

Joseph Stalin and World War II
Battle of Stalingrad
In 1939, on the eve of World War II, Joseph Stalin and Germany’s Nazi Party dictator Adolf Hitler signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact. Stalin then proceeded to annex parts of Poland and Romania, as well as the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. He also launched an invasion of Finland.
Then, in June 1941, Germany broke the Nazi-Soviet pact and invaded the USSR, making significant early inroads. (Stalin had ignored warnings from the Americans and the British, as well as his own intelligence agents, about a potential invasion, and the Soviets were not prepared for war.)
As German troops approached the Soviet capital of Moscow, Stalin remained there and directed a scorched earth defensive policy, destroying any supplies or infrastructure that might benefit the enemy. The tide turned for the Soviets with the Battle of Stalingrad from August 1942 to February 1943, during which the Red Army defeated the Germans and eventually drove them from Russia.
As the war progressed, Stalin participated in the major Allied conferences, including the Tehran Conference (1943) and the Yalta Conference (1945). His iron will and deft political skills enabled him to play the loyal ally while never abandoning his vision of an expanded postwar Soviet empire.
Later Years
Joseph Stalin did not mellow with age: He initiated a reign of terror, purges, executions, exiles to labor camps and persecution in the postwar USSR, suppressing all dissent and anything that smacked of foreign–especially Western–influence.
He established communist governments throughout Eastern Europe, and in 1949 led the Soviets into the nuclear age by exploding an atomic bomb. In 1950, he gave North Korea’s communist leader Kim Il Sung permission to invade United States-supported South Korea, an event that triggered the Korean War.

How Did Joseph Stalin Die?
Stalin, who grew increasingly paranoid in his later years, died on March 5, 1953, at age 74, after suffering a stroke. His body was embalmed and preserved in Lenin’s mausoleum in Moscow’s Red Square until 1961, when it was removed and buried near the Kremlin walls as part of the de-Stalinization process initiated by Stalin’s successor Nikita Khrushchev (1894-1971).
How Many People Did Joseph Stalin Kill?
By some estimates, Joseph Stalin was responsible for the deaths of 6 million to 20 million people during his brutal rule, either though political executions or indirectly as a result of Stalin’s policies. The killings first began in the 1930s, as a wave of executions swept the Soviet Union during Stalin’s Great Purge.
“In some cases, a quota was established for the number to be executed, the number to be arrested,” said Stanford University history professor Norman Naimark in a 2010 interview. “Some officials overfulfilled as a way of showing their exuberance.”
Millions more were killed in the horrific famine that struck Ukraine in 1932-1933 and the Kazakh region from 1930 to 1933, as a of Stalin's cruel efforts to impose collectivism of agriculture and tamp down Ukrainian nationalism. Estimates vary, but about 4 million men, women and children are believed to have starved to death during the Holodomor (a combination of the Ukrainian words for “starvation” and “to inflict death”).

A Global Issue
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are toxic chemicals that adversely affect human health and the environment around the world. Because they can be transported by wind and water, most POPs generated in one country can and do affect people and wildlife far from where they are used and released. They persist for long periods of time in the environment and can accumulate and pass from one species to the next through the food chain. To address this global concern, the United States joined forces with 90 other countries and the European Community to sign a groundbreaking United Nations treatyExit EPA’s website in Stockholm, Sweden, in May 2001. Under the treaty, known as the Stockholm Convention, countries agreed to reduce or eliminate the production, use, and/or release of 12 key POPs (see box), and specified under the Convention a scientific review process that has led to the addition of other POPs chemicals of global concern.

2-Unintentionally Produced - Result from some industrial processes and combustion.

(For more information about the dirty dozen, see table below.) 
NOTE:  These are the chemicals initially addressed by the Stockholm Convention when negotiated.  Since that time, other chemicals have been added to the Convention.  See www.pops.int for the complete list.
Many of the POPs included in the Stockholm Convention are no longer produced in this country. However, U.S. citizens and habitats can still be at risk from POPs that have persisted in the environment from unintentionally produced POPs that are released in the United States, from POPs that are released elsewhere and then transported here (by wind or water, for example), or from both. Although most developed nations have taken strong action to control POPs, a great number of developing nations have only fairly recently begun to restrict their production, use, and release.
The Stockholm Convention adds an important global dimension to our national and regional efforts to control POPs. Though the United States is not yet a Party to the Stockholm Convention, the Convention has played a prominent role in the control of harmful chemicals on both a national and global level. For example, EPA and the states have significantly reduced the release of dioxins and furans to land, air, and water from U.S. sources. In addition to assessing dioxins, EPA has also been working diligently on the reduction of DDT from global sources. The United States and Canada signed an agreement for the Virtual Elimination of Persistent Toxic Substances in the Great Lakes to reduce emissions from toxic substances. The United States has also signed the regional protocol of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on POPs under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air PollutionExit EPA’s website which addresses the Stockholm Convention POPs and other chemicals.
In addition to the POPs-related agreements the United States has taken part in signing, the United States has also provided ample financial and technical support to countries across the globe supporting POPs reduction. A few of these initiatives include dioxin and furan release inventories in Asia and Russia, and the reduction of PCB sources in Russia. 
What Are POPs?
Many POPs were widely used during the boom in industrial production after World War II, when thousands of synthetic chemicals were introduced into commercial use. Many of these chemicals proved beneficial in pest and disease control, crop production, and industry. These same chemicals, however, have had unforeseen effects on human health and the environment.
Many people are familiar with some of the most well-known POPs, such as PCBs, DDT, and dioxins. POPs include a range of substances that include:
Intentionally produced chemicals currently or once used in agriculture, disease control, manufacturing, or industrial processes. Examples include PCBs, which have been useful in a variety of industrial applications (e.g., in electrical transformers and large capacitors, as hydraulic and heat exchange fluids, and as additives to paints and lubricants) and DDT, which is still used to control mosquitoes that carry malaria in some parts of the world.
Unintentionally produced chemicals, such as dioxins, that result from some industrial processes and from combustion (for example, municipal and medical waste incineration and backyard burning of trash).
The DDT Dilemma
DDT is likely one of the most famous and controversial pesticides ever made. An estimated 4 billion pounds of this inexpensive and historically effective chemical have been produced and applied worldwide since 1940. In the United States, DDT was used extensively on agricultural crops, particularly cotton, from 1945 to 1972. DDT was also used to protect soldiers from insect-borne diseases such as malaria and typhus during World War II, and it remains a valuable public health tool in parts of the tropics. The heavy use of this highly persistent chemical, however, led to widespread environmental contamination and the accumulation of DDT in humans and wildlife - a phenomenon brought to public attention by Rachel Carson in her 1962 book, Silent Spring. A wealth of scientific laboratory and field data have now confirmed research from the 1960s that suggested, among other effects, that high levels of DDE (a metabolite of DDT) in certain birds of prey caused their eggshells to thin so dramatically they could not produce live offspring.
One bird species especially sensitive to DDE was the bald eagle. Public concern about the eagles’ decline and the possibility of other long-term harmful effects of DDT exposure to both humans and wildlife prompted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to cancel the registration of DDT in 1972. The bald eagle has since experienced one of the most dramatic species recoveries in our history.
Transboundary Travelers
Global Dust: This figure shows a satellite image of the passage of a cloud of dust across the Pacific Ocean to North America. This dust cloud was raised by a storm in Asia in April 2001. Also shown is a dust cloud from northern Africa traveling west over the Atlantic Ocean.
A major impetus for the Stockholm Convention was the finding of POPs contamination in relatively pristine Arctic regions - thousands of miles from any known source. Much of the evidence for long-range transport of airborne gaseous and particulate substances to the United States focuses on dust or smoke because they are visible in satellite images. Tracing the movement of most POPs in the environment is complex because these compounds can exist in different phases (e.g., as a gas or attached to airborne particles) and can be exchanged among environmental media. For example, some POPs can be carried for many miles when they evaporate from water or land surfaces into the air, or when they adsorb to airborne particles. Then, they can return to Earth on particles or in snow, rain, or mist. POPs also travel through oceans, rivers, lakes, and, to a lesser extent, with the help of animal carriers, such as migratory species.
What Domestic Actions Have Been Taken to Control POPs?
The United States has taken strong domestic action to reduce emissions of POPs. For example, none of the original POPs pesticides listed in the Stockholm Convention is registered for sale and distribution in the United States today and in 1978, Congress prohibited the manufacture of PCBs and severely restricted the use of remaining PCB stocks. In addition, since 1987, EPA and the states have effectively reduced environmental releases of dioxins and furans to land, air, and water from U.S. sources. These regulatory actions, along with voluntary efforts by U.S. industry, resulted in a greater than 85 percent decline in total dioxin and furan releases after 1987 from known industrial sources. To better understand the risks associated with dioxin releases, EPA has been conducting a comprehensive reassessment of dioxin science and will be evaluating additional actions that might further protect human health and the environment.
Stopping DDT Use
Over the years, the United States has taken a number of steps to restrict the use of DDT:
1969: After studying the persistence of DDT residues in the environment, the U.S. Department of AgricultureExit EPA’s website (USDA)cancels the registration of certain uses of DDT (on shade trees, on tobacco, in the home, and in aquatic environments).

1970: USDA cancels DDT applications on crops, commercial plants, and wood products, as well as for building purposes.

1972: Under the authority of EPA, the registrations of the remaining DDT products are canceled.

1989: The remaining exempted uses (public health use for controlling vector-borne diseases, military use for quarantine, and prescription drug use for controlling body lice) are voluntarily stopped.

Today: There is no U.S. registration for DDT, meaning that it cannot legally be sold or distributed in the United States.
Controlling Dioxins
EPA has pursued regulatory control and management of dioxins and furans releases to air, water, and soil. The Clean Air Act requires the application of maximum achievable control technology for hazardous air pollutants, including dioxins and furans. Major sources regulated under this authority include municipal, medical, and hazardous waste incineration; pulp and paper manufacturing; and certain metals production and refining processes. Dioxin releases to water are managed through a combination of risk-based and technology-based tools established under the Clean Water Act. The cleanup of dioxin-contaminated land is an important part of the EPA Superfund and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action programs. Voluntary actions to control dioxins and furans include EPA’s Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxics Program and the Dioxin Exposure Initiative, both of which gather information to inform future actions and further reduce risks associated with dioxin exposure.
How Do POPs Affect People and Wildlife?
Studies have linked POPs exposures to declines, diseases, or abnormalities in a number of wildlife species, including certain kinds of fish, birds, and mammals. Wildlife also can act as sentinels for human health: abnormalities or declines detected in wildlife populations can sound an early warning bell for people. Behavioral abnormalities and birth defects in fish, birds, and mammals in and around the Great Lakes, for example, led scientists to investigate POPs exposures in human populations (see below for more information on the Great Lakes).
In people, reproductive, developmental, behavioral, neurologic, endocrine, and immunologic adverse health effects have been linked to POPs. People are mainly exposed to POPs through contaminated foods. Less common exposure routes include drinking contaminated water and direct contact with the chemicals. In people and other mammals alike, POPs can be transferred through the placenta and breast milk to developing offspring. It should be noted, however, that despite this potential exposure, the known benefits of breast-feeding far outweigh the suspected risks.
A number of populations are at particular risk of POPs exposure, including people whose diets include large amounts of fish, shellfish, or wild foods that are high in fat and locally obtained. For example, indigenous peoples may be particularly at risk because they observe cultural and spiritual traditions related to their diet. To them, fishing and hunting are not sport or recreation, but are part of a traditional, subsistence way of life, in which no useful part of the catch is wasted. In remote areas of Alaska and elsewhere, locally obtained subsistence food may be the only readily available option for nutrition (see below for more information on the Arctic).
In addition, sensitive populations, such as children, the elderly, and those with suppressed immune systems, are typically more susceptible to many kinds of pollutants, including POPs. Because POPs have been linked to reproductive impairments, men and women of child-bearing age may also be at risk.
POPS and the Food Chain
POPs work their way through the food chain by accumulating in the body fat of living organisms and becoming more concentrated as they move from one creature to another. This process is known as ""biomagnification."" When contaminants found in small amounts at the bottom of the food chain biomagnify, they can pose a significant hazard to predators that feed at the top of the food chain. This means that even small releases of POPs can have significant impacts.
Biomagnification in Action: A 1997 study by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment ProgrammeExit EPA’s website, called Arctic Pollution Issues: A State of the Arctic Environment Report, found that caribou in Canada’s Northwest Territories had as much as 10 times the levels of PCBs as the lichen on which they grazed; PCB levels in the wolves that fed on the caribou were magnified nearly 60 times as much as the lichen.
The Role of Science
Although scientists have more to learn about POPs chemicals, decades of scientific research have greatly increased our knowledge of POPs’ impacts on people and wildlife. For example, laboratory studies have shown that low doses of certain POPs adversely affect some organ systems and aspects of development. Studies also have shown that chronic exposure to low doses of certain POPs can result in reproductive and immune system deficits. Exposure to high levels of certain POPs chemicals - higher than normally encountered by humans and wildlife - can cause serious damage or death. Epidemiological studies of exposed human populations and studies of wildlife might provide more information on health impacts. However, because such studies are less controlled than laboratory studies, other stresses cannot be ruled out as the cause of adverse effects.
As we continue to study POPs, we will learn more about the risk of POPs exposure to the general public, how much certain species (including people) are exposed, and what effects POPs have on these species and their ecosystems. EPA developed a report summarizing the science on POPs (see Resources below).
Reservoirs of POPs
POPs can be deposited in marine and freshwater ecosystems through effluent releases, atmospheric deposition, runoff, and other means. Because POPs have low water solubility, they bond strongly to particulate matter in aquatic sediments. As a result, sediments can serve as reservoirs or ""sinks"" for POPs. When sequestered in these sediments, POPs can be taken out of circulation for long periods of time. If disturbed, however, they can be reintroduced into the ecosystem and food chain, potentially becoming a source of local, and even global, contamination.
The Great Lakes: A Story of Trials and Triumphs
The Great Lakes - Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario - and their connecting channels make up the largest system of fresh surface water in the world. A vital resource for the United States and Canada, the Great Lakes are used for fishing, swimming, boating, agriculture, industry, and tourism; they are also a source of drinking water and energy.
Despite their size, however, the Great Lakes are vulnerable to pollution. Until the 1970s, a variety of POPs, heavy metals, and other agricultural and industrial pollutants were routinely discharged into the Great Lakes. Toxic substances also entered the Great Lakes Basin through other avenues, including waste sites, river runoff, and atmospheric deposition. These pollutants existed in large enough quantities to warrant concern regarding the effects on human health and wildlife, including several species of fish and shellfish, bald eagles and other birds of prey, and fish-eating mammals such as mink.
Extensive cleanup and pollution control efforts were subsequently launched, and many contaminant levels have declined dramatically in the Great Lakes as a result, illustrating the positive outcomes that can be achieved when communities, government, and industry work together to reduce pollution. Still, some POPs exist at significant concentrations, indicating their persistence and the possibility of continued contamination from other sources, particularly long-range atmospheric transport of POPs from other areas.
In 1972, the United States and Canada signed the first Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, calling for the two countries to clean up and control pollution of these waters. In 1978, they signed a new agreement, which added a commitment to work together to rid the Great Lakes of persistent toxic chemicals, some of which are POPs. As part of this agreement, both countries have been monitoring atmospheric loadings of these chemicals to the Great Lakes since 1990.
The Great Lakes Binational Toxics Strategy, signed by the United States and Canada in 1997, was an agreement aimed to reduce several persistent toxic pollutants, including certain POPs, in the Great Lakes Basin over a 10-year period. The strategy provided a guide for governments and stakeholders toward the virtual elimination of 12 identified substances through cost-efficient and expedient pollution prevention and other incentive-based actions. Over the course of the ten-year period, working closely with state, provincial, tribal, and local governments and stakeholders from industry, academia, environmental and community groups, both governments made significant progress in meeting that goal of virtually eliminating persistent toxic substances such as mercury, PCBs, and dioxin from discharging into the Great Lakes environment. The two governments agreed to continue to extend the agreement in order to work together to identify new challenges that are presented by emerging substance of concern, such as flame retardants.
Great Lakes Research
Through these efforts, we will steadily continue to reduce levels of toxics in fish. Someday we will answer the question . . . that, yes, Great Lakes fish are safe to eat by anyone, anywhere.
Today, much of our knowledge of POPs, populations at risk, and possible health effects comes from research conducted in the Great Lakes region. We have learned, for example, that a major route of exposure is through contaminated food, particularly fish. Studies conducted in the 1970s showed a correlation between fish consumption and elevated POPs levels in blood, leading researchers to conclude that people can be exposed to POPs by eating contaminated fish.
As a result, extensive fish contaminant monitoring programs have been established in the Great Lakes states, and fish consumption advisories are regularly released to help inform people which fish are safe to eat and how much is safe to eat (see Resources below).
We have also learned that currently some POPs primarily enter the Great Lakes from the air and that urban areas are major sources of airborne POPs.
Alaska: POPs in America’s Arctic
For many Americans, Alaska (much of which is in the Arctic) conjures images of commanding tundra, glaciers, and pure coastal waters - a remote and wild land relatively untouched by the human hand. But even here, POPs have been found in the air, water, soil, plants, fish, and other wildlife.
Some POPs have been used or released in Alaska and other northern regions by military sites, smelters, pulp and paper mills, power stations, mines, and other sources. Others have rarely or never been used locally.
POPs can enter Alaska and the Arctic in several ways, too. The first indication that Arctic pollution could originate elsewhere came during the 1950s, when pilots noticed a haze in the North American Arctic that was eventually traced to sources in the lower latitudes. Since then, scientists have discovered that POPs can reach Arctic regions via air, water, and, to a lesser extent, migratory species.
Due to global wind patterns, Alaska can receive POPs from both east Asia and northern Europe. POPs can also travel in rivers from southeast and central Asia into the Pacific Ocean, where water currents flow into the Arctic Ocean.
Alaska’s expansive tundra and close proximity to the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean make it a home for a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are at particular risk from POPs. During the long, cold Alaskan winters, mammals metabolize fat, and this process releases POPs that have accumulated in the fat directly into their bodies. Then, in the spring, a critical period of reproduction for Alaskan wildlife, POPs that have accumulated in the ice and snow can be released into the environment and the food chain.
The Alaskan and Arctic ecosystems are fragile and take a long time to recover from damage. In addition, slow-growing plants (and the animals that feed on these plants) can be exposed to bioaccumulating contaminants such as POPs for a long time before being consumed at the next level in the food chain. For example, POPs accumulation in and on lichen in Alaska may contribute to levels of contaminants found in caribou tissue. The caribou, in turn, can then be exposed to these contaminants for a long time before being consumed by predators themselves.
Living Close to the Land
The traditional Alaskan Native’s way of life is rooted in a close relationship with the land. For many Native cultures, subsistence activities (such as hunting seals, whales, and birds; fishing; and gathering bird eggs) are the main methods of procuring food. Alaskan Natives therefore consume much more fish than the average American and more often consume animals higher on the food chain, including predator species such as seals, sea lions, bears, and toothed whales, all of which have potentially higher levels of POPs.
Cooperation in the Arctic
In 1991, nations with territory in the Arctic developed the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy to protect, enhance, and restore the Arctic ecosystems. In 1996, those same nations established the Arctic Council, a high-level intergovernmental forum, to address environmental protection and sustainable development in the Arctic. The member nations of the Council are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Russia, Iceland, Sweden, and the United States. The Arctic Council Action Plan has launched a number of projects to reduce the use and release of POPs within the Arctic nations. The Arctic Council’s Arctic Monitoring and Assessment ProgrammeExit EPA’s website (AMAP) provides member nations with information on threats to the Arctic environment and scientific advice on remedial and preventive actions to protect the environment from contaminants such as POPs.
The Stockholm Convention
On May 23, 2001, Christine Todd Whitman, then-EPA Administrator, signed the Convention for the United States in Stockholm, Sweden
The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which was adopted in 2001 and entered into force in 2004, is a global treaty whose purpose is to safeguard human health and the environment from highly harmful chemicals that persist in the environment and affect the well-being of humans as well as wildlife. The Convention requires parties to eliminate and/or reduce POPs, which have a potential of causing devastating effects such as cancer and diminished intelligence and have the ability to travel over great distances.
The Stockholm Convention is managed by the United Nations Environment ProgramExit EPA’s website  and its Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland. UNEP is the leading international environmental entity that supports the agenda and implementation of environmental sustainability for the United Nations. The COP, or the Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention, governs the POPs Convention, with its members being the Convention’s Parties.
The role of Parties is to implement the obligations of the Convention, including eliminating or restricting the production and use of the intentionally produced POPs, prohibiting and eliminating production and use or import of POPs, conducting research, identifying areas contaminated with POPs, and providing financial support and incentives for the Convention. The process of becoming a Party begins with a state or regional economic integration organization submitting a means of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession to the depositary. Official contact points and national focal points are nominated to carry out administrative, communications, and information exchange procedures.
While the Convention initially focused on 12 intentionally and unintentionally produced chemicals (see list above), the Convention began adding additional substances to the agreement in May of 2009 and will continue to do so. For the most updated list of substances covered by the Convention, please visit www.pops.intExit EPA’s website. 
Intentionally Produced POPs
In the United States, the treaty is of particular importance for the people and environment of Alaska, which are impacted by POPs transported by air and water from outside the state. This is particularly true for Alaskan Natives, who rely heavily on traditional diets consisting of fish and wildlife.
The Convention requires Parties to eliminate or restrict the production and use of the intentionally produced POPs, subject to specified exemptions, with special provisions for DDT and PCBs.
DDT is placed in the restriction annex, which means that its production and use is restricted to disease-vector control. The Convention also establishes a public DDT registry of users and producers, and it encourages the development of safe, effective, affordable, and environmentally friendly alternatives.
For PCBs, the Convention prohibits new PCB production and envisages phasing out electrical equipment that contains high concentrations of PCBs by 2025.
Trade
The Convention prohibits trade in POPs chemicals for which Parties have eliminated production and use. Such POPs may be exported only for environmentally sound disposal. For those POPs that one or more Parties continue to produce or use pursuant to specific exemptions, the Convention allows export of such POPs only to those Parties that have an allowed use exemption under the Convention and those non-Parties that provide certification that they will minimize or prevent environmental releases and destroy or dispose of the POPs in an environmentally sound manner.
Exemptions/Exceptions for Intentionally Produced POPs
The Convention generally exempts from the previously described requirements those quantities of intentionally produced POPs that:
Are used for laboratory-scale research or as a reference standard.
Occur as unintentional trace contaminants in products and articles.
Are used in closed-system, site-limited processes.
Exist in articles manufactured or already in use on the date that the Convention enters into force for that Party.
The Convention also allows Parties to register for specific exemptions on a country-by-country basis. These exemptions are subject to review and expire after 5 years, unless extended by the Conference of Parties (COP).
Unintentionally Produced POPs
The Convention calls upon Parties to take certain specified measures to reduce releases of unintentionally produced POPs with the goal of their continuing minimization and, where feasible, ultimate elimination. It specifically requires Parties to:
Develop national action plans to address the release of these POPs.
Promote the development of preventative measures.
Apply best available techniques (BAT) for certain new pollution sources (e.g., municipal, hospital, and hazardous waste incinerators) within 4 years after the Convention enters into force. Parties must also promote BAT and best environmental practices for other new and existing sources.
POPs Wastes
Among other things, the Convention requires Parties to develop appropriate strategies for identifying:
Stockpiles consisting of or containing intentionally produced POPs chemicals.
Products and articles in use and wastes consisting of, containing, or contaminated with any POPs chemical.
Sites contaminated with POPs.
It also requires Parties to take appropriate measures so that POPs wastes are managed in an environmentally sound manner. This includes both destruction and disposal techniques. Although remediation of contaminated sites is not required, any such remediation must be performed in an environmentally sound manner.
Financial and Technical Assistance
The Convention creates a flexible system of technical and financial aid to help developing countries and countries with economies in transition to meet their obligations. Although the Convention does not create a new fund or establish specific assessments, developed countries are to collectively provide new and additional financial resources. These funds will enable developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures to fulfill their obligations under the Convention. On an interim basis, the Convention designates the Global Environment Facility (GEF) as the primary, but not exclusive, component of the financial mechanism. The GEF is a financial mechanism established to address global environmental threats.
The Convention also specifies that developed countries provide technical assistance and capacity building to help developing countries and countries with economies in transition meet their obligations.
Process for Adding New Chemicals
New chemicals can be added to the treaty based on a scientific review procedure that involves Parties and interested observers. The basic steps of the process are as follows:
When a Party nominates a chemical, the proposal is sent to a scientific review committee comprised of government- designated experts, who apply the Convention’s screening criteria (for persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and long-range transport).
If the chemical meets the screening criteria, the committee prepares a risk profile for the chemical.
If, on the basis of the risk profile, the committee finds that the ""chemical is likely, as a result of its long-range environmental transport to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects such that global action is warranted,"" the committee prepares a risk management evaluation that considers socio-economic factors.
Based on the risk profile and the risk management evaluation, the review committee makes a recommendation to the COP whether the chemical should be listed or not listed under the Convention.
The COP makes the final decision -by three-fourths majority - as to whether the chemical will be listed under the Convention.
The decision of the COP to add a chemical to the treaty is binding on all Parties 1 year later, except for (a) Parties that ""opt out"" of this decision within the 1-year period, or (b) Parties that choose to invoke a separate ""opt in"" procedure under which they are not bound until they affirmatively accept a new obligation. The COP began adding new chemicals to the agreement in May of 2009.
Monitoring Process
The Convention provides for an effectiveness evaluation, based on a POPs monitoring and data collection effort that will use existing monitoring programs and mechanisms to the extent possible.

  What Has the United States Done to Address POPs Globally?
The United States has taken a leading role to reduce and/or eliminate POPs and their releases on a regional and global basis. Below are some highlights of our efforts.
Canada and the United States signed an agreement for the Virtual Elimination of Persistent Toxic Substances in the Great Lakes. The strategy sets long-term goals to promote emissions reductions of toxic substances.
The United States, Canada, and Mexico established the Commission for Environmental CooperationExit EPA’s website (CEC)  under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC)Exit EPA’s website (PDF) (40 pp, 75 K, About PDF),  which in turn developed a regional initiative on the sound management of chemicals. Under this initiative, the CEC has developed Regional Action PlansExit EPA’s website,  which identify activities that reduce or eliminate risks from chemicals of concern. The CEC, for example, established such plans for PCBs, DDT, and chlordane.
The United States signed the legally binding regional protocol with other member nations (including European countries, Canada, and Russia) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on POPs under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air PollutionExit EPA’s website (LRTAP) . This agreement seeks to eliminate production and reduce emissions of POPs in the UNECE region. The original agreement addressed the 12 Stockholm Convention POPs and 4 additional chemicals (hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexabromobiphenyl, chlordecone, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), but, like the Stockholm Convention, included a mechanism for adding additional substances to the agreement. Elements from the LRTAP POPs Protocol were used in negotiations for the Stockholm Convention. The United States has not yet ratified the Protocol.
Other international work has addressed trade in hazardous substances, some of which are POPs. The United States, along with 71 other countries and the European Community, have signed the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International TradeExit EPA’s website , building on a 10-year-old voluntary program. The PIC Convention identifies pesticides and industrial chemicals of concern, facilitates information sharing about their risks, and provides countries with an opportunity to make informed decisions about whether they should be imported. Some of the POP substances are already on the PIC list.
The United States has also provided technical and financial assistance for POPs-related activities to a variety of countries and regions, including Mexico, Central and South America, Russia, Asia, and Africa. Examples of this assistance include development of dioxin and furan release inventories in Russia and Asia, the Chemicals Information Exchange and Networking Project for chemicals managers in targeted countries in Africa and Central America, the destruction of pesticide stockpiles in Africa and Russia, and the reduction of PCB sources in Russia, which reduced emissions of PCBs and enabled Russia to meet the requirements of both the Stockholm Convention and the LRTAP POPs Protocol.
The United States is also an observer to the Basel ConventionExit EPA’s website , which was designed to reduce cross-border movements of hazardous waste. The Convention focuses on improving controls on the movement of waste, including some POPs waste, preventing illegal traffic, and ensuring that waste is disposed of as close as possible to its source.

On October 18, 1867, the U.S. formally takes possession of Alaska after purchasing the territory from Russia for $7.2 million, or less than two cents an acre. Indigenous peoples had settled the unforgiving territory thousands of years earlier. The Alaska purchase comprised 586,412 square miles, about twice the size of Texas, and was championed by William Henry Seward, the enthusiastically expansionist secretary of state under President Andrew Johnson.
Russia wanted to sell its Alaska territory, which was remote and difficult to defend, to the U.S. rather than risk losing it in battle with a rival such as Great Britain. Negotiations between Seward (1801-1872) and the Russian minister to the U.S., Eduard de Stoeckl, began in March 1867. However, the American public believed the land to be barren and worthless and dubbed the purchase “Seward’s Folly” and “Andrew Johnson’s Polar Bear Garden,” among other derogatory names. Some animosity toward the project may have been a byproduct of President Johnson’s own unpopularity. As the 17th U.S. president, Johnson battled with Radical Republicans in Congress over Reconstruction policies following the Civil War. He was impeached in 1868 and later acquitted by a single vote. Nevertheless, Congress eventually ratified the Alaska deal.

Public opinion of the purchase turned more favorable when gold was discovered in Nome, Alaska, in 1899, sparking a gold rush. Alaska became the 49th state on January 3, 1959, and is now recognized for its vast natural resources. Today, 25 percent of America’s oil and over 50 percent of its seafood come from Alaska. It is also the largest state in area, about one-fifth the size of the lower 48 states combined, though it remains sparsely populated.
The name Alaska is derived from the Aleut word alyeska, which means “great land.” Alaska has two official state holidays to commemorate its origins: Seward’s Day, observed the last Monday in March, celebrates the March 30, 1867, signing of the land treaty between the U.S. and Russia, and Alaska Day, observed every October 18, marks the anniversary of the formal land transfer.

Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: Background
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: March 3, 1918
On March 3, 1918, in the city of Brest-Litovsk, located in modern-day Belarus near the Polish border, Russia signed a treaty with the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria) ending its participation in World War I (1914-18). With the November 11, 1918, armistice ending World War I and marking the Allies’ victory over Germany, the treaty was annulled. By the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, Germany was forced to give up its territorial gains from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: Background
Russia’s involvement in World War I alongside its allies, France and Britain, had resulted in a number of heavy losses against Germany, offset only partially by consistent victories against Austria-Hungary. Defeat on the battlefield fed the growing discontent among the bulk of Russia’s population, especially the poverty-stricken workers and peasants, and its hostility toward the imperial regime, led by the ineffectual Czar Nicholas II (1868-1918). This discontent strengthened the cause of the Bolsheviks, a radical socialist group led by Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924) that was working to harness opposition to the czar and turn it into a sweeping revolution that would begin in Russia and later, he hoped, spread to the rest of the world.
Did you know? Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky was exiled from the Soviet Union in the late 1920s after losing a power struggle with Joseph Stalin. Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico in 1940 by a Spanish-born Soviet agent.
The February Revolution broke out in early March 1917 (or February, according to the Julian calendar, which the Russians used at the time); Nicholas abdicated later that month. After Lenin’s return from exile (aided by the Germans) in mid-April, he and his fellow Bolsheviks worked quickly to seize power from the provisional government, led by Alexander Kerensky, Russia’s minister of war. In early November, aided by the Russian military, they were successful. One of Lenin’s first actions as leader was to call a halt to Russian participation in the war.
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: March 3, 1918
An armistice was reached in early December 1917 and a formal cease-fire was declared December 15, but determining the terms of peace between Russia and the Central Powers proved to be far more complicated. Negotiations began at Brest-Litovsk on December 22. Leading their respective delegations were foreign ministers Leon Trotsky (1879-1940) of Russia, Richard von Kuhlmann of Germany and Count Ottokar Czernin of Austria.
In mid-February, the talks broke down when an angry Trotsky deemed the Central Powers’ terms too harsh and their demands for territory unacceptable. Fighting resumed briefly on the Eastern Front, but the German armies advanced quickly, and both Lenin and Trotsky soon realized that Russia, in its weakened state, would be forced to give in to the enemy terms. Negotiations resumed later that month and the final treaty was signed on March 3, 1918.
By the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Russia recognized the independence of Ukraine, Georgia and Finland; gave up Poland and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to Germany and Austria-Hungary; and ceded Kars, Ardahan and Batum to Turkey. The total losses constituted some 1 million square miles of Russia’s former territory; a third of its population or around 55 million people; a majority of its coal, oil and iron stores; and much of its industry. Lenin bitterly called the settlement “that abyss of defeat, dismemberment, enslavement and humiliation.”

""Where the Blame Lies""
Labor struggles were not the only conflicts Italian immigrants faced. During the years of the great Italian immigration, they also had to confront a wave of virulent prejudice and nativist hostility.
As immigration from Europe and Asia neared its crest in the late 19th century, anti-immigrant sentiment soared along with it. The U.S. was in the grips of an economic depression, and immigrants were blamed for taking American jobs. At the same time, racialist theories circulated in the press, advancing pseudo scientific theories that alleged that ""Mediterranean"" types were inherently inferior to people of northern European heritage. Drawings and songs caricaturing the new immigrants as childlike, criminal, or subhuman became sadly commonplace. One 1891 cartoon claimed that ""If immigration was properly restricted, you would never be troubled with anarchism, socialism, the Mafia and such kindred evils!""
Italian American neighborhood, New Orleans, ca. 1906
Attacks on Italians were not limited to the printed page, however. From the late 1880s, anti-immigrant societies sprang up around the country, and the Ku Klux Klan saw a spike in membership. Catholic churches and charities were vandalized and burned, and Italians attacked by mobs. In the 1890s alone, more than 20 Italians were lynched.
One of the bloodiest episodes took place in New Orleans in 1891. When the chief of police was found shot to death on the street one night, the mayor blamed ""Sicilian gangsters"" and rounded up more than 100 Sicilian Americans. Eventually, 19 were put on trial and, as the nation's Italian Americans watched nervously, were found not guilty for lack of evidence. Before they could be freed, however, a mob of 10,000 people, including many of New Orleans' most prominent citizens, broke into the jail. They dragged 11 Sicilians from their cells and lynched them, including two men jailed on other offenses.
Anti-immigrant sentiment continued until the 1920s, when severe restrictions on immigration were put into place by the U.S. Congress. When this legislation passed, the great era of Italian immigration came to an end.

Abstract
The treatment of war wounds is an ancient art, constantly refined to reflect improvements in weapons technology, transportation, antiseptic practices, and surgical techniques. Throughout most of the history of warfare, more soldiers died from disease than combat wounds, and misconceptions regarding the best timing and mode of treatment for injuries often resulted in more harm than good. Since the 19th century, mortality from war wounds steadily decreased as surgeons on all sides of conflicts developed systems for rapidly moving the wounded from the battlefield to frontline hospitals where surgical care is delivered. We review the most important trends in US and Western military trauma management over two centuries, including the shift from primary to delayed closure in wound management, refinement of amputation techniques, advances in evacuation philosophy and technology, the development of antiseptic practices, and the use of antibiotics. We also discuss how the lessons of history are reflected in contemporary US practices in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Introduction
The need for surgical care of survivors of accidents or animal attacks is part of the story of civilization, as is the story of medical care of those wounded in that other peculiarly human endeavor, warfare [41]. During the past 250 years, and particularly during the 20th century, developments in military trauma care for musculoskeletal injuries have greatly influenced civilian emergency medicine. The history of military trauma care must be understood in terms of the wounding power of weapons causing the injury and how the surgeon understood the healing process. Improvements in weapons technology forced surgeons to rethink their interventions in their effort to tip the odds of survival in favor of their patient.
Our purpose is to review the evolution of military trauma care during the past two and a half centuries in major conflicts in the West. The major areas of emphasis are medical evacuation and organization; wounds and wound management; surgical technique and technology, with a particular focus on amputation; infection and antibiotics; and blood transfusion.

Medical Evacuation and Organization
Perhaps the most basic problem facing physicians during wartime historically has been whether (and how) to transport the wounded to care or transport the caregivers to the wounded. A secondary problem historically has been how best to organize the delivery of care as modern nations began to dispatch vast armies and navies to fight across vast distances.
For example, Pikoulis et al. [110] reviewed the wounds depicted in The Iliad and determined the arrow wounds such as the one suffered by Menelaus carried a mortality rate of 42%, slingshot wounds 67%, spear wounds 80%, and sword wounds 100%. These high mortality rates suggest surgeons were unable to get to wounded soldiers during the melee, treating only the higher class or those who survived after the battle had concluded. These Greek surgeons, whether they realized it or not, faced the same issues as all future practitioners engaged in wound care: wound management, The Golden Hour (the principle that a victim’s chances of survival are greatest if he receives resuscitation within the first hour after a severe injury), and infection control.
During the American Revolution (1775–1783), the Continental Congress authorized one surgeon to serve in each regiment. Few of the regimental surgeons, mostly trained through the apprenticeship system as there were only two medical schools in the United States (King’s College [now Columbia University] in New York, NY, and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA), had any experience treating trauma. The organization was minimal, and regimental surgeons tended to work for their unit instead of seeing themselves as part of the Hospital Department, which was rendered ineffective by bureaucratic infighting [116].
The outstanding military surgeon of the Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815), Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey (1766–1842), generally is regarded as the originator of modern military trauma care and what would become known as triage [131]. He placed surgical teams near the front lines to shorten the time elapsed after injury and instituted specially designed horse-drawn “flying ambulances” in which the wounded rode with an early version of emergency medical technicians [67, 103]. Care was prioritized to provide first for the most badly wounded, without regard to the patient’s chances of survival or the need to restore less gravely wounded soldiers to the front lines quickly [11]. After Larrey’s system was used during the Battle of Metz (1793), he was ordered to organize medical care for the entire French Army [131]. Rapid access to care and immediate amputation reduced morbidity and mortality.
The Crimean War (1854–1855) underscored the importance of methods used by Larrey decades earlier, particularly the importance of organized evacuation and surgical care close to the front line. The war revealed a stark contrast between the battlefield care provided by the French, with their expert organization and system of light ambulances, and the poorly organized British Medical Services. Outrage over the poor treatment offered to the British wounded led the War Office to send a young nurse, Florence Nightingale (1820–1910), and a staff of 38 volunteers to the British barracks in Istanbul, Turkey, where Nightingale’s first act was to thoroughly scrub the hospital, provide clean bedding, improve ventilation and sewage disposal, and reorganize everyday sanitary procedures. She was an early theorist of sanitation and the design of hospital buildings. Although her efforts created intense resentment in the army bureaucracy, she was one of the founders of the modern nursing profession [48]. She broke the monopoly of health care as the sole providence of the physician, which led to the development of the healthcare team in modern medical practice.
Nikolai Pirogoff (1810–1881), who served in the Imperial Russian Army, brought skilled nurses into military hospitals and worked to modernize Russian medical equipment [133]. He is the namesake for a conservative technique of foot amputation [98].
At the onset of the American Civil War (1861–1865), the US Army and Navy combined had about 100 physicians, many with no experience with battlefield trauma [87], almost 30 of whom resigned to join the Confederacy [45]. The structure of the Medical Department was decentralized with no clear chain of command and control of supplies. The US Army Quartermaster’s Corps, whose primary duties were supplying and provisioning troops, were responsible for direct battlefield evacuation. The Regimental Band served as litter bearers. The first Battle of Manassas (July 21, 1861) was a rout for the federal forces and the soldiers fled back to Washington. Ultimately, 2708 men were killed or wounded and the Medical Department could not handle the load. Regimental surgeons, because they worked for their unit only, were either swamped with casualties or idle. Regimental band members and civilian ambulance drivers hired by the quartermaster’s corps fled from the battle. Most of the wounded had to walk the 27-mile distance from the battlefield to Washington to reach the hospitals in the rear. Those who could not walk remained on the battlefield for several days until they were picked up by ambulances, captured by Confederate forces, or died [62].
The Union Army quickly reorganized its Medical Department in 1862 after prodding by a Sanitary Commission created by President Lincoln [124]. Jonathan Letterman (1824–1872) (Fig. 1) reorganized the medical care in the Army of the Potomac. Wounded soldiers were removed from the battlefield by litter bearer, the predecessor to the medic or corpsman. Regimental Surgeons were responsible for dressing wounds and patients were evacuated in ambulances driven by Medical Corps noncommissioned officers to a division level field hospital for surgical treatment. By the end of the war, the Medical Department expanded this system by creating a national network of hospital trains, hospital ships, and general hospitals that could treat the patient near his hometown if he so desired [62]. The main advance in American medicine during the Civil War was the creation of an effective military medical corps with medical evacuation, hospitals, and surgical specialists. Health care was beginning to become a system. Still missing was a formalized approach to care that recognized the severity of injuries. The poet Walt Whitman, who worked at several Union hospitals in Washington, DC, noted, “The men, whatever their condition, lie there, and patiently wait until their turn comes to be taken up” [144]. Whitman’s poem “The Wound Dresser” (1865) poignantly illustrates the state of care at the time (Appendix 1).

Johann Friedrich August von Esmarch (1823–1908) served as a young surgeon in German campaigns against Denmark in 1848 and 1864 and was appointed surgeon general during the war against France in 1870. His contributions to military medicine were comprehensive, from initial management of wounds, to surgical techniques, to the organizational structure of patient management. In the late 19th century, von Esmarch continued the development of organized trauma care pioneered by Larrey, who as early as 1812 had introduced clear rules for sorting patients: the dangerously wounded would receive first attention, regardless of rank; those with less acute injuries would be treated second. Historically, priority of care for the wounded may have depended on the rank of the injured soldier, an individual surgeon’s best guess, the order of arrival, or happenstance. von Esmarch emphasized prioritizing patients by severity of injury but did so to make the most effective use of medical resources, not necessarily to treat the most badly injured first [42]. The familiar concept of triage (from the French “trier”, to sort) would be given its name by French physicians in World War I [77], but institution of a rationalized approach to prioritizing care was a decades-long development, from Larrey to von Esmarch to the massive armies of World War I.
The then-unprecedented mass casualties in World War I (1914–1919), with horrific wounds from machine guns and shell fragments, and the effects of poison gas, created terrific strains on British and French medical units. The advent of motorized transport helped make possible the establishment of British Casualty Clearing Stations (CCS) approximately 6 to 9 miles behind the front lines. These were advanced surgical units, staffed by surgeons, anesthetists, and nurses—the closest women had gotten to the front lines in a modern conflict [41]. The stations were designed to admit between 150 and 400 wounded at a time, but they often were overwhelmed with 1000 or more patients. Increasingly, instead of the most badly injured patients being given priority in triage, the time required to provide such treatment compelled British surgeons to prioritize in favor of patients with critical but less complicated wounds [77]. A British manual listed the goals of triage as first conservation of manpower and secondly the interests of the wounded [146].
As US Surgeon General during most of World War II (1939–1945), Norman Kirk (1888–1960) (Fig. 2) oversaw a medical organization more vast than any of his predecessors: 535,000 medics, 57,000 nurses, 47,000 physicians, and 2000 veterinarians. Nearly 700 overseas hospitals were responsible for initial care of the wounded. Stateside, 78 military hospitals cared for nearly 600,000 patients during the war [101]. The chain of care began with combat medics, two of which generally were assigned to each company. They provided initial care and determined whether a wound required evacuation of the patient to a battalion aid station. If additional treatment were required, the patient was evacuated to a divisional clearing station, where the first formal triage of patients occurred and which also served as small surgical hospitals for urgent cases [28]. Definitive care took place at one of the overseas hospitals or a military hospital stateside, in the “Zone of the Interior.”

The US Army Medical Department was in the process of reorganizing based on experiences of World War II when the Korean War (1950–1953) began. New Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) units were developed rapidly under the leadership of the pioneering surgeon Michael DeBakey (1908–1999) to provide resuscitative surgical care within 10 miles of the front lines (Fig. 3). Helicopter ambulance companies supported the MASH, allowing treatment of patients within 3 to 12 hours of wounding [73]. Mortality from all wounds decreased to a low of 2.4% [39], with mortality from abdominal wounds decreasing to 8.8% [116].

Improvements in medical evacuation technology and organization, particularly the use of helicopters, again played a major role for US forces in Vietnam (1962–1974). Medics splinted and bandaged the wounded patient, frequently radioing the hospital and warning of his arrival and diagnosis. Helicopter evacuation minimized the use of morphine, eliminating an additional complication. The hospital mortality rate was slightly higher than in Korea, 2.6%, but that increase is probably misleading, as more rapid transport delivered wounded soldiers who would have been listed as killed in action in Korea [99]. Mortality from abdominal wounds declined to 4.5% [58]. Most soldiers wounded in Vietnam were delivered from the battlefield to fixed hospitals with the capacity to provide definitive treatment, eliminating the need for multiple transfers and levels of care (Fig. 4). Patients not expected to return to full duty within 30 days or less were evacuated to hospitals in Japan and the United States [60].

Casualties arrive at the Naval Support Activity Station Hospital in Da Nang, Vietnam, in 1968. The wounded were transferred from the helicopters to the triage area on canvas-covered stretchers. These were set on sawhorses, where they became examination tables and sometimes operating tables. (From Kelly PJ. Vietnam, 1968–69: a place and year like no other. Neurosurgery. 2003;52:927–943.

The nature of combat and improvements in evacuation during the Korean and Vietnam conflicts thus allowed for development of fixed hospitals. Although MASH units continued to provide care, the hospitals grew from 60 beds at the beginning of the Korean War to 200-bed fixed hospitals with metal buildings and concrete floors as the fighting settled into trench warfare by 1952. By 1990, the weight of all of the equipment for a MASH unit was more than 200,000 pounds, meaning the hospital was mobile in name only. Unlike previous wars, armies of the Persian Gulf War (1990–1991) moved rapidly, and even though several MASH units were staged in trucks, hospitals were unable to keep up with the rapidly advancing front. Although there were few casualties, it was painfully obvious MASH units were too cumbersome to effectively support armored units as they raced into Kuwait and southern Iraq. A new organizational structure was needed [100]. A 20-person Forward Surgical Team (FST) was created to provide resuscitative surgery close to the front lines. The role of the fixed-base hospital was taken by a Combat Support Hospital (CSH), a modular unit capable of supporting between 44 and 248 beds. The reorganization was completed in 2003 when the 212th MASH becoming the 212th CSH while in Iraq [100].
Trauma care for US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan currently is provided through five levels of care: Level I, front line first aid; Level II, FST; Level III, CSH, which is similar to civilian trauma centers; Level IV, surgical hospitals outside the combat zone, such as Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany; and Level V, major US military hospitals, such as Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC; The National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD; San Diego Naval Medical Center in San Diego, CA; and Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, TX (Table 1) [6]. At the front line, each squad has a combat lifesaver trained in resuscitation, and each soldier is equipped with a tourniquet. If surgical resuscitation is required, the patient is immediately moved to a higher level of care (Fig. 5A). Level III army hospitals are large (248 beds), with surgical specialists, laboratories, radiology, and blood banks. Definitive surgical treatment can be provided first at a Level IV hospital but may be provided at Level V, where limb salvage and reconstructive surgery are performed. All amputees begin rehabilitation at a Level V hospital; burn patients are sent exclusively to Brooke Army Medical Center. The military C-17 transports that have become known as the flying ICUs are capable of bringing the wounded to the United States in as little as 3 days of their wounding, although the actual number of days varies according to the individual patient’s requirements (Fig. 5B) [63].

Wounds and Wound Management
Perhaps the earliest literary account of wound management comes from Homer’s epic poem The Iliad (circa 700 BCE), based on events of the Trojan War half a millennium earlier [70]. Combat during this period was chaotic, as opposing formations merged into hand-to-hand combat with edged weapons resulting in heavy casualties. The accounts depict surgeons as skilled and professional physicians who expertly treated wartime trauma. In the fourth book of The Iliad, surgeon Makaon treated King Menelaus of Sparta, who had sustained an arrow wound to the abdomen, by extracting the arrow, sucking blood out of the wound to remove poison [76], and applying a salve [70]. In the eleventh book, Achilles’ friend Patroclus extracted an arrow from King Eurypylus of Thessaly, when he “cut out with a knife the bitter, sharp arrow from his thigh, and washed the black blood from it with warm water” [70], which may have been the first record of débridement and soft tissue management (Appendix 2).
One of the longest-enduring rules of wound care, one that would have implications for centuries, came from the works of Hippocrates (460–477 BCE), whose extensive writings included such innovations as chest tubes for drainage, external fixation, and traction to restore proper alignment of fractured bones and important observations about head trauma. Hippocrates believed wounds should be kept dry, only irrigating with clean water or wine, and suppuration in the wound was a part of the healing process as it expelled spoiled blood [116]. This belief in “laudable pus” persisted from at least ancient Greece for more than a millennium. Galen (130–200 CE), author of hundreds of works describing surgical techniques such as trepanning of the skull and treatment of penetrating abdominal wounds, was probably the first to use the Latin term “pus bonum et laudabile” after observing that suppurating wounds were often the first to heal [41]. Although succeeding generations of surgeons who studied wound care had no reason to question the concept of laudable pus, there were a few dissidents, such as the Dominican friar Theodoric (1205–1296), who asserted, “It is not necessary that pus be formed in wounds” [113]. By the mid-19th century, the formation of pus was considered an inevitable consequence of surgery, but not part of the healing process. Surgery that healed without pus was described as “healing by first intention,” and surgeons distinguished between creamy white or yellow laudable pus with the bloody, watery, foul-smelling malignant pus that indicated pyemia often followed by death [15].
Because the physician held higher status than the surgeon during the Middle Ages, few treatises on surgery or wound care were published. One notable exception was Guy De Chauliac (1298–1368), who proposed five principles for treating wounds: removal of foreign bodies, rejoining of severed tissues, maintenance of tissue continuity, preservation of organ substance, and prevention of complications. De Chauliac described a weighted system for continuous traction to reduce femoral fractures. He also was an early advocate of topical anesthesia [79] and described techniques for hernia, cataract, and amputation [41].
The development of firearms made cautery a universally accepted treatment for gunshot wounds throughout the 16th century. Gunshot wounds resulted in gross tissue destruction that was an excellent medium for infection. However, because surgeons of the era had no knowledge of bacteria, they concluded infection was the result of poisonous gunpowder, and sought to destroy the poison by pouring boiling oil into the wound [116]. The precise origin of this practice is uncertain, but it was widely popularized through medical texts written by an Italian surgeon, Giovanni da Vigo (1460–1525) [41]. During the siege of Turin in 1536, Ambroise Paré (1510–1590), a surgeon with the French Army, ran out of boiling oil and substituted a salve of egg yolk, oil of rose, and turpentine, which, to his astonishment, reduced inflammation and enhanced patient comfort, at least compared with “seething oil” [7]. He concluded conventional wisdom was incorrect and published his observations in his Treatise on Gunshot Wounds in 1545.
During the American Revolutionary War, surgeons from the British and American sides emphasized conservative care. John Hunter (1728–1793), surgeon general of the British army, directed physicians to resist aggressive débridement in smaller wounds. Wine was applied topically to minor burns, and hog lard to full-thickness burns [96]. John Jones (1729–1791), a veteran of the French and Indian Wars (1754–1763) and Professor of Surgery in King’s College, New York, advised surgeons to delay primary wound closure and apply:
… nothing but dry, soft lint to recent wounds; which is generally the best application through the whole course of the cure. At first it restrain the hemorrhage with less injury than any styptic medicines; and afterwards, by absorbing the matter, which is at first thin and acrimonious, it becomes, in effect, the best digestive. During incarnation (granulation) it is the softest medicine than can be applied between the roller and tender granulations; and at the same time an easy compress on the sprouting fungus. For these reasons I shall not recommend to you any ointments for recent wounds, unless some mild, soft one, to arm a pledget of tow, to cover the lint. … Incised wounds are to be brought together with sticking plaster and bandages. The use of a suture is unnecessary in longitudinal wounds. Transverse wounds require the suture. The interrupted suture is used and the needle dipped in oil. A plaster is applied over the sutures, which may usually be removed in two or three days [40].
Bullets were removed only if within easy reach of the surgeon. If a wound had to be closed, a piece of onion was placed in the cavity before closure, and the wound reopened in 1 to 2 days. As in the past, Colonial physicians saw the development of pus a few days after injury as a sign of proper wound digestion [96].
By the time of the Crimean War, wound management had changed little in a conflict that saw the first use of the Minié ball in combat. These bullets traveled at a higher velocity and struck the body with greater force, shattering bone into small fragments and causing extensive soft tissue damage. The resulting compound fractures, as noted by Dr. George Macleod (1828–1892), a staff surgeon at a general hospital in Sebastopol, the Ukraine, forced British surgeons to learn hard lessons:
Of all the severe injuries recorded in battle, none are of more frequent occurrence or of more serious consequence than compound fractures. … In the Crimea, these injuries were peculiarly embarrassing and extraordinarily fatal. … It can hardly be doubted that the great striving after conservatism, which influenced all the surgeons of our army, was one main cause of that mortality which attended these injuries [90].
Hemorrhage was classified as primary, occurring within 24 hours of wounding; intermediate, occurring between the first and tenth days; and secondary, occurring after the tenth day. Macleod [90] believed a patient was vulnerable to hemorrhage until the wound had fully closed but was unlikely to have problems 24 days after wounding.
The devastating trauma caused by the Minié ball was seen on a much larger scale during the US Civil War. Fatality rates were high for penetrating gunshot wounds to the abdomen (87%) and chest (62%) [12]. Early in the war, cautery and tourniquets were the primary approach to controlling hemorrhage, but as physicians grew more experienced, ligature became the primary means for hemostasis. Primary hemorrhage became rarer, but intermediate hemorrhage, after 3 or 4 days, was more frequent and carried a mortality rate of 62% [13].
Although von Esmarch is rightly remembered for his improvements in organization and evacuation, his most famous innovation was the triangular Esmarch bandage (“Dreieckstück” or “triangular piece”), a piece of cotton twice as long at the base as along the sides, which can be folded in numerous ways to act as a dressing or sling [42]. von Esmarch also urged the use of ice packs to reduce inflammation in wounds, leading colleagues to give him the nickname “Fritz the Ice Pack” [42].
The Spanish-American War (1898) was notable for the introduction of smaller-caliber, high-velocity, metal-jacketed bullets, which were first used in the Battle of Santiago, Cuba, on July 1, 1898. The metal-jacket bullet was conceived as a more humane form of ammunition that would produce cleaner wounds and less deformation [51]. This was not the case, as a higher-velocity missile turned out to produce greater cavitation and extensive soft tissue damage beyond the path of the bullet [147].
The British orthopaedic surgeon, Robert Jones (1857–1933), applied lessons from his medical family and his civilian work to great effect during World War I. Jones’ uncle, Hugh Owen Thomas (1834–1891), first described the use of braces and splints in fracture management in his 1875 book Diseases of the Hip, Knee and Ankle Joints [55]. Robert Jones began practicing medicine in 1878 and a decade later became surgeon for the massive, 7-year Manchester Ship Canal Project, which involved 20,000 workers and provided numerous opportunities to practice new techniques in fracture care. By the time World War I began, Jones had narrowed his practice from general surgery to orthopaedics and became director general for orthopaedics for the British military. At this point, the death rate from battlefield fractures of the femur was approximately 80%. In response, Jones reintroduced his uncle’s splint to immobilize the leg immediately on the battlefield. Medics and stretcher bearers were blindfolded during training sessions so that they would be ready to apply the splint in total darkness. By 1915, better immediate management of femur fractures had reduced the mortality rate to approximately 20% [55].
In 1945, the Office of the Surgeon General summarized the general approach to wound care during the Second World War:
As the initial wound operation is by definition a limited procedure, nearly every case requires further treatment. Soft part wounds, purposely left unsutured at the initial operation, are closed by suture, usually at the time of the first dressing on or after the fourth day. Fractures are accurately reduced and immobilized until bony union takes place. Designed to prevent or cut short wound infection either before it is established or at the time of its inception, this phase in the surgical care of the wounded is concerned with shortening the period of wound-healing and seeks as its objectives the early restoration of function and the return of a soldier to duty with a minimum number of days lost [102].
The major change in the evaluation of wounds during World War II involved the timing of closure. In World War I, surgeons learned the value of delayed primary closure in aiding recovery and fighting infection. Cultures would be the main determinant of whether a wound was ready for closure. However, physicians found judging the clinical appearance of the wound—whether tissues looked healthy, with absence of drainage, foreign material, and edema—led to better results. Edward D. Churchill (1895–1972), a US surgeon in the Mediterranean and North African theaters, reported in 1944 that 25,000 soft tissue wounds from battle in North Italy had been closed based solely on appearance, with only a 5% failure rate [28]. Cleveland and Grove [32], in a series of 2293 closures over compound fractures in patients evacuated to Britain, found 93% of wounds healed successfully when judged in this fashion instead of relying solely on cultures.
In Korea, combat medics worked effectively to resuscitate wounded before they were transported by helicopter and truck. Pressure dressings were applied as a first resort to control bleeding; guidelines stated tourniquets should be used only if pressure dressings were not sufficient. Fractures were splinted and wounded extremities immobilized. The medic may have begun antibiotic therapy if the casualty could not be transported for 4 to 5 hours. Blood was transfused before evacuation [128]. Extremity wounds were débrided and left open and fixed with Küntscher wires and plaster [5].
During the Vietnam War, semiautomatic rifles with high-velocity rounds caused considerable soft tissue damage, complicating wound care. Patients frequently sustained multiple wounds from bursts of automatic fire or booby traps. Surgeons could receive patients as early as 1 to 2 hours after wounding [60, 96], although in reality conditions during combat often delayed evacuation and resulted in an arrival time of 4 to 6 hours after wounding. On arrival, the patient was infused with Ringer’s lactate and antibiotics. The wound was débrided and lavaged and packed open with occlusive dressings. Patients with fractures and vascular injuries typically were treated by vascular and orthopaedic specialists. Fractures were treated by reduction and initial traction or casting depending on the severity of the wounds. Secondary closure of the wound usually could be accomplished in 7 days. Wounds with massive soft tissue damage were covered with occlusive dressings or a mesh graft. Innovations included increasingly sophisticated vascular repair and treatment of hypovolemic shock [115].
The nature of wounds sustained by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan has been transformed by suicide bombers, and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) have contributed to limb amputations as a result of massive tissue damage from explosives. In Iraq and Afghanistan, resuscitation begins on the battlefield (Level I) and continues during transport. Tourniquets and advanced hemostatic dressings, such as HemCon® (HemCon Medical Technologies, Inc, Portland, OR) and QuikClot™ (Z-Medica, Newington, CT), also are used in the field. Depending on battle conditions, the wounded may reach a Level II or Level III facility in 30 to 90 minutes [126]. Care at Level II facilities is limited to damage control, such as the placement of vascular shunts and stabilization, whereas Level III facilities can provide definitive repair of arterial and venous injuries using autologous vein, with a goal of definite repair of vascular injury before evacuation from Iraq [119]. Once at the Level IV or V facilities, wounds are evaluated and definitive fixation of injuries occurs. When limbs can be saved, internal and external fixation methods are incorporated. Fracture patterns and the extent of the soft tissue injuries dictate fixation type. External fixation is used when an extended amount of time is needed for repeated débridement. A combination of internal and external fixators is used with injuries to upper extremities. Tibia fractures frequently require external fixation, whereas femur fractures generally are treated with intramedullary rods. In the case of lower extremity periarticular fractures, a combination of internal and external fixation often is useful. Free flaps and rotational flaps are used to provide soft tissue coverage, along with the relatively new innovation of secondary-intention wound granulation through vacuum-assisted closure dressings and hemostatic bandages [3].

Surgical Techniques and Technology
Amputation has been performed since ancient times, as observed by Peruvian votive figures and Egyptian mummies. Hippocrates advocated amputation of gangrenous limbs, although he advised removing them through, not above, the gangrenous area [84]. The Roman Celsus (circa 3–64 CE) later observed the border between healthy and sick tissue was the proper demarcation line [84]. Before the invention of gunpowder in the 14th century, wounds were caused by cutting, stabbing, and blunt force, and the injured often lived without major surgical intervention. As musculoskeletal injuries from shot and cannon grew more complex, surgeons gained greater experience with the art of amputation.
As noted above, the French surgeon Paré found “seething oil” need not be used in cauterizing wounds. More important was his observation that bleeding after amputation could be stopped by ligating blood vessels instead of applying red-hot irons. He developed a procedure for tying off veins and arteries that made thigh amputations possible. He published his technique in 1564, imploring surgeons to abandon entirely “the old and cruel way of healing” with cautery [7]. Using Paré’s methods, limb amputation remained the most common treatment for extremity wounds, as it transformed a complex wound into a simple wound with a better chance of recovery. Throughout his long career, Paré served in at least 17 military campaigns and was personal surgeon to four kings of France. During the Battle of Metz, the besieged French soldiers allegedly exclaimed, “We shall not die even though we are wounded. Paré is with us” [53]. His conservative methods revolutionized care and likely spared thousands from suffering [73].
The normal practice through the 16th and 17th centuries was the single circular cut. Through the 18th century, the treatment of wounds had advanced little since Paré, until two innovations by Jean Petit (1674–1750). Petit introduced the two-stage circular cut, in which the skin was transected distal to the planned level of amputation and pulled up. The muscles and bone then were cut at the same level proximally. This technique was adopted and refined by English, Austrian, and Prussian surgeons [92, 125]. Petit’s second contribution was the modified tourniquet, with a screw to adjust tension, making bleeding during an amputation manageable (Fig. 6) [60]. During the late 17th century, English and German surgeons also began to experiment with soft tissue flaps to cover the bone, a technique used routinely by England’s Robert Liston (1794–1847) by 1837 [91].

One of the ongoing controversies regarding amputation throughout history was timing the procedure. Britain’s John Hunter, in line with his conservative approach, advised against amputation on 18th century battlefields, believing more time was needed for inflammation (what we now know as septic contamination) to ease before surgery [67]. In contrast, France’s Larrey urged immediate intervention. He ordered primary amputation within 24 hours for all ballistic wounds with injuries to major vessels, major damage to soft tissue, and comminuted bones. He also performed complete débridement to provide the best possible stump and advised leaving the stump end open, covered only with a light bandage [84]. Although largely known for his organizational skills, Larrey was one of the most accomplished surgeons of his time and certainly must have been among the fastest, as he is credited with performing 200 amputations in a 24-hour period during the Battle of Borodino (1812) [61]. He also performed the first successful disarticulation of the hip [84].
The Crimean War was the first major conflict in which chloroform was widely used as an anesthetic [33]. Although ether had been used on a limited scale by the US Army in the Mexican-American War [1, 72] (1846–1848) and by the Imperial Russian Army during a pacification campaign in the Caucasus region [95], the inherent flammability made its utility questionable in a battlefield hospital. News of anesthesia’s successful application in battlefield surgery profoundly influenced its increasing acceptance in civilian settings [95]. An additional innovation was the use of plaster of Paris as a support for broken bones [140].
During the US Civil War, amputation was the most common surgical procedure for the 60,266 Union patients who sustained gunshot fractures [123]. Mortality for amputation of the lower limbs overall was 33%, and above the knee it increased to 54% [123]. Although surgeons of the era were aware of flap techniques and some Union surgeons used them [84], circular amputations were preferred for better control of hemorrhage [56] and were performed at the level of injury to preserve length. At the beginning of the war, Samuel Gross (1805–1884), Professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College, noted amputation was more likely to be successful if performed as soon after injury as possible, at least 12 to 24 hours after injury [104]. Wartime experience proved this observation as the fatality rate of patients with 16,238 amputations of upper and lower extremities by primary amputation (within 48 hours of wounding) was 23.9% compared with a 34.8% mortality rate among patients with 5501 intermediate amputations (between 2 days to a month) and 28.8% for patients with secondary amputations (after a month) [104]. He cautioned against procrastination, urging surgeons to decide on the course of treatment using the best information available [104]. Before the war, few American surgeons would have attempted to operate on major blood vessels, but by the war’s end, thousands of physicians were experienced in tying an artery [124]. Surgeons made early attempts at open reductions or excisions, albeit with a 27% fatality rate, despite the fact that the majority of cases were performed on upper extremities. Sixty-six complex hip disarticulations were performed, with an 88% mortality rate for primary amputations, 100% for intermediate amputations, and 55.5% for secondary amputations (Fig. 7) [104]. Anesthesia was used extensively. Surgeons used chloroform in approximately 75% of cases in which anesthesia was used; ether or a mixture of ether and chloroform was used in other cases.

Military surgeons were quick to adopt the use of radiographs after Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen’s (1845–1923) discovery of xrays in 1895 [81]. Only 5 months later, Italian physicians in Naples used radiographs to locate bullets in soldiers wounded during their country’s invasion of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) [30]. During the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 (also known as the Thirty Days’ War), German (on the Ottoman side) and British (on the Greek side) physicians used the new technology [30]. Less than 3 years later, during the Spanish-American War, the US Army placed xray machines onboard three hospital ships in the theater of operations [10]. Surgeons no longer were compelled to locate bullets by probing, improving antiseptic practice, and radiographs revealed the nature of fractures in detail previously unimaginable [43]. Despite the radiograph’s revolutionary role, and its rapid incorporation into US military medicine during the war, the teaching and practice of radiology among military physicians languished until 1917, when the leadership of the American Roentgen Ray Society successfully petitioned the War Department to create 10 centers for physician and technician training [30].
As Paul Dougherty noted, the American Expeditionary Force’s relatively late involvement in World War I led to reliance on the experience of the British and French physicians on the Allied side [37]. During the war, a Belgian surgeon, Antoine Depage (1862–1925), realized the current approach of minimal wound exploration and primary closure was insufficient. He believed dead tissue led to infection and must be removed, and infection decreased if the wound were left open to air for a time. Antiseptics were an essential part of wound care but could not replace thorough débridement and removal of foreign material [66]. After poor results from primary closure early in the conflict, Allied surgeons began using the open circular technique with better results and flaps constructed to ease closure. Most frequently, wounds were left open for 24 to 48 hours and then closed if bacterial counts were low and the wound’s appearance indicated it was not infected. If higher bacteria counts were detected, the wound was reopened and irrigated with Dakin’s solution (see below). Delayed closure also allowed surgeons to experiment with other surgical techniques, such as leaving bone fragments in place in patients with compound long-bone fractures. A half century of improved surgical and antiseptic techniques meant, from the time of the Civil War to World War I, the rate of major amputations as a percent of all battle injuries had decreased from 12% to just 1.7% [114]. Postoperative care also was improved, as seven amputee centers were established across the country to provide specialized surgery, therapy, and prosthetics [37].
US entry into the conflict required the mobilization of thousands of surgeons who had limited experience with wartime amputation. A review of amputations of casualties at Pearl Harbor showed infections from early primary closure of the stump, open amputations performed at a higher level than necessary, and failure to provide skin traction [109]. In 1943, Kirk, a veteran of World War I and expert on amputations, became the first orthopaedic surgeon to serve as surgeon general. Kirk’s published recommendations before his appointment were essentially the same as Army guidelines, emphasizing the open circular technique, where skin and soft tissues are left slightly longer than the bone, and double ligation of blood vessels and delayed plastic closure [85]. Amputation was to be performed at the lowest level of viable soft tissue to preserve length for further revision surgery. If the patient was not to be moved, flaps could be constructed to allow for closure later. Skin traction was required after surgery through evacuation. There were some variations from theater to theater with time regarding whether sulfa powder would be applied to wounds, and the practice was abandoned by D-Day (see below) [37]. US military guidelines changed as circumstances warranted. For example, before the invasion at Normandy in June 1944, surgeons destined for the European theater were instructed they would be allowed to use either the open circular method or the true guillotine (in which fat, muscle, and bone were divided at the same level). Just a month after the landing, based on real-time experiences, only the former technique was recommended. Likewise, earlier in the war, Vaseline gauze was used to dress the wound; by 1944, fine-mesh gauze was mandated to allow for better drainage [37]. As during World War I, the Army and Navy established specialized centers in the United States to provide for amputee’s postmilitary rehabilitation (The centers have continued through today in the Armed Forces Amputee Patient Care Program, with facilities in Washington, DC; San Antonio, TX; and San Diego, CA.) [114].
Fracture care also evolved during World War II. Early methods of external fixation, using pins and plaster rather than the complex devices seen today [4], had become more widespread in civilian settings in the 1930s and initially were used by the US Army and Navy overseas. However, many military physicians were still inexperienced in the management of fractures by external fixation, and of the 25 patients treated with external fixation in the Mediterranean theater, four had infections develop, and a fifth experienced “bowing and slough at the pin site” [38]. Discouraged by early results, the US Army under Kirk’s leadership did not use external fixation for most of the war, even as Navy physicians reported good results [129]. Through the conflicts in Vietnam and Korea, the US Army prohibited the use of external fixation, even in the treatment of massive soft tissue wounds. Instead, from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, functional casting was the official technique for managing long-bone fractures [127]. The US Army’s objections to external fixation meant that a generation of orthopaedic surgeons had no opportunity to learn the practice in wartime. A 1950 survey by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons showed that only 28% of respondents believed external fixation had a role in fracture management [130].
A major innovation in the treatment of fractures came from a German surgeon, Gerhard Küntscher (1900–1972), who in the late 1930s developed the practice of intramedullary nailing for long-bone fractures. The onset of war in 1939 prevented the dissemination of Küntscher’s techniques to Western Europe or the United States, but American surgeons became aware of his work from captured Allied airmen treated by intramedullary nailing during captivity. The procedure was controversial among US surgeons and was not used until the Korean War [39]. Brav and Jeffress [16] reported good results from intramedullary nailing on eight patients with femoral fractures from gunshot wounds but recommended it be reserved for patients who did not respond to traditional traction and suspension. Intramedullary nailing gained gradual (sometimes grudging) acceptance in civilian practice through the 1960s and 1970s [26], and in the 1990s was the subject of renewed interest with improvements in implants and technique [142].
One of the most notable contributions of Surgeon General Kirk’s leadership was the recruitment of his long-time colleague, A. Sterling Bunnell, MD (1882–1957) (Fig. 8), to create the US Army Hand Centers in late 1944. While touring stateside hospitals, Kirk had become alarmed by the lack of efforts to salvage crippled hands. Posttrauma care of hand wounds was provided routinely by various specialists: orthopaedists, plastic surgeons, and neurosurgeons. Bunnell, who had just finished the first edition of his huge work, Surgery of the Hand [20], seized the opportunity to create the specialty of hand surgery [25]. At the 10 hand centers he directed, young physicians, many of them just out of surgical training, developed most of the techniques still used today: tendon transfer, nerve repair, skin grafts, arthrodesis, and osteotomy [18, 21, 25]. One of those physicians, Paul Brown, pioneered the use of Kirschner wires to provide fixation for closed and open complex hand injuries; his techniques are still used today [19].

Vascular surgery, an experimental procedure during World War II, became routine in Korea as Edward J. Jahnke (born 1923) trained surgeons to use the procedure, reducing the amputation rate attributable to vascular injury from 49.6% during World War II to 20.5% during the Korean War [139].
As the care of the wounded became routine, surgeons began to devote their attention to cases that would have resulted in certain death in previous wars. A Renal Insufficiency Center, complete with a Kolff-Brigham Artificial Kidney, treated 51 patients at the 11th Evacuation Hospital in Korea [73]. Improved resuscitation and transport meant 0.5% of patients suffering from shock who would have died lived long enough to suffer acute renal failure because of fluid volume overload and/or myocardial potassium intoxication [87]. The mortality rate among these patients was reportedly as high as 90% [135]. When dialysis was introduced in 1951, the mortality rate later decreased to 53% [27]. Studies between the Korean and Vietnam conflicts showing the importance of fluid balance during shock informed changes in practice that led to a reduced incidence of renal failure (0.17%) in Vietnam casualties [23, 35]. Generally, dialysis was effective for patients with major musculoskeletal injuries who otherwise were healthy; acute renal failure occurred mostly in patients who had multiple complications after wounding [143].
In both World Wars and Korea, artillery was the deadliest threat to soldiers. In Vietnam, because the enemy had relatively little heavy weaponry, most injuries were caused by machine gun fire, mines, and booby traps. As a consequence, the rate of major amputations as a percentage of all battle injuries actually increased to 3.4% from 1.4% in Korea and 1.2% in World War I [114]. Blast injuries, often from beneath the injured soldier, caused deep penetration of foreign material into the thigh and often hips and knees. After battlefield evacuation, usually by helicopter, surgeons evaluated the wound, and the decision to amputate was made by an orthopaedic specialist. The open-flap amputation was the preferred procedure, with delayed closure, although the circular method also was allowed. Amputation was performed at the most distal point, with all nonviable tissue débrided [8]. Although experience from previous wars and official recommendations called for continuous skin traction, a 1970 study of 300 amputees indicated only 44% had been treated with some form of skin traction [145]. Pins and plaster were applied before evacuation to a stateside hospital.
Colonel Norman Rich (born 1934), chief of surgery in a MASH unit in Vietnam’s central highlands, pioneered venous repair for military trauma, increasing the chance of saving badly wounded legs [121, 122]. On his return to the United States, he established the Vietnam Vascular Registry, which has records from more than 7500 cases and still is used today [117, 147].
In today’s military, enhanced body armor and modern resuscitation have increased survival rates for patients with blast wounds that previously would have been fatal. This positive development poses a challenge for surgeons treating the wounded from Afghanistan and Iraq, particularly in the realm of limb salvage. Owens et al. [107] studied 1281 wounded from 2001 to 2005. The soldiers sustained 3575 extremity combat wounds, with 53% penetrating soft tissue wounds and 26% (915) fractures. Open fractures comprised 82%, or 758, and were evenly distributed between the lower and upper extremities. Three-quarters of the injuries were caused by explosive devices [107].
The care of patients who have sustained IED wounds is complex; trauma, burns, blood loss, devitalized tissue, and embedded fragments of the explosive along with rocks, dirt, glass, and debris can be present. Damage control resuscitation performed by military surgeons recognizes a successful outcome depends on more than merely treating the wound. Blood chemistry needs to be stabilized, hypothermia must be prevented, and systolic blood pressure maintained at 90 mm/Hg, in addition to controlling bleeding, removing foreign bodies, débridement, and fracture fixation [100].
Current guidelines no longer call for circular amputation but (as in the past) emphasize the need to preserve maximum length for later preservation. The patient undergoes thorough surgical débridement within 2 hours of injury and redébridement every 48 to 72 hours through evacuation. No viable tissues are removed, and the level of soft tissue injury (not the fracture) determines the amputation level. Wounds are left open through transport; no skin traction is used because of the relatively short evacuation time, although negative pressure dressings have been used at sites along evacuation routes to the continental United States [64]. Once stateside, the patient is evaluated, and débridement is continued until the wound is ready for delayed closure. A now greatly expanded rehabilitation program, with the aid of prosthetic devices using digital technology, assists amputees in their return to civilian life or, in at least 30 cases so far, to active duty [47, 64].

Blood Transfusion
The Austrian Karl Landsteiner (1868–1943) and coworkers described blood types A, B, and O in 1901, and the AB blood group in 1902 [149]. Subsequent blood typing greatly reduced the potential complications of blood transfusion. Expanded transfusion offered the promise of preventing many fatalities of war caused by or complicated by blood loss. It also posed medical and logistic challenges to military caregivers.
The British Army began routine use of blood transfusion for treatment of combat casualties. In 1916, surgeons performed direct transfusions on patients whose conditions were considered desperate. Of the 19 casualties it was tried on, 15 died. Despite the inauspicious start, surgeons with the British Second Army routinely performed direct transfusions on patients using a syringe cannula technique. In November 1917, American surgeon Captain Oswald Robertson (1886–1966) concluded it would be better to stockpile blood before the arrival of casualties. He collected 500 mL of blood from each donor and stored it in an icebox to be administered to a patient 10 to 14 days later. Blood could be stored and transported to be administered at casualty clearing stations close to the front, creating the first blood bank [82].
Despite the lessons of World War I, many surgeons still believed shock was caused by inadequate arterial pressure rather than inadequate capillary perfusion. Although the British had entered the war with large quantities of blood and plasma and Charles Drew (1904–1950) of the American Red Cross had developed an international blood collection and distribution system for the Blood for Britain campaign of 1940 [50], the US Army had no blood banks, and when blood was given, it was only in small amounts (100–150 mL) [59]. After heavy losses in North Africa, military surgeons recommended a blood bank be instituted. However, the Surgeon General’s office balked, citing logistic concerns and stating plasma was adequate [59]. Under the leadership of US Surgeon General Kirk, an organized system to provide whole blood transfusions instead was developed by army field hospitals in 1943 and 1944. By the second half of 1944, with huge numbers of soldiers in the field across Europe and in the Pacific, army policy finally changed to provide air shipments of whole blood from the United States. By March 1945, the army was shipping 2000 units a day (Figs. 9,
10) [68]. The system was implemented rapidly, was highly efficient, and doubtless saved thousands of lives but was completely dismantled by the onset of the Korean War.

At the outbreak of fighting in Korea, with the US military in rapid retreat, collections stateside were shipped to the 406th General Medical Laboratory in Tokyo. Type O was greatly preferred to eliminate the need for crossmatching, specialized technicians, and larger stocks. According to the Armed Services Blood Program (ASBP) records, only four major hemolytic reactions resulting in acute renal failure were reported of approximately 50,000 transfusions in 1952. All four were attributable to locally acquired blood. The most lasting legacy of the Korean War regarding blood transfusion may be the introduction of plastic bags rather than glass bottles, better enabling preparation of components and, by eliminating breakage, ensuring more units reached troops. The Military Blood Program (today’s ASBP) was established in 1953 [2].
US military blood programs reflected the experience in Korea during the early years of engagement in Vietnam. Approximately every 10 days, units of Type O blood were shipped from Japan [83]. As the American military commitment grew by April 1965, the Army established a central blood bank in Saigon, with four subdepots across the country, and greatly broadened the collection of blood to reduce shortages. Every unit used to support the war was donated voluntarily by military personnel, dependents of military personnel, and civilians working on military bases—approximately 1.5 million donors and 1.8 million units of blood. For the first time, forward medical units received all four types of blood. The ASBP coordinated collection stateside, and blood was processed at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey before shipping to Vietnam. Blood also was collected from volunteers representing all services in Okinawa, Japan, and Korea and distributed by the 406th Mobile Medical Laboratory in Saigon [14].
After Vietnam, the US military maintained its capacity to collect, package, and transport blood. Improvements in anticoagulants and technology to freeze blood greatly enhanced its efforts. During the 1991 Gulf War, the ASPB shipped more than 100,000 units to troops in theater and currently operates 21 donor centers and 81 transfusion centers in the United States, Europe, and Asia [2].

Infection and Antibiotics
In the 18th century, infection control was not considered an issue, because physicians assumed disease was caused by an imbalance of humors rather than microbes. However, surgeon Charles Gillman, after accidentally spilling rum on the badly infected hand of a soldier wounded in the Battle of Harlem (1776), noted the infection resolved rapidly, an observation consistent with Hippocrates’ recommendation to use wine to irrigate a wound [116]. Yet, the practice was never adopted by the Continental surgeons.
Gunshot wounds continued to be treated as inherently infected by gunpowder until Hunter published his Treatise on Blood, Inflammation, and Gunshot Wounds [75] in 1794. He argued a bullet wound should be treated like any other wound [54], although he cautioned against wound exploration, débridement, and splinting. Physicians throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries continued to experiment with various compounds to prevent the spread of infection in patients with compound fractures, including wood tar, chlorine, tincture of benzoin, silver nitrate, and various alcohol solutions [116].
The Civil War famously showed the value of sanitary practices, or the consequences of their absence. Contrary to popular belief, surgeons usually washed, but did not disinfect, their hands and surgical instruments. The surgeon typically operated bare-handed, wearing his regular uniform or civilian garb protected by a butcher’s apron. Surgery generally was performed outdoors to take advantage of sunlight. The aseptic environment of 21st century hospitals was not even a concept during the Civil War [15]. Suppuration still was regarded as a sign of proper healing rather than a risk for pyemia [12, 13]. Even so, death was more likely to come from a camp-acquired disease than from a battlefield wound. Of the generally accepted number of approximately 620,000 deaths among Union and Confederate forces, about two thirds resulted from disease, most prominently dysentery and typhoid [104].
The most feared wound infections were erysipelas, presumably attributable to Streptococcus pyogenes, and hospital gangrene. Physicians did not agree on the cause or treatment for erysipelas, which carried a mortality rate of 8%. The battle against hospital gangrene and its 60% mortality rate [96], however, produced one of the rare antiinfection victories of the war. In 1863, the Union medical officer Middleton Goldsmith (1818–1887), stationed in Louisville, KY, reported the results of a treatment protocol that called for débridement of all necrotic tissue and application of a mixture of bromine, bromide of potassium, and water applied to dressings. Of his 308 patients treated in this fashion, only eight (2.6%) died [49]. Bromine was used widely thereafter to treat gas gangrene, although surgeons were never sure if it was effective [104, 116]. Carbolic acid and sodium hypochlorite also were used to treat established gangrene, but not as prophylaxis [96].
The Spanish-American War was the first major American military encounter since the introduction of Lister’s antiseptic technique (1867) and the acceptance of the germ theory of disease, as observed by Robert Koch (1843–1910) in 1882. Mortality rates decreased with the use of antiseptic dressings in the field and antiseptic/aseptic surgical techniques in hospitals, although sterile technique had not developed to the point that gloves and masks were used [34, 36]. Surgeons began to associate wound shock with sepsis and administered a saline solution subcutaneously or rectally to hydrate their patients [59]. These innovations almost halved the mortality rates (compared with the Civil War) to 7.4% of the 1320 patients treated for gunshot wounds, with only 29 cases treated by amputation [22].
Trench warfare during the First World War had several consequences. Soldiers were entrenched in farm fields fertilized with manure, which was rich with anaerobic organisms to infect wounds. Static warfare allowed for fixed lines of communication, which with motorized ambulances reduced evacuation time [47]. Machine guns and high-explosive shells caused massive wounds and extensive soft tissue damage. The practice of débridement and delayed primary closure was adopted by US surgeons during the war and all but eliminated the need for amputation as a prophylaxis against infection. It also allowed surgeons to experiment with other surgical techniques, such as leaving bone fragments in place in patients with compound long-bone fractures [31].
In December 1915, French surgeon Alexis Carrel (1873–1944) and English chemist Henry Dakin (1880–1952) perfected a technique of irrigating wounds with antiseptic Dakin’s solution (diluted sodium hypochlorite and boric acid) administered through perforated rubber tubing (Figs. 11,
12). Only after the wound had been disinfected thoroughly was closure attempted. Carrel and Dehelly described the successful treatment of various wounds—fresh, phlegmonous, gangrenous, and suppurating—all of which were disinfected and closed within 20 days [24]. Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) noted an initial benefit to the use of topical solutions, such as carbolic acid, perchloride/biniodide of mercury, boric acid, and hydrogen peroxide, but concluded antiseptics had a longer-term negative effect on healing and advised the surgeon to rely “on his skill alone” [44]. Although Dakin’s solution fell into disfavor after the war, some contemporary surgeons have called for a reevaluation of its potential usefulness [93].

Fleming also contributed an early description of the bacteriology of combat wounds. He noted the initial watery, odiferous, red-brown drainage and the presence of anaerobes and streptococci. A week later, in a second phase, the drainage was less bloody and foul-smelling, growing in purulence. Approximately 3 weeks after wounding, in the third phase, streptococci and staphylococci proliferated, as indicated by blood cultures [43].
The equine tetanus antitoxin had been discovered in 1890 and was first distributed on a large scale by British physicians during late 1914. Cases of tetanus decreased from nine per 1000 wounded in September 1914 to 1.4 per 1000 wounded by December 1914 [46]. By the end of World War II, the toxin and its administration were improved to a point that of more than 2.7 million hospital admissions for patients with wounds, only a dozen cases of tetanus were reported [88].
Dissatisfaction with the cumbersome Carrel-Dakin treatment led to its abandonment. During the Spanish Civil War, Josep Trueta (1897–1977) used a closed plaster method to treat 1073 patients with open fractures, with only six deaths and four subsequent amputations. The wounded area was cleaned thoroughly and débrided. The open wound was wrapped in gauze; the fracture was reduced and then immobilized with plaster [137, 138]. More than 20,000 patients were treated with this method during the war [10].
In a previous review of military medicine, RM Hardaway, who treated many of the wounded after Pearl Harbor, met with a team sent by the Army Surgeon General after the attack:
They were amazed at the uniformly well-healed wounds and asked how we treated them. We explained that we did a careful débridement, irrigated the wounds, sprinkled in a little sulfa power (which we had in salt shakers); left the wounds open and performed a delayed primary closure after three days. The immediate reaction was “that sulfanilamide powder is wonderful,” missing the point that the débridement and delayed primary closure were the main reason for the clean, uninfected, healed wounds [58].
The Surgeon General recommended sulfa powder be included in all first-aid packets, but instead of being sprinkled, it often was dumped in a lump and thus was ineffective, particularly in wounds that had not been cleaned properly and débrided [58]. By 1944, sulfa powder no longer was issued to soldiers or medics.
Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, but it was not until 1939 that an Oxford pathologist, Howard Florey (1898–1968), and his team showed its usefulness in vivo. Penicillin was not used successfully for treatment of a patient until March 1942 [17]. In November 1942, it was first administered to US troops wounded during an assault in Oran, Africa [96]. By then, with British manufacturing dedicated to the production of munitions, development of penicillin for mass production was focused in Peoria, IL, by the US Department of Agriculture, and then later with the US pharmaceutical giants Merck, Squibb, Pfizer, and Abbott. British and American production grew from 21 billion units in 1943 to 6.8 trillion units in 1945 [17]. The first large-scale military use was during the D-Day invasion of Normandy in June 1944. Although penicillin proved effective against Clostridium bacteria, which are responsible for tetanus and gas gangrene, it was considered a safeguard against infection while the surgeons débrided damaged soft tissue. Surgeons usually performed the secondary closure of the wound within 7 days after débridement [57].
In the Korean War, penicillin, usually in combination with streptomycin, remained the most common antibacterial agent used by US military caregivers. The decrease in time from wounding to surgical care thanks to rapid evacuation and MASH units was linked to an impressive reduction in the occurrence of gas gangrene; one study of 4900 wounds revealed a 0.08 incidence of gas gangrene and no mortality attributable to it [74]. Antibiotics were commonly used prophylactically, but at a risk that only became evident in retrospect, as increasingly resistant bacteria were reported from infected war wounds 3 to 5 days after injury [86, 141]. Physicians made a greater effort to identify bacteria and evaluate outcomes of antibiotic strategies. Studies of US wounded showed inadequate débridement to have been the most common cause of infection and prophylactic use of antibiotics was linked to the development of drug-resistant bacteria [141]. A 1951–1952 evaluation of neurosurgical patients in the Tokyo Army Hospital revealed, of 58 isolates from infected wounds, 48 were resistant to penicillin, 49 were resistant to streptomycin, and seven were multidrug resistant [141].
Wound infection data from Vietnam may be misleading. Hardaway, in his classic study of 17,726 patients from 1966 to 1967, found a postoperative infection rate of 3.9%; however, as he noted, the study only included patients managed in Vietnam and not patients whose infections developed or became apparent later after evacuation [60]. The punji stick, a piece of sharpened bamboo placed in the ground, created lower extremity wounds with a 10% infection rate, but few fatalities. Seventy percent of the wounded received antibiotics, usually penicillin and streptomycin, and usually intravenously. Eighty percent of wounds underwent débridement. Again, physicians increasingly found patterns of antibiotic resistance. The 1972 study of Tong [136] of 30 Marines injured in combat tracked bacterial flora in wound cultures at injury, after 3 days, and after 5 days, with blood cultures obtained every 8 hours. A mix of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria most often were found initially, but the pathogens found in Day 5 cultures were mostly gram-negative, most predominantly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All bacteria from blood cultures were resistant to penicillin and streptomycin [136]. The 1968 study of Kovaric et al. [86] of 112 cultures identified resistant strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.
During the US engagement in Vietnam, military physicians pioneered the use of pulsatile lavage to reduce bacterial and other contamination and to remove necrotic tissue from crush wounds [80]. Oral surgeons were first to use a modified Teledyne WaterPik® (Teledyne Technologies, Inc, West Los Angeles, CA) to decontaminate facial wounds; orthopaedic surgeons then adapted the instrument and technique to irrigate and débride extremity wounds [52]. Also during the war, a considerable amount of research focused on topical antiseptics for treatment of open wounds and burns. In 1962, a combination of Sulfamylon® (mafenide acetate; UDL Laboratories, Inc, Rockford, IL) and penicillin was used in an animal study to treat massive wounds infected with Clostridium perfringens [94]. The acidosis associated with absorption of the drug led to its later emergence as an ointment (Silvadene®; silver sulfadiazine; Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc, Bridgewater, NJ), a useful antibacterial agent for burn wound treatment. However, topical antibiotics remain controversial and have yet to become a standard of care in military or civilian medicine. Murray et al. [96] reported only approximately 2% of the wounded in Vietnam were treated with topic antibiotics.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, broad-spectrum antibiotics generally are not administered during early treatment. Antibiotic therapy is directed by cultures taken on admission to US military hospitals. In addition to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, other resistant strains of pathogens have been found in US war wounds [97, 148]. One survey of infections from Combat Support Hospitals in Iraq during 2003 to 2004 showed bacteria most commonly isolated from clinical infections in US troops were coagulase-negative staphylococci, accounting for 34% of isolates, Staphylococcus aureus (26%), and streptococcal species (11%). The 732 cultures obtained from the predominantly Iraqi population included mostly gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae (13%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (11%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were resistant to a broad array of antimicrobial agents [148].

Discussion
It is reasonable in many ways to view the history of military trauma care as a story of constant progress over the long term. Mortality from all wounds decreased dramatically across the 20th century, from 8.5% among US troops in World War I [36], to 3.3% in World War II [118], to 2.4% in Korea [120], and leveling at 2.6% in Vietnam [58]. Improvements in surgical management stopped the scourge of Clostridium-associated gas gangrene, which had a 5% incidence and 28% mortality among US troops in World War I but had fundamentally disappeared by the Korean War [65]. Likewise, the mortality of patients with abdominal wounds declined from 21% in World War II to 12% in Korea and 4.5% in Vietnam [60]. Although the historical trend is reasonably clear, mortality rates can be deceiving, depending, for example, on how those wounded who quickly returned to action were accounted for statistically and aspects that cannot be quantified easily and that have nothing to do with medical advances. Holcomb et al. [69] calculated the death rate from wounds among US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan as 4.8%, an increase from World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. However, the percentage of those killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan has actually been lower, 13.8% compared with 20% in Vietnam and World War II [69]. This is likely the result of numerous factors, including improved body armor, tactics, the very nature of the mission undertaken by troops, improved front line medical attention, and prompt evacuation. The speed of evacuation increased dramatically from the horse carts of the 19th century and even the motorized transport of World War I; in World War II, the average time from injury to hospitalization was 12 to 15 hours, but by Vietnam it generally was less than 2 hours. As noted, wounded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan can be transported to a combat support hospital in 30 to 90 minutes.
Still, the path toward today’s standard of care was not smooth. Misconceptions regarding wound healing persisted in military and civilian medicine until the age of Lister and Pasteur, and the failure to understand wound shock and substitute unsubstantiated theories in place of knowledge resulted in higher mortality rates in both world wars. Worse yet, the lessons regarding shock and delayed primary closure, learned at great human expense in World War I, had to be relearned by Americans in World War II. Also, for most of the history of warfare, at least until World War II, disease usually killed at a higher ratio than battle wounds: nearly 8:1 in the Napoleonic Wars, 4:1 in the Crimean War, 2:1 in the Civil War, 7:1 in the Spanish-American War, and 4:1 in World War I [29, 132]. In World War II, the ratio decreased to 0.1:1; in Korea and Vietnam, to 0.2:1; and in the 1992 Gulf War, to 0.1:1 [132].
The lessons of the history of military emergency medicine are on display in the current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The military has a strategy for care, from the training received by an individual soldier, to his squadron’s medic, to the provision of a forward medical corps, to immediate transport for emergency surgery, to eventual transport for definitive care and recovery. It is undoubtedly the best-trained, best-equipped, and fastest system of military trauma care in history. However, today’s caregivers in the US Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines also face challenges peculiar to their time and place.
Of crucial importance is the problem of wound infection. As survivorship has increased, even among patients with devastating extremity wounds that would have been fatal in the past, multidrug-resistant pathogens are complicating recovery [78]. A major concern is that past ill-advised use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for empirical treatment of combat wounds is resulting in selection of more resistant pathogens. Additional study in military and civilian settings is needed to refine protocols for antibiotic prophylaxis on the battlefield. Another ongoing challenge is the need to deal with injuries from high-velocity weapons and IEDs, which result in complex, deep wounds, burns, and blunt trauma and represent more than ¾ of all wounds, according to the Joint Theatre Trauma Registry [108].
Research continues on numerous fronts in this area, much of it under the sponsorship of the federal Orthopaedic Trauma Research Program (OTRP), which has awarded approximately $14 million in funding during its first 2 years [112]. Projects currently funded by the OTRP include studies of prevention and treatment of heterotopic ossification; rabbit and rat models of osteomyelitis to evaluate infected extremity wounds; novel therapies for A baumannii; cellular therapy for rapid bone formation; and strategies for treating bone defects involving mesenchymal stem cells, antibiotic-impregnated bone cement, and controlled delivery of growth factors [105, 106].
Most recently, a team of military and civilian physicians completed a comprehensive review of data and developed published evidence-based guidelines for prevention of infection after combat-related injuries [71]. These include collection and proper use of cultures, administration of antibiotics within 3 hours of injury, a goal of initial evaluation by a surgeon within 6 hours of injury, use of cefazolin in most cases of extremity injury, use of low-pressure lavage, termination of perioperative antibiotics within 24 to 72 hours after surgery, and guidelines for external and internal fixation. Other priorities for research include the optimal timing for débridement and stabilization, complications that may arise from lengthy air transport, such as hypoxia and anatomic trapped gas that expands at higher altitudes [9, 134], management of segmental bone defects, and multidisciplinary guidelines for treatment of amputees [111].
The experiences of war-time trauma caregivers have had an undeniable impact on civilian practices, with lessons learned in evacuation, wound management, emergency surgery, infection control, and blood banking. Just the same, the capability of combat medical care has always reflected the technology of its time as, for example, wounded were transported by horse-drawn carriages, then trucks, trains, ships, planes, and helicopters. Although war-time physicians experimented with techniques and protocols that eventually contributed greatly to civilian practice, in today’s environment of vast federal funding for health research, programs such as the OTRP bring civilian and military physicians together to seek solutions. Throughout modern warfare, medical care has been reorganized to fit the exigencies of the time and the needs of the wounded. Although the tools and skills available today are more advanced than those possessed by Larrey, Letterman, von Esmarch, and their contemporaries, the mission remains the same.

The Wound-Dresser
By Walt Whitman (1819–1892)
From Drum-Taps (1865)
1
An old man bending I come among new faces,
Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,
Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,
(Arous’d and angry, I’d thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,
But soon my fingers fail’d me, my face droop’d and I resign’d myself,
To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)
Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,
Of unsurpass’d heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)
Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,
Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?
What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,
Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?
2
O maidens and young men I love and that love me,
What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,
Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover’d with sweat and dust,
In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the
rush of successful charge,
Enter the captur’d works–yet lo, like a swift-running river they fade,
Pass and are gone they fade–I dwell not on soldiers’ perils or
soldiers’ joys,
(Both I remember well–many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.)
But in silence, in dreams’ projections,
While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,
So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,
With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up there,
Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)
Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,
Straight and swift to my wounded I go,
Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,
Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,
Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof’d hospital,
To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,
To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,
An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,
Soon to be fill’d with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill’d again.
I onward go, I stop,
With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,
I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,
One turns to me his appealing eyes–poor boy! I never knew you,
Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that
would save you.
3
On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)
The crush’d head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away,)
The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through examine,
Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life
struggles hard,
(Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!
In mercy come quickly.)
From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,
I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood,
Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv’d neck and side falling head,
His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the
bloody stump,
And has not yet look’d on it.
I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,
But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,
And the yellow-blue countenance see.
I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,
Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening,
so offensive,
While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.
I am faithful, I do not give out,
The fractur’d thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,
These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast
a fire, a burning flame.)
4
Thus in silence in dreams’ projections,
Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,
The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,
I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,
Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,
(Many a soldier’s loving arms about this neck have cross’d and rested,
Many a soldier’s kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)
Appendix 2
Wound management in Homer’s Iliad From the translation by Samuel Butler, 1898
Wounded Eurypylus made answer, “Noble Patroclus, there is no hope left for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they that were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the hands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save me and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash the black blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it those gracious herbs which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles, who was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs. For of the physicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one is lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need of healing, while the other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain.”
“Hero Eurypylus,” replied the brave son of Menoetius, “how may these things be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble Achilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so I will not be unmindful your distress.”
With this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent, and a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground for him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp arrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with warm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his hands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which killed all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off flowing.

ESTA and the Visa Waiver Program
Home | Visas | ESTA and the Visa Waiver Program
Visiting the United States Without A Visa
The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables citizens of participating countries to travel to the U.S. for tourism or business for 90 days or less without obtaining a U.S. visa.
These citizens can use the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). A program managed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security.
As the Netherlands participates in the VWP, most Dutch citizens do not need a visa to travel to the U.S.
Read about the VWP and apply for ESTA on the official website
When can’t I use the VWP (ESTA) and need a visa?
Due to personal circumstances:
you traveled to certain countries (Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen on or after March 1, 2011, or Cuba on or after January 12, 2021),
you are a dual national of any of the above mentioned countries,
you’ve been denied an ESTA, visa or entry into the United States in the past,
you overstayed on a previous Visa Waiver visit,
you’re not a citizen from a country participating in the VWP program traveling to the U.S.
this includes passengers in transit
passengers not leaving the plane,
if you might otherwise be ineligible for a visa,  you are not eligible to use the VWP
Because of different purpose of travel:
business travelers and tourists who wish to stay in the U.S. more than 90 days,
airline crew members,
crew members of commercial, private or maritime vessels,
students,
interns,
exchange visitors,
temporary workers
intra-company transfers,
treaty traders,
religious workers,
performers and artists,
representatives of foreign countries on official business,
journalists/media representatives

US-VISIT Program
In order to ensure appropriate safeguards for U.S. national security, the Department of Homeland Security enrolls travelers arriving at U.S. airports and seaports in the US-VISIT program. Enrollment includes collecting a digital photograph and electronic fingerscans of two index fingers. Enrollment takes only seconds and greatly enhances the security of U.S. citizens and visitors to the U.S., facilitates legitimate travel and includes safeguards for the privacy of foreign visitors. Information about US-Visit is available from the Department of Homeland Security’s website.
E-Passport Requirement
Effective July 1, 2009, all Dutch passports issued after October 26, 2006, including emergency and temporary passports, are subject to the electronic passport (e-passport) requirement for travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Any Dutch citizen holding an emergency passport that holds no chip, i.e. not an E-passport, must either apply for a regular Dutch passport or a visa to travel to the United States. Please see the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website.
As of April 1, 2016, all travelers must have an e-passport to use the VWP.  An e-Passport, denoted by the symbol , is an enhanced secure passport with an embedded electronic chip. E-Passports are issued by the proper passport issuing authority and must meet international standards for securing and storing information corresponding to the passport and bearer (source: CBP).

(Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid)
(Article 104(3) of the Rules of Procedure – EEC-Turkey Association Agreement – Article 37 of the Additional Protocol – Direct effect – Working conditions – Principle of non-discrimination – Football – Limit on the number of professional players from non-member States who may be fielded per team in national competitions)
Summary of the Order
1.        International agreements – Agreements concluded by the Community – Direct effect
(Additional Protocol to the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement, Art. 37; Decision No 1/80 of the EEC-Turkey Association Council, Art. 10(1))
2.        International agreements – EEC-Turkey Association Agreement – Workers – Equal treatment
(Additional Protocol to the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement, Art. 37; Decision No 1/80 of the EEC-Turkey Association Council, Art. 10(1))
1.        The wording of Article 37 of the Additional Protocol, annexed to the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement, is essentially the same as that in the first indent of Article 38(1) of the Association Agreement with Slovakia and Article 23(1) of the Communities-Russia Partnership Agreement which lay down, in clear, precise and unconditional terms, a prohibition precluding any Member State from discriminating, on grounds of nationality, against the workers from the non-member State concerned, vis-à-vis their own nationals, so far as their conditions of work, remuneration and dismissal are concerned. Those provisions may therefore be relied on by individuals before the courts of the Member States.
Furthermore, Article 10(1) of Decision No 1/80, which repeats the rule laid down in Article 37 of the Additional Protocol, lays down in clear, precise and unconditional terms a prohibition precluding Member States from discriminating, on the basis of nationality, against Turkish migrant workers duly registered as belonging to their labour force as regards remuneration and other conditions of work.
(see paras 28-29)
2.        The prohibition on all discrimination against Turkish workers duly registered as belonging to the labour force of the Member States with respect to remuneration and other conditions of work, as laid down in Article 37 of the Additional Protocol, annexed to the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement, and Article 10(1) of Decision No 1/80, adopted by the Association Council established by that agreement, on the development of the association, must be interpreted as precluding the application to a professional sportsman of Turkish nationality legally employed by a club established in a Member State, of a rule laid down by a sports association in that State, according to which clubs are authorised to field in competitions organised at national level only a limited number of players from non-member States which are not parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
(see para. 32, operative part)






ORDER OF THE COURT (Fifth Chamber)
25 July 2008 (*)
(Article 104(3) of the Rules of Procedure – EEC-Turkey Association Agreement – Article 37 of the Additional Protocol – Direct effect – Working conditions – Principle of non-discrimination – Football – Limitation of the number of professional players nationals of non-member States who may be fielded per team in national competitions)

Registrar: R. Grass,
the Court proposing to give its decision by reasoned order in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 104(3) of its Rules of Procedure,
after hearing the Advocate General,
makes the following
Order
1        This reference for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article 37 of the Additional Protocol, signed on 23 November 1970 in Brussels and concluded, approved and confirmed on behalf of the Community by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2760/72 of 19 December 1972 (OJ 1973 C 133, p. 17) (‘the Additional Protocol’), annexed to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey, signed at Ankara on 12 September 1963 by the Republic of Turkey, of the one part, and by the Member States of the EEC and the Community, on the other part, and concluded, approved and confirmed on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 64/732/EEC of 23 December 1963 (OJ 1973 C 113, p. 1) (‘the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement’).
2        The reference was made in the course of proceedings between Real Sociedad de Fútbol SAD and Mr Kahveci, on the one hand, and the Consejo Superior de Deportes and the Real Federación Española de Fútbol (Royal Spanish Football Association) (‘RFEF’), on the other, concerning sporting rules which limit the number of players from non-member States who may be fielded in national competitions.
 Legal background
3        The aim of the Association Agreement, according to Article 2(1) thereof, is to promote the continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the parties. To that end, the Association Agreement provides for a preparatory stage enabling the Republic of Turkey to strengthen its economy with aid from the Community (Article 3), a transitional stage, during which a customs union is to be progressively established and economic policies are to be aligned more closely (Article 4) and a final stage which is to be based on the customs union and is to entail closer coordination of the economic policies of the Contracting Parties (Article 5).
4        Article 6 of the Association Agreement is worded as follows:
‘To ensure the implementation and the progressive development of the Association, the Contracting Parties shall meet in a Council of Association which shall act within the powers conferred upon it by this Agreement.’
5        Article 9 of the Association Agreement provides:
‘The Contracting Parties recognise that within the scope of this Agreement and without prejudice to any special provisions which may be laid down pursuant to Article 8, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited in accordance with the principle laid down in Article 7 of the Treaty establishing the Community.’
6        The Additional Protocol, which, according to Article 62 thereof, forms an integral part of the Association Agreement, lays down, in Article 1, the conditions, detailed arrangements and timetables for implementing the transitional stage referred to in Article 4 of that agreement.
7        According to Article 37 of the Additional Protocol:
‘As regards conditions of work and remuneration, the rules which each Member State applies to workers of Turkish nationality employed in the Community shall not discriminate on grounds of nationality between such workers and workers who are nationals of other Member States of the Community.’
8        Article 39(1) of the Additional Protocol is worded as follows:
‘Before the end of the first year after the entry into force of this Protocol the Council of Association shall adopt social security measures for workers of Turkish nationality moving within the Community and for their families residing in the Community.’
9        Article 10(1) of Decision No 1/80 of the Association Council of 19 September 1980 on the development of the Association provides:
‘As regards remuneration and other conditions of work, the rules which the Member States of the Community apply to Turkish workers duly registered as belonging to their labour forces shall not in any way discriminate on grounds of nationality between such workers and Community workers.’
 The dispute in the main proceedings and the question referred for a preliminary ruling
10      Mr Kahveci is a Turkish national residing in Spain where he has residence and work permits. Having been taken on as a professional football player under a contract of employment concluded with the club Real Sociedad de Fútbol SAD, he obtained a federation licence as a non-Community player.
11      Mr Kahveci made an application, through that football club, to the RFEF requesting it to replace his licence with a professional player’s licence identical to those held by Community players. In support of that application he relied on the Association Agreement and the Additional Protocol.
12      According to Article 129 of the RFEF’s General Regulations, a professional footballer’s licence is one issued by the RFEF, enabling that player to play that sport as a member of the federation and to be selected in official matches and competitions as a player belonging to a particular club.
13      Article 173 of the General Regulations provides:
‘Without prejudice to the exceptions laid down herein, in order to register as a professional and obtain a professional licence, a footballer must meet the general requirement of holding Spanish nationality or the nationality of one of the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area.’
14      Article 176(1) of the General Regulations states:
‘Clubs entered for official professional competitions at national level shall be entitled to register foreign non-Community players in the number stipulated in the relevant agreements concluded between the RFEF, national professional football league and the association of Spanish footballers, agreements which also govern the number of such footballers who may be fielded simultaneously …’
15      According to the agreement concluded on 28 May 1999 between the RFEF and the National Professional Football League, the number of players who are not Member State nationals who may be fielded simultaneously in the first division is limited to three for the 2000/2001 to 2004/2005 seasons and, as far as concerns the second division, to three for the 2000/2001 to 2001/2002 seasons and to two for the three following seasons.
16      By decision of 5 February 2002 the RFEF refused Mr Kahveci’s application. Mr Kahveci brought an appeal against that decision before the Consejo Superior de Deportes (Higher Sports Council).
17      As that appeal was dismissed by decision of 26 June 2002 Mr Kahveci challenged that decision before the referring court.
18      In those circumstances, the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling:
‘It is contrary to Article 37 … for a sporting federation to apply to a professional sportsman … a rule by virtue of which clubs may … Does Article 37 [of the Additional Protocol] preclude a sporting federation from applying to a professional sportsman of Turkish nationality, legally employed by a Spanish football club, as in the main proceedings, a rule under which clubs may in national competitions use only a limited number of players from non-member States not belonging to the European Economic Area?’
 The question referred for a preliminary ruling
19      In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 104(3) of the Rules of Procedure, where the answer to a question referred for a preliminary ruling may be clearly deduced from existing case-law the Court may, after hearing the Advocate General, give its decision by reasoned order in which reference is made to its previous judgment or to the relevant case-law.
20       By its question, the referring court asks essentially whether the prohibition on all discrimination against Turkish workers duly registered as belonging to the labour force of a Member State with respect to remuneration and other employment conditions, as laid down in Article 37 of the Additional Protocol and Article 10(1) of Decision No 1/80, must be interpreted as precluding the application to a professional sportsman of Turkish nationality, legally employed by a club established in a Member State, of a rule laid down by a sports association in that State that clubs are authorised to field, in competitions organised at national level, only a limited number of players from non-member States which are not party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
21      That question is similar to that referred to the Court in the cases which gave rise to the judgments in Case C‑438/00 Deutscher Handballbund [2003] ECR I‑4135 and Case C‑265/03 Simuntenkov [2005] ECR I-2579.
22      In the judgment in Deutscher Handballbund, the Court held that the first indent of Article 38(1) of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Slovak Republic, of the other part, signed in Luxembourg on 4 October 1993 and approved on behalf of the Communities by Decision 94/909/EC, ECSC, Euratom of the Council and the Commission of 19 December 1994 (OJ 1993 L 359, p. 1) (‘the Association Agreement with Slovakia’), must be construed as precluding the application to a professional sportsman of Slovak nationality, legally employed by a club established in a Member State, of a rule drawn up by a sports federation in that State under which clubs are authorised to field, during league or cup matches, only a limited number of players from non-member countries that are not parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
23      In the judgment in Simutenkov, in which the same provisions of the RFEF’s General Regulations and the Agreement of 28 May 1999 cited in paragraph 15 of this Order were at issue as those which are the subject-matter of the main proceedings in this case, the Court held that Article 23(1) of the Agreement on partnership and cooperation establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Russian Federation, of the other part, signed in Corfu on 24 June 1994 and approved on behalf of the Communities by Decision 97/800/EC ECSC, Euratom: Council and Commission Decision of 30 October 1997 (OJ 1994 L 327, p. 1) (‘the Communities-Russia Partnership Agreement’), must be construed as precluding the application to a professional sportsman of Russian nationality, legally employed by a club established in a Member State, of a rule drawn up by a sports federation of that State which provides that clubs may field in competitions organised at national level only a limited number of players from countries which are not parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
24      The Court ruled, inter alia, that a rule which limits the number of professional players, nationals of the non-member country in question, who might be fielded in national competitions did relate to working conditions, inasmuch as it directly affected participation in matches of a professional player from that State who was already legally employed in the host Member State (Deutscher Handballbund, cited above, paragraphs 44 to 46).
25      The wording of Article 37 of the Additional Protocol is very similar to that of the first indent of Article 38(1) of the Association Agreement with Slovakia and that of Article 23(1) of the Communities-Russia Partnership Agreement.
26      The first indent of Article 38(1) of the Association Agreement with Slovakia was worded as follows:
‘Subject to the conditions and modalities applicable in each Member State … treatment accorded to workers of Slovak Republic nationality legally employed in the territory of a Member State shall be free from any discrimination based on nationality, as regards working conditions, remuneration or dismissal, as compared to its own nationals’.
27      Article 23(1) of the Communities-Russia Partnership Agreement provided:
‘Subject to the laws, conditions and procedures applicable in each Member State, the Community and its Member States shall ensure that the treatment accorded to Russian nationals legally employed in the territory of a Member State shall be free from any discrimination based on nationality, as regards working conditions, remuneration or dismissal, as compared to its own nationals.’
28      As the Court has observed, such provisions prohibit, in clear, precise and unconditional terms, a prohibition precluding any Member State from discriminating, on grounds of nationality, against workers from the non-member State concerned, vis-à-vis their own nationals, so far as their conditions of work, remuneration and dismissal are concerned. Those provisions may therefore be relied on by individuals before the courts of the Member States (Deutscher Handballbund, paragraphs 28 to 30 and Simutenkov, paragraphs 22 to 24).
29      That finding must be applied to Article 37 of the Additional Protocol the wording of the latter being essentially the same as that of Articles 38(1) of the Association Agreement with Slovakia and 23(1) of the Communities-Russia Partnership Agreement. Furthermore, the Court has already had occasion to state that Article 10(1) of Decision No 1/80, which repeats the rule laid down in Article 37 of the Additional Protocol, lays down in clear, precise and unconditional terms a prohibition precluding the Member States from discriminating, on the basis of nationality, against Turkish migrant workers duly registered as belonging to their labour force as regards remuneration and other conditions of work (Case C‑171/01 Wählergruppe Gemeinsam [2003] ECR I-4301, paragraph 57).
30      Moreover, as the Court has previously held, the finding that the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of nationality against workers of Turkish nationality duly registered as belonging to the labour force of the Member States as regards remuneration and other conditions of work has direct effect is in accordance with the purpose of the Association Agreement. The purpose of the Association Agreement is to establish an association to promote the development of trade and economic relations between the parties, including the progressive achievement of freedom of movement for workers. Such a purpose allows the recognition by the Community of the direct effect of the provisions of that agreement which establish principles which are sufficiently clear and precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (Wählergruppe Gemeinsam, cited above, paragraphs 62, 65 and 66).
31      It is clear from the foregoing that the interpretation adopted by the Court in the judgments in Deutscher Handballbund and Simutenkov is also applicable in the framework of the Association Agreement.
32      Therefore, the answer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling must be that the prohibition on all discrimination against Turkish workers duly registered as belonging to the labour force of the Member States with respect to remuneration and other conditions of work, as laid down in Article 37 of the Additional Protocol and 10(1) of Decision No 1/80, must be interpreted as precluding the application to a professional sportsman of Turkish nationality legally employed by a club established in a Member State, of a rule laid down by a sports association in that State, that clubs are authorised to field in competitions organised at national level only a limited number of players from non-member States which are not parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
 Costs
33      Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.
On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules:
1.      The prohibition on all discrimination against Turkish workers duly registered as belonging to the labour market of the Member States as regards remuneration and other conditions of work, as laid down in Article 37 of the Additional Protocol, signed on 23 November 1970 in Brussels and concluded, approved and confirmed on behalf of the Community by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2760/72 of 19 December 1972, annexed to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey signed at Ankara on 12 September 1963 by the Republic of Turkey, of the one part, and by the Member States of the EEC and the Community, on the other part, and concluded, approved and confirmed on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 64/732/EEC of 23 December 1963 and Article 10(1) of Decision No 1/80 of the Association Council of 19 September 1980 on the development of the Association, must be interpreted as precluding the application to a professional sportsman of Turkish nationality legally employed by a club established in a Member State, of a rule laid down by a sports association in that State, that clubs are authorised to field in competitions organised at national level only a limited number of players from non-member States which are not parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

Reagan's Evolving Views of Russians and their Relevance Today
KENNAN INSTITUTE
By Mary Elizabeth Malinkin
RUSSIA AND EURASIA
""Reagan had the imagination to see beyond the ubiquitous Cold War stereotypes that seemed to be set in stone,"" said Suzanne Massie, author and consultant. At a 1 December 2008 lecture at the Kennan Institute, Massie described her 22 meetings with Ronald Reagan during his presidency.
Massie's first meeting with President Reagan occurred after a particularly memorable visit she made to the Soviet Union in the fall of 1983. One high-ranking Soviet official she talked to during her visit pounded his desk and warned ominously ""You don't know how close war is."" Massie took his warning seriously and determinedly decided to speak to President Reagan upon her return to the United States. First she met with National Security Advisor Robert MacFarlane and suggested that it might be possible to resume cultural exchange talks with the Soviet Union, and after several meetings, she offered ""send me – I can talk to them."" The White House sent Massie on a 10-day secret mission in January 1984 to explore this possibility. Before leaving she met with President Reagan for the first time, in the Oval Office. Upon her return in February 1984, Massie reported to him on the successful results of her trip. Over the next four years Massie met with Reagan twenty more times. These personal interactions enabled Massie to trace changes in Reagan's views of Russians.
Reagan was more interested in what the Russian people thought, and why, than what the Kremlin thought. This inquisitiveness distinguished him from most political figures with whom Massie had talked. Massie's descriptions of the many Russians who had welcomed her into their lives engaged the president's interest. Most importantly, in Massie's opinion, she demonstrated to Reagan that the Russian people were not a ""monolith marching in lock-step toward a glorious Communist future, but a people of vast contrasts and contradictions.""
One of the topics they often discussed was religion. Massie taught Reagan about the historic role and lasting power of Russian Orthodoxy over the lives and mentality of Russians. Reagan was deeply, though discreetly, religious, and learning that the Soviet Union was not completely atheistic made an impression on him. Reagan quickly noticed how much Mikhail Gorbachev himself talked about God. A second topic that Reagan focused on was that of Soviet women. At a meeting of Soviet specialists before Reagan's first trip to Moscow in 1988, Massie suggested that he speak about the importance of Soviet women, pointing out that since they comprised 51 percent of the population, perestroika could not succeed without them. Reagan agreed with her, and his remarks about women during his visits to Russia resonated with the population.
In general, Massie did not interrogate Reagan about his positions, but after 18 meetings, just before his meeting with Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, she once asked him ""What do you want from the Russians, anyway?"" Without hesitation Reagan answered firmly ""I want to get rid of those atomic weapons, every one."" This was the point at which Massie taught Reagan the famous Russian proverb that translates as ""trust, but verify,"" a phrase that he subsequently used on numerous occasions.
In concluding her talk, Massie demonstrated Reagan's relevance today for U.S. policy toward Russia and gave some words of advice to current policymakers. First, Massie said, Reagan respected Gorbachev and treated him as an equal. Gorbachev appreciated this, and for the first time Reagan was able to create an atmosphere of trust between a U.S. president and a leader of the Soviet Union. Respect is of greatest importance to Russians today and can help to foster trust, if not always agreement. President Medvedev recently addressed this important issue, saying in his remarks at the Foreign Policy Association that ""today there is no trust between the United States and Russia."" Second, according to Massie, Reagan kept an open mind without giving up his principles or the national interests of the U.S. He did not let Cold War stereotypes dominate his thinking, contrary to how many officials in Washington do today, Massie added. Reagan had the courage to seek knowledge outside of the policy views that some of his advisors promoted. Third, while adamantly opposed to the Communist regime, Reagan recognized the positive contributions the Russian people had made to the world and understood that they faced many problems and had their own national interests.
When Reagan's presidency ended, he left America's relationship with Russia much better than it had been before him, Massie stated. Russia was one of the most pro-American countries in the world in the early 1990s, but today it has become increasingly anti-American at all levels of society. Massie called for the U.S. to recognize, as Reagan did, that the two countries need each other. Russia today is a different country than it was during the Cold War, and policymakers and the new U.S. president need to cast off outmoded models and rhetoric and forge a new policy that takes new realities into consideration.

George Kennan and Containment
At the end of the war, the Soviet Union was a closed society under the iron grip of Joseph Stalin.
George Kennan
Few in the West had experience with the communist state and even fewer understood what motivated the Soviets. One man who had first hand knowledge was a Foreign Service officer, George F. Kennan. In 1946, while he was Chargé d’Affaires in Moscow, Kennan sent an 8,000-word telegram to the Department—the now-famous “long telegram”—on the aggressive nature of Stalin’s foreign policy. Kennan, writing as “Mr. X,” published an outline of his philosophy in the prestigious journal Foreign Affairs in 1947. His conclusion was that “the main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.” Containment provided a conceptual framework for a series of successful initiatives undertaken from 1947 to 1950 to blunt Soviet expansion.

Linking TB and the Environment: An Overlooked Mitigation Strategy

This article has been corrected. See Environ Health Perspect. 2008 December; 116(12): A519.
One of the world’s leading killers, tuberculosis (TB) is nearly as old as humanity itself; fossilized evidence of this lethal infection has been found in a Homo erectus skeleton half a million years old. But look to a modern hospital in a developed country, and you’d be hard pressed to find more than a few cases. Historically, TB is a disease of the poor. Most of the 2–3 million people who die of the disease every year come from the developing world or from poor, urban neighborhoods in wealthier nations. For centuries, TB has been linked anecdotally with environmental risk factors that go hand-in-hand with poverty: indoor air pollution, tobacco smoke, malnutrition, overcrowded living conditions, and excessive alcohol use. Now scientists are presenting convincing evidence to back these associations, leading some TB experts to argue that control programs must confront underlying risk factors to limit the spread of the disease.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 9 million new cases of TB are diagnosed annually, 55% of them in Asia and 31% in Africa, placing TB second only to HIV/AIDS in terms of the global burden of infectious disease. TB control strategies adopted by the WHO and other organizations emphasize clinical solutions in the form of drugs, vaccines, and access to health care. But despite the success of these programs, TB incidence and mortality aren’t falling rapidly enough to meet WHO targets, and in some areas, particularly in parts of Asia and throughout sub-Saharan Africa, they continue to climb. “Better treatment is essential, but if we want to affect longer-term trends in the epidemic we will also have to deal with risk factors,” asserts Eva Rehfuess, a scientist with the WHO Department of Public Health and Environment. “But doing that won’t be easy. Social and environmental interventions aren’t usually delivered or funded by the health sector, so that means we all have to work with other sectors, in particular housing, energy, and education, to move them forward.”
Emerging evidence suggests such interventions could yield big benefits. In a report published online 3 October 2008 ahead of print in The Lancet, Majid Ezzati and colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health predict that by 2033 TB incidence rates in parts of China could be 14–52% lower if tobacco smoking and indoor air pollution from traditional cooking stoves are eliminated. These reductions assume that 80% of the population already has access to optimal treatments for TB; the benefits would be even greater among those without such access, says Ezzati, an associate professor of global health and environmental health.

The Current Situation
One-third of the world’s population is thought to be infected with various strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the microbe that causes TB, but only 5–10% of infected individuals will develop active disease. Among those with latent infections, which are nontransmissible, M. tuberculosis exists in a mysterious dormant state. Precisely why the bacterium favors latency is unknown. Immunity appears to play a role, given that dormant TB often converts to active disease when immune systems falter, for instance, as a consequence of HIV/AIDS. But some TB strains might also favor latency as an evolved trait that fosters survival, says Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist in the WHO Stop TB Department and coauthor of “Expanding the Global Tuberculosis Control Paradigm: The Role of TB Risk Factors and Social Determinants,” a chapter in the forthcoming WHO report Priority Public Health Conditions: From Learning to Action on Social Determinants of Health. “It’s possible that latency evolved as a mechanism to avoid extinction when human populations were small and isolated,” he explains. “There are lots of ideas, but our understanding of the bacteria is primitive, and we haven’t come close to explaining the basic facts yet.”
TB drugs are a two-edged sword, says Tommie Victor, a professor of health sciences at Stellenbosch University in South Africa’s Western Cape Province. They destroy the bacterium, but can also select for resistant bacteria against which those drugs are then ineffective. In the 1970s, the drugs had the upper hand, and TB seemed to be in decline. But funding and interest in TB control programs also declined, says Victor, and for the following 20 years no systematic monitoring of drug resistance was carried out. The situation changed dramatically with the arrival of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, when transmission of TB and outbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB increased around the globe.
Drug-susceptible TB cases can be cured with a standardized 6-month regimen of first-line antibiotics administered using the “directly observed treatment, short-course,” or DOTS, protocol. Under the DOTS protocol, patients take their daily medication in the presence of a health care worker to ensure compliance. Considered one of the most effective clinical programs ever, DOTS is a cornerstone of the WHO Stop TB Strategy, which by 2015 aims to reduce the incidence of new TB cases to 50% of 1990 levels. (The long-term goal is to reduce annual TB incidence to fewer than 1 case per 1 million people by 2050.)
When TB patients don’t comply with treatment, or when they take their drugs intermittently, resistant bacteria survive preferentially while drug-susceptible strains die. Thus, noncompliant patients diagnosed initially with drug-susceptible TB can “acquire” MDR TB over time. MDR TB now accounts for 1 of every 20 new cases, making the global TB epidemic a far more urgent problem.
Studies by the Boston-based Partners In Health, a nonprofit supplier of health care services to developing countries, have shown MDR TB treatments can achieve cure rates of up to 80%. But MDR TB patients who remain noncompliant with treatment can acquire a still more worrisome form of TB—dubbed extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB—that resists practically every known drug at doctors’ disposal.
This lethal disease, discovered for the first time in 2005 in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal Province, has a far worse prognosis. This is especially true for patients coinfected with HIV/AIDS, which blunts the immune response and severely exacerbates the downward spiral for those sickened by TB. A study published in the 7 August 2008 New England Journal of Medicine found that among 48 XDR TB patients in Peru, daily supervised treatment at community control centers achieved cure rates of 60%. However, none of these patients were HIV-positive. In comparison, all but 1 of 53 HIV-infected individuals stricken with XDR TB in KwaZulu-Natal Province in 2005 and 2006 died within several weeks of developing TB symptoms.
Other researchers have produced particularly dire assessments of XDR TB’s lethality. Citing results from his survey of 4,000 TB cases across several European countries, published in the May 2007 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Giovanni Battista Migliori, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for TB and Lung Diseases, says XDR TB’s mortality rate is up to 5 times greater than that of MDR TB.
It was previously thought that XDR TB, once acquired, might not be infectious beyond hospitals and other clinical settings. XDR TB bacteria were believed to be too weak to be broadly transmissible, presumably because the bacteria are so mutated that they’re generally unhealthy.
Scientists have begun questioning that assumption. Ted Cohen, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, believes some drug-resistant mutations might not exert the so-called fitness costs that would otherwise compromise XDR TB bacteria and weaken them. XDR TB strains that harbor these rare mutations, he predicts, might survive preferentially and eventually predominate over time, especially if more effective drug treatments against these strains remain elusive. Should fit strains prevail, a nightmare scenario might follow: aggressive and transmissible XDR TB spreading inexorably through human populations.
Given the growing global threat of TB, the health sector is working hard to find patients with active disease and get them on a treatment program quickly before they spread the disease. Indeed, active case finding and improved access to health care drive the TB agenda at organizations and institutions such as the WHO and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
But evidence shows that even more than clinical advances, environmental health improvements have driven historical declines in TB prevalence. In 1979, Thomas McKeown, a professor of social medicine at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom, wrote in his book The Role of Medicine that annual TB death rates throughout England and Wales had declined steadily since at least 1838, when they approached nearly 400 per 100,000.
By the time antibiotics and a TB vaccine first became widely available in the 1940s, decreased crowding, better housing, and improved sanitation and nutrition had pushed TB incidence in England and Wales to fewer than 50 deaths per 100,000, McKeown’s analysis shows. At that point, clinical advances both augmented and accelerated rate declines toward their current levels. And in many parts of the developed world, TB rates still decline today. As of 2006, the United Kingdom’s annual TB incidence was 15 cases per 100,000 (with 935 total deaths), according to the WHO, while the annual U.S. rate was 4 per 100,000 (with 1,310 total deaths).
But where poverty lurks and the influence of environmental risk factors grows (including parts of some developed nations), TB rates soar. This is particularly true in Africa, where HIV/AIDS is pervasive, and in Eastern Europe, where health services have broken down following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the WHO reports in Global Tuberculosis Control 2008: Surveillance, Planning, Financing. In Russia’s overcrowded prisons—populated largely by young, poor people, many of whom drink heavily—TB incidence leapt toward 5,000 cases per 100,000 during the late 1990s and early 2000s, with mortality approaching 40% at certain points, among the highest rates in the world, according to Salmaan Keshavjee, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Annual TB incidence in the rural districts surrounding Cape Town, South Africa, where much of the population lives in shantytowns, exceeds 1,300 cases per 100,000, says Victor. South Africa ranks fourth on the WHO’s list of countries with the greatest TB burden, just behind India, China, and Indonesia.
“Our TB patients are practically living on top of each other,” observes Andreas Diacon, a pulmonologist based at Tygerberg Hospital, outside Stellenbosch. “And many of them are malnourished, HIV-positive, and prone to alcohol abuse. Not only does crowding make it more likely that you’ll be exposed to TB, but substance abuse also weakens your immune system. We have statistically more drinkers in both our MDR and XDR populations, and these people are also less likely to stick with medication.”

Confronting Environmental Risk Factors
Those who argue in favor of risk factor interventions say these strategies offer broad population-level benefits. Consider smoking cessation, says Donald Enarson, senior advisor to the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, an independent research and outreach group in Paris. Although its capacity to trigger TB among individuals is surely less than that of HIV/AIDS, smoking might actually trigger more TB cases on a population basis because people who smoke far outnumber those infected with HIV, he says.
Dye and colleagues at the WHO Stop TB Department, including medical officer Knut Lönnroth, have conducted population-level studies of risk factors. According to their analyses, malnutrition, indoor air pollution from solid fuel use, and active smoking constitute the three top population-attributable TB risks globally, followed by HIV infection, diabetes, and excessive drinking. The results will be published in “Expanding the Global Tuberculosis Control Paradigm.”
When considering these factors, it’s important to distinguish infection risks (i.e., situations that bring people who have TB in close contact with others) from those that accelerate disease progression among people who are already infected. For 40 years, crowding has been cited as a crucial infection threat in both industrialized and nonindustrialized countries. But this factor’s unique contribution to TB risk is hard to quantify, concedes Lönnroth. “The relative risks [from crowding] vary with housing quality, TB prevalence in the community, and also with access to health care, which is associated with chance of early cure of infectious cases,” he says.
Recent findings on crowding and TB infection risk were published by Michael Baker and colleagues at the He Kainga Oranga/Housing and Health Research Programme, University of Otago, New Zealand, in the August 2008 Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. The study revealed that among those aged 40 years or younger, every 1% increase in the proportion of overcrowded households in a given census block led to an 8% increase in TB incidence in that block, holding other variables constant.
Those results support more general findings from India, which show that compared with rural areas, TB prevalence rates are consistently higher among urban children aged 9 years or younger. Vineet Chadha, a senior epidemiologist at the National Tuberculosis Institute in Bangalore, who published those findings in the May 2004 issue of the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, says two factors explain the urban/rural discrepancy: first, slum conditions facilitate TB transmission; and second, many urban health practitioners don’t adhere to the DOTS protocol for TB detection and treatment.
The WHO agrees that poverty and urbanization create the perfect conditions for TB transmission. Urbanization leads to higher population densities, crowded living conditions, and increased mobility among migrants seeking temporary work.
A report on crowding and TB, created by researchers at the University of Otago under contract with the WHO, is expected by the end of the year, Rehfuess says. “My sense is that crowding is an important risk factor, but the exposure measures used in epidemiological studies so far haven’t been very reliable,” she says. “So we cannot claim to have conclusive evidence for a causal effect yet.” She points out that many studies show an association—the issue is whether the association is causal or not, as crowding tends to be associated with many other poor socioeconomic and living conditions that could confound the observed relationship.
The links between cigarette smoking and TB, on the other hand, are well documented. Worldwide approximately 1.1 billion people smoke cigarettes, including 930 million in developing or middle-income countries, according to the WHO. At the same time, half the world’s population cooks on open fires or traditional stoves fueled by coal or biomass (wood, animal dung, crop residues, or charcoal), often indoors in poorly ventilated spaces. These stoves produce smoke with chemical constituents—for example, carbon monoxide—similar to those in cigarette smoke. Rehfuess points out that in the developing world most women do not smoke, and most men do not cook for their families. Therefore, in these settings, smoking is one of the greatest TB risk factors for men, whereas indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is likely to be one of the greatest for women. However, a meta-analysis published by Ezzati’s doctoral student Hsien-Ho Lin in the January 2007 PLoS Medicine suggests exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke—not just active smoking—also elevates TB risk, making cigarette smoke exposure a risk factor for both sexes.
Since the 1940s, epidemiologists have tried to isolate the unique contributions of tobacco and biomass smoke to TB risk, but early studies did not control adequately for confounders including socioeconomic status, nutrition, alcohol use, housing, and crowding. A turning point came in 2003, when Vendhan Gajalakshmi, a scientist with the Epidemiological Research Center in Chennai, India, and colleagues published a large retrospective investigation that concluded half the TB mortality among Indian men is triggered by active tobacco smoking. This case–control study of 43,000 male deaths and 35,000 controls was published in the 16 August 2003 issue of The Lancet and sparked a flurry of new investigations.
Lin’s meta-analysis in the January 2007 PLoS Medicine and another by epidemiology professor Michael Bates in the 26 February 2007 Archives of Internal Medicine helped to confirm that smoke and TB are causally linked. By combining data from dozens of existing studies, meta-analyses reinforce shared conclusions, Ezzati explains. “The findings of any single study could be produced by chance, or it could show an effect whose magnitude is smaller or larger than the true one,” he says. “But when you combine many studies that look at the same question and they all point in the same general direction, then you can have more confidence that the conclusion you’re getting is correct.”
Although proposed links between smoke exposure and TB might be more defensible now, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, Ezzati concedes. According to Lin, some scientists speculate that cigarette smoke boosts TB infection risk by impairing the ability of lung cilia to clear bacteria from the respiratory tract.
But exposure might also raise progression risk, adds Adrie Steyn, an assistant professor of microbiology at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, by flooding the body with carbon monoxide. This gas, produced naturally by the body, helps regulate a type of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Evidence suggests apoptosis might account for TB latency. But under high carbon monoxide exposure conditions, such as those induced by cigarette smoking and indoor burning of biomass, apoptosis dramatically declines, Steyn says. And that, he concludes, might allow TB-infected cells to survive and flourish.
More than a matter of medical intrigue, the effects of smoking on the infection/progression continuum pose a real concern for the public health response, Lin says. “DOTS treatment acts on decreasing the probability of infection in the population,” he explains. “If you find that smoking acts more on progression than infection, then DOTS treatment and smoking cessation might complement each other. But if smoking is related more to infection, then the beneficial effect of combining DOTS with smoking cessation is smaller.”
Excessive alcohol use, meanwhile, appears to raise progression and infection risks alike, the former by impairing immune responses, and the latter by inviting risky social interactions that foster transmission of the disease. Smoking and drinking tend to go hand-in-hand, which makes it hard to tease out the effect of one from the other, says Lönnroth. He is lead author of a new meta-analysis of 3 cohort and 18 case–control studies, produced by the WHO Stop TB Department and published 14 August 2008 in BMC Public Health, that strives to isolate alcohol’s role in TB. According to that analysis, TB risk is elevated among people who consume more than 40 grams of alcohol per day (the amount found in roughly three 12-oz glasses of beer, 5-oz glasses of wine, or 1.5-oz shots of hard liquor). “Smoking was controlled for in many but not all of the studies in our review, and when we separated out the studies that controlled for smoking, the relative risk [associated with alcohol] tended to be even higher,” Lönnroth says. “The bottom line is that both are independent risk factors, and together they might be particularly strong risk factors.”
On a population basis, malnutrition ranks as the risk factor most commonly linked with TB, according to the forthcoming “Expanding the Global Tuberculosis Control Paradigm.” Still, “the evidence [for that association] in humans is surprisingly thin from the perspective of scientific rigor,” write J. Peter Cegielski and David N. McMurray in a review of human and animal studies published in the March 2004 issue of the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. Citing evidence from observations in humans, work in experimental animals, and inferences from related studies in other fields, the authors note that a “wealth of ecological associations link TB with malnutrition in populations affected by famine, war, natural disasters, poverty, mass migration, and confinement in prisons or ghettos.”
Still, human studies are problematic, they concede, because TB itself causes wasting, immune system depression, and other symptoms resembling malnutrition. Given that it’s usually impossible to retrospectively discern nutritional status in patients before their TB disease, it’s hard to determine whether malnutrition led to TB or vice versa. This can only be done reliably through cohort studies that follow healthy subjects over time after determining nutrition status at baseline, says Lönnroth.
Studies from animal models focus on the role of micronutrients, such as proteins and vitamins. The results of such studies, Cegielski and McMurray claim, suggest that protein deficiency in particular impedes both innate and vaccine-induced resistance to TB, although precisely how it does so remains unclear. The two authors conclude that in the aggregate, evidence suggests that malnutrition and TB are related; therefore, “nutritional support of undernourished populations at high risk of TB may reduce the incidence of TB in such groups.”
Keshavjee agrees with that conclusion. “When you’re not eating well, you’re probably not producing collagen and immune proteins properly, and that leads to problems with lung parenchyma [i.e., the integrity of the lung tissue itself] and also with immune function,” he says. “We could be talking about something as simple as vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D helps with macrophage function, and macrophages help to clear TB bacteria. So if you don’t have enough [vitamin D], you could be at higher risk.”
Adding to a link with nutrition is growing evidence that diabetes exacerbates TB risk. A meta-analysis by Christie Jeon and Megan Murray, published 15 July 2008 in PLoS Medicine, concluded “diabetes is associated with TB risk regardless of study design and population.” Indeed, says Enarson, with an increase in high-fat/low-nutrition diets with and lack of exercise, the combination of diabetes and smoking will probably cause more TB worldwide in the next 2 to 3 years than any other factor.

Applying Risk Factors to TB Control
With accumulating evidence showing that environmental factors exacerbate TB risk, health experts are contemplating how to incorporate these findings into TB control programs. For a start, says Rehfuess, health professionals should inform patients and their families of the potential harm resulting from excessive drinking, smoking, indoor biomass burning, and other practices. “Raising awareness and creating demand for solutions will not solve the problem,” she says, “but it could be a stepping stone. And even that is not happening.”
Murray and others suggest that high-risk populations, including smokers and diabetic patients, might be targeted for active case finding. Locating patients with TB remains a difficult challenge. The disease can take weeks to diagnose; meanwhile, untreated patients pose infection risks to their communities. Looking within high-risk populations might make those efforts more efficient. Moreover, tying case detection to enticements such as improved cooking stoves might also make for good strategy, Ezzati proposes. “Those who agree to be tested for TB regularly, along with those who agree to quit smoking, might be entitled to a clean stove benefit,” Ezzati says. “And that would have benefits beyond TB, because these pollutants also increase risks for other lung diseases.”
Partners In Health has already incorporated risk factors into their treatment approach, Keshavjee says. The organization supports community treatment programs and helps families pay to build an additional room to house the infected patient, thereby reducing the risk of crowding, while also supplying clean fuels such as kerosene to reduce indoor air pollution. Keshavjee concedes these measures come at a cost to the organization, but he emphasizes the downstream expenses posed by inadequately treated TB are far higher.
Thus far, the WHO hasn’t integrated risk factors into its TB control efforts. The problem, Dye points out, is that changes in the risk factor trends that have traditionally accompanied TB fluctuations occur slowly—over decades or even centuries. “Smoke exposure and other factors heighten TB risk, but it’s difficult to imagine how we could manipulate these things to bring down TB incidence quickly,” he says. “It would be beneficial if these risk factors did-n’t exist, but they’re not going to replace prompt drug treatment, which is still the most powerful way to save lives quickly and reduce transmission. Risk factor interventions are useful, but they’re supplementary.”
Still, the authors of “Expanding the Global Tuberculosis Control Paradigm” acknowledge that “even if the Stop TB strategy is successfully implemented . . . the global incidence rate by 2050 would be about 100 times greater than the elimination target. Interventions to reduce progression to disease may include preventive treatment with anti-TB drugs, a new vaccine that prevents progression from infection to disease, as well as reducing exposure to various social, environmental, and biological risk factors for TB.” Adds Keshavjee, “[Environmental] risk factor controls have not typically been under the purview of the TB community. To address them, we have to think outside the box.”

U-2 Overflights and the Capture of Francis Gary Powers, 1960
On May 1, 1960, the pilot of an American U-2 spyplane was shot down while flying though Soviet airspace. The fallout over the incident resulted in the cancellation of the Paris Summit scheduled to discuss the ongoing situation in divided Germany, the possibility of an arms control or test ban treaty, and the relaxation of tensions between the USSR and the United States.
Francis Gary Powers with model of U-2 plane
As early as 1955, officials in both Moscow and Washington had grown concerned about the relative nuclear capabilities of the Soviet Union and the United States. Given the threat that the nuclear arms race posed to national security, leadership in both countries placed a priority on information about the other side’s progress. At a conference in Geneva in 1955, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower proposed an “open skies” plan, in which each country would be permitted to make overflights of the other to conduct mutual aerial inspections of nuclear facilities and launchpads. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev refused the proposal, continuing the established Soviet policy of rejecting international inspections in any form. Meanwhile, Khrushchev also claimed that the Soviet Union had developed numerous intercontinental ballistic missiles, which only motivated the United States Government to look for new ways to verify developments in the Soviet nuclear program.
The U-2 spyplane program grew out of these concerns. The U-2 was a special high-altitude plane that flew at a ceiling of 70,000 feet. Because it flew at such heights, it was thought it would be possible for the planes to pass over the Soviet Union undetected by radar on the ground. It was important that the overflights be undetected, because normally an unauthorized invasion of another country’s airspace was considered an act of war. Operated through the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the first flight over Moscow and Leningrad (St. Petersburg) took place on July 4, 1956. The flights continued intermittently over the next four years. It was later revealed that the Soviets did pick up the flights on radar, and the United States lost a plane over the Soviet Union in 1959, but as long as there was no definitive proof connecting the flights to the United States there was no advantage for the Soviets to raise the issue publicly lest it draw attention to the Soviet inability to shoot down the offending flights.
Powers Trial
On May 1, 1960, the situation changed. On the eve of the Paris Summit and during the May Day holiday, CIA pilot Francis Gary Powers took off from a base in Pakistan bound for another base in Norway, with his planned flight path transgressing 2,900 miles of Soviet airspace. Near the city of Sverdlovsk Oblast in the Ural Mountains, Powers' plane was shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile. Powers ejected and parachuted safely to the ground, where he was captured by the KGB, and held for interrogation. The plane crashed, but parts of it were recovered and placed on public display in Moscow as evidence of American deceit.
Although the capture of Powers provided the Soviets the concrete proof that the United States had been conducting the flights, it was not immediately clear what the impact would be for the Paris Summit. At first, and before they had confirmation that Powers had survived, U.S. officials claimed that the U-2 had been conducting a routine weather flight but experienced a malfunction of its oxygen delivery system that had caused the pilot to black out and drift over Soviet air space. On May 7, however, Khrushchev revealed that Powers was alive and uninjured, and clearly had not blacked out from oxygen deprivation. Moreover, the Soviets recovered the plane mostly intact, including the aerial camera system. It became instantly apparent that the weather survey story was a cover-up for a spy program. Khrushchev had publicly committed himself to the idea of “peaceful coexistence” with the United States and the pursuit of détente, so from his perspective, if U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower denied any knowledge of the spy program and the United States apologized, he would have continued the summit. Spying was common, and of course, the Soviet Union had its own agents reporting on developments in the United States. Eisenhower, however, refused to issue a formal apology to the Soviet Union; he had taken a great personal interest in the spyplane program, and considered the violation of Soviet airspace and the reconnaissance of Soviet nuclear facilities serious enough to personally approve each flight. On May 11, Eisenhower finally acknowledged his full awareness of the entire program and of the Powers flight in particular. Moreover, he explained that in the absence of an “open skies” agreement, such spy flights were a necessary element in maintaining national defense, and that he planned to continue them.
Wreckage of crashed U-2 Plane
Eisenhower’s statement left Khrushchev in a difficult position. If he did nothing, that would be tantamount to acknowledging implicitly the right of the United States to spy. But any action Khrushchev did take had the potential to scuttle the upcoming conference and his larger plans for a Soviet-American détente. Ultimately, he demanded that Eisenhower apologize for the past flights and promise to discontinue them as a precondition for entering into the planned negotiations on Germany. Eisenhower’s refusal led the Soviet delegation to leave Paris just as the summit was about to begin.
After extensive questioning by the KGB, Powers was convicted of spying and sentenced to three years in prison and seven more of hard labor. In February, 1962, however, he and a detained American student were traded for a captured Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel. Although Eisenhower refused to end the U-2 program, it was quickly overtaken by new technology, as satellite images replaced aerial photographs. For his part, Khrushchev abandoned his attempts to cooperate with Eisenhower, opting instead to wait for the inauguration of the new U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, elected to office in November, 1960.

Allied Occupation of Germany, 1945-52
After Germany's defeat in the Second World War, the four main allies in Europe - the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France - took part in a joint occupation of the German state. With the original understanding that the country would eventually be reunified, the Allied Powers agreed to share the responsibility of administering Germany and its capital, Berlin, and each took responsibility for a certain portion of the defeated nation. This arrangement ultimately evolved into the division of Germany into a Western and an Eastern sector, thereby contributing to the Cold War division of Europe.
During the Second World War, one of the major topics under discussion at conferences of the Allied leadership was how to deal with Germany after the war. Having experienced great losses as a result of German invasions in the First and Second World Wars, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin preferred that a defeated Germany be dismembered and divided so that it could not rise to its former strength to threaten European peace and security again. At the Tehran Conference between U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1943, the two countries agreed that after the war Germany would be divided and occupied jointly. At the final wartime conference between these two men at Yalta in 1945, the two powers agreed to shift the eastern border of Germany to the West, enlarging western Poland as compensation for the eastern sections of that country annexed by the Soviet Union. They also determined that the occupation would divide Germany into sections, with each Allied power taking responsibility for one section, although they would be governed as a single economic unit in anticipation of their eventual reunification. Finally, they also concluded that they would demand reparations from Germany, although they did not yet agree on exactly how much they would request. A meeting later in 1945 between Stalin and new U.S. President Harry Truman held at Potsdam confirmed and ratified these arrangements.
After the victory over the Axis powers, however, the wartime cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union soon faded. In reality, mutual distrust ruled the relationship between the two countries, and nowhere was this more evident than in the difficulties over the occupation of Germany. The Allies agreed to a joint occupation, with each country taking charge of a larger zone and a sector of the nation's capital, Berlin. Upon British insistence, France joined Great Britain and the United States in the occupation of West Germany and West Berlin, while the Soviet Union managed the affairs of East Germany and East Berlin.
The divided Germany was weak and dependent on the allies for goods and the differing approaches of the occupying powers served to establish what would become a stark contrast between the two Germanys. The Soviet Union stripped its sector of manufacturing equipment in an effort to garner partial payment for wartime remittances, further stifling the reemergence of a strong German economy. In the western sector, military leaders from the United States soon grew concerned about the economic costs of a Germany completely dependent on the United States, and the United States began investing in German industries. In 1946, the United States and Great Britain merged their occupation zones, and in 1947 the U.S. Government began a massive aid program under the Marshall Plan, which pumped dollars and goods into Europe to aid in recovery. The Soviet Union prevented the countries along the Soviet border in Eastern Europe, many of which had experienced the rise of communist leadership in the wake of the war, from taking part in the arrangement. Instead it offered the Soviet Union offered its own postwar program for economic aid.
By 1948, the Western Allies began the project of pulling their occupation zones together for the sake of rebuilding - a project that the Soviet Union, still worried about a Germany threat to its security, wished to prevent. Although the Western Allies made frequent suggestions for the terms under which the country might be reunified, usually involving the introduction of free and democratic elections and German autonomy for conducting its own foreign policy. These proposals were never made in terms that the Soviet Union would consider accepting, so the continued division of the country was in many ways inevitable. In June 1948, the Soviet Union took action against the West's policies by blocking all road access between West Germany and West Berlin, effectively cutting off the city's occupation zones from the British, French, and American forces responsible for maintaining them. The administrators of the western zones had no agreement with the Soviet Union that required the latter to allow ground access to the city through Eastern Germany, but they did have an agreement on air access. As a result, the United States began an airlift of supplies to the stranded citizens of West Berlin. Over the course of the next eleven months of the blockade, the Americans, assisted by the British and the French, supplied West Berlin entirely by air, landing planes filled with food, clothing, and coal for heat nearly every minute. Because it was a mild winter, they were able to keep ahead of the city's requirements, and the extraordinary accomplishments of the Berlin Airlift became an early propaganda success for the West in the emerging Cold War. After nearly a year, the Soviet Union lifted the blockade, making it once again possible to supply West Berlin overland. The blockade and airlift contributed to cementing the division of Germany and Europe into East and West.
The Soviet Union was not alone in worrying over the threat to European security that could come of a revitalized Germany. Countries to the west, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg, were also wary and preferred a neutral and demilitarized Germany. To address these concerns, the British proposed a collective security arrangement that would include these nations, plus Britain, West Germany and the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formally established in 1949.
In 1949, the occupying powers in both East and West Germany replaced their military governors with civilian leaders, and the occupations ended officially in the mid-1950s. Even so, both sides retained a strong interest in Germany, and the country and its capital remained divided throughout the Cold War. Reunification finally took place in October of 1990.

Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia, 1968
On August 20, 1968, the Soviet Union led Warsaw Pact troops in an invasion of Czechoslovakia to crack down on reformist trends in Prague. Although the Soviet Union’s action successfully halted the pace of reform in Czechoslovakia, it had unintended consequences for the unity of the communist bloc.

Before the Second World War, the nation of Czechoslovakia had been a strong democracy in Central Europe, but beginning in the mid 1930s it faced challenges from both the West and the East. In 1938, the leadership in Great Britain and France conceded the German right to takeover the Sudetenland in the Munich Agreement, but the Czech government condemned this German occupation of its western-most territory as a betrayal. In 1948, Czech attempts to join the U.S.-sponsored Marshall Plan to aid postwar rebuilding were thwarted by Soviet takeover and the installation of a new communist government in Prague. For the next twenty years, Czechoslovakia remained a stable state within the Soviet sphere of influence; unlike in Hungary or Poland, even the rise of de-Stalinization after 1953 did not lead to liberalization by the fundamentally conservative Czech government.
In the 1960s, however, changes in the leadership in Prague led to a series of reforms to soften or humanize the application of communist doctrines within Czech borders. The Czech economy had been slowing since the early 1960s, and cracks were emerging in the communist consensus as workers struggled against new challenges. The government responded with reforms designed to improve the economy. In early 1968, conservative leader Antonin Novotny was ousted as the head of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and he was replaced by Alexander Dubcek. The Dubcek government ended censorship in early 1968, and the acquisition of this freedom resulted in a public expression of broad-based support for reform and a public sphere in which government and party policies could be debated openly. In April, the Czech Government issued a formal plan for further reforms, although it tried to liberalize within the existing framework of the Marxist-Leninist State and did not propose a revolutionary overhaul of the political and economic systems. As conflicts emerged between those calling for further reforms and conservatives alarmed by how far the liberalization process had gone, Dubcek struggled to maintain control.
Soviet leaders were concerned over these recent developments in Czechoslovakia. Recalling the 1956 uprising in Hungary, leaders in Moscow worried that if Czechoslovakia carried reforms too far, other satellite states in Eastern Europe might follow, leading to a widespread rebellion against Moscow’s leadership of the Eastern Bloc. There was also a danger that the Soviet Republics in the East, such as the Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia might make their own demands for more liberal policies. After much debate, the Communist Party leadership in Moscow decided to intervene to establish a more conservative and pro-Soviet government in Prague.
The Warsaw Pact invasion of August 20–21 caught Czechoslovakia and much of the Western world by surprise. In anticipation of the invasion, the Soviet Union had moved troops from the Soviet Union, along with limited numbers of troops from Hungary, Poland, East Germany and Bulgaria into place by announcing Warsaw Pact military exercises. When these forces did invade, they swiftly took control of Prague, other major cities, and communication and transportation links. Given the escalating U.S. involvement in the conflict in Vietnam as well as past U.S. pronouncements on non-intervention in the East Bloc, the Soviets guessed correctly that the United States would condemn the invasion but refrain from intervening. Although the Soviet crackdown on Czechoslovakia was swift and successful, small-scale resistance continued throughout early 1969 while the Soviets struggled to install a stable government. Finally, in April of 1969, the Soviets forced Dubcek from power in favor of a more conservative administrator. In the years that followed, the new leadership reestablished government censorship and controls preventing freedom of movement, but it also improved economic conditions, eliminating one of the sources for revolutionary fervor. Czechoslovakia once again became a cooperative member of the Warsaw Pact.
The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was significant in the sense that it delayed the splintering of Eastern European Communism and was concluded without provoking any direct intervention from the West. Repeated efforts in the UN Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the attacks met with opposition from the Soviet Union, and the effort finally died away. The invasion did, however, temporarily derail progress toward détente between the Soviet Union and the United States. The NATO allies valued the idea of a lessening of tensions, and as a result they were determined not to intervene. Still, the invasion forced U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to cancel a summit meeting with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Although Brezhnev knew this was the most likely outcome of the invasion, he considered maintaining Soviet control in the East Bloc a higher priority in the short-term than pursuing détente with the West. As it turned out, the progress on arms control agreements were only delayed by a few years in the aftermath of the Prague Spring.
There were also long-term consequences. After the invasion, the Soviet leadership justified the use of force in Prague under what would become known as the Brezhnev Doctrine, which stated that Moscow had the right to intervene in any country where a communist government had been threatened. This doctrine, established to justify Soviet action in Czechoslovakia, also became the primary justification for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, and even before that it helped to finalize the Sino-Soviet split, as Beijing feared that the Soviet Union would use the doctrine as a justification to invade or interfere with Chinese communism. Because the United States interpreted the Brezhnev Doctrine and the history of Soviet interventions in Europe as defending established territory, not expanding Soviet power, the aftermath of the Czech crisis also lent support to voices in the U.S. Congress calling for a reduction in U.S. military forces in Europe.

Austrian State Treaty, 1955
On May 15, 1955, representatives of the governments of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, the United States, and France signed a treaty that granted Austria independence and arranged for the withdrawal of all occupation forces. These governments signed the agreement with the understanding that the newly independent state of Austria would declare its neutrality, creating a buffer zone between the East and the West. The Austrian State Treaty was the only treaty signed by both the Soviet Union and United States in the decade after the 1947 Paris Peace Treaties, and it marked the only Cold War era withdrawal by the Soviet Union from a territory it occupied.
The Austrian situation was unique in postwar Europe. In 1938, it had been the only nation to be annexed in its entirety by Nazi Germany, a fact that raised consistent questions during the war about the extent to which the country was a victim of Nazi aggression or whether it had been a collaborator. At the Potsdam Conference in 1945, the Allies agreed that they would jointly occupy Austria in the postwar period, dividing the country and its capital Vienna into four zones as they planned to do with Germany and Berlin. The Soviets also demanded reparations from Austria, a request that was dropped due to the country's nonbelligerent status, but the United States did agree that the Soviet Union would be entitled to any German assets in the Soviet occupation zone. In contrast to Germany, the Austrian government continued to exist in the postwar period and govern, although the Four Powers could veto any new legislation if they unanimously agreed to do so. This arrangement was maintained until the withdrawal of the occupying powers upon the completion of the Austrian State Treaty.
The breakdown of the wartime ""Grand Alliance"" and the emergence of the Cold War led to the Austrian occupation lasting far longer than anyone anticipated. Negotiations over the final status of Austria began in 1947, when half of fifty-nine proposed articles for a treaty were agreed upon. At the first meeting, the foreign ministers agreed to name the agreement under negotiation the Austrian State Treaty, not the Austrian Peace Treaty, to acknowledge that Austria's involvement in the war had not been voluntary and that the treaty was therefore not to end a war, but to reestablish an independent state. The principle sticking point during the 1947 negotiations was the issue of German assets: how they were defined and just how much compensation the Soviet Union was entitled to take. The Soviet occupation forces had seized control of factories, railroads, as well as oil and shipping concerns, all of which had been under Nazi control at one point or another, and only offered to sell them back to the struggling Austrian provisional government at exorbitant prices. As a solution to this situation, France suggested a revenue-sharing plan, in which some profits from the formerly German-held industries would be sold back to Austrians and some would operate independently, with the Austrian State and occupying powers sharing their revenue, but then the Soviet Union refused the treaty, claiming some Austrian territories on behalf of the government of Yugoslavia. The parties finally reached an agreement in 1949 in which the West would offer economic concessions to the Soviet Union in exchange for the Soviet relinquishment of Yugoslav claims. Just when a deal appeared imminent, the Soviet Union again opted not to sign; in fact, at several points throughout the process the Soviet Union delayed completion of the treaty while it reconsidered what benefits it hoped to gain from the agreement.
Between 1950 and 1953, tense Cold War relations and the existence of a hot war in Korea also contributed to stalling the talks on the Austrian situation. Then, after the death of former premier Joseph Stalin in 1953, his successors in the Soviet Union launched a ""peace offensive"" to try to decrease international tensions. Although there were some concrete indications of the new policy, such as relaxed controls in East Berlin and the newfound willingness of the Chinese to discuss Korean War POW exchanges after Chinese leaders visited Moscow, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower stated that he would only agree to holding a summit meeting with the Soviet Union if there were several clear indications that Soviet actions would match its rhetoric of peace. One of the examples he named was the completion of the Austrian State Treaty. Even before negotiations on the treaty restarted, there were indications that Soviet policy toward Austria was liberalizing, as it loosened restrictions on the press and travel in and out of its sector and also worked to establish formal diplomatic relations with the Austrian Government.
With the German assets question all but settled in the last set of draft treaties, the question holding up the negotiations at this stage was the issue of Austrian neutrality. The Austrian Foreign Minister went through the neutral government of India to inform the Soviet Union that if a treaty was signed, independent Austria would also remain neutral, staying out of NATO or other defensive arrangements. Eisenhower was against neutrality on principle, and he was both angered by this maneuver and hopeful that Austrian neutrality could still be prevented. One particular danger was that West Germans, anxious for their nation's own reunification, would follow the Austrian example and offer their neutrality in an effort to expedite unification. German neutrality would have greater implications for American security plans in Europe than Austrian neutrality would. In late 1954, the West German Government and the Western powers at last reached an agreement under which Germans would rearm under the NATO command, reassuring the United States.
Finally, in April of 1955, and after substantial debate on both sides, representatives of the Austrian Government traveled to Moscow and returned just four days later with a complete treaty that outlined compensation to the Soviet Union for German assets and the nature of Austrian neutrality. U.S. officials demanded two changes in the treaty regarding the upper limit placed on Austrian armed forces and the removal of a clause on voluntary repatriation of displaced persons that they feared could be used by the Soviet Union to force anticommunist refugees to return to East Bloc countries. The Soviets conceded on both points. The overall terms of the treaty were less favorable to the Soviet Union than previous proposals, but the timing was right for the USSR to initiate its withdrawal from Austria. On May 15, representatives from Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union signed the Austrian State Treaty, ending seventeen years of occupation by foreign troops. As promised, the newly-independent nation declared and maintained its neutrality for the remainder of the Cold War.

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), 1968
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was an agreement signed in 1968 by several of the major nuclear and non-nuclear powers that pledged their cooperation in stemming the spread of nuclear technology. Although the NPT did not ultimately prevent nuclear proliferation, in the context of the Cold War arms race and mounting international concern about the consequences of nuclear war, the treaty was a major success for advocates of arms control because it set a precedent for international cooperation between nuclear and non-nuclear states to prevent proliferation.

After the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, leaders of both nations hoped that other, more comprehensive agreements on arms control would be forthcoming. Given the excessive costs involved in the development and deployment of new and more technologically advanced nuclear weapons, both powers had an interest in negotiating agreements that would help to slow the pace of the arms race and limit competition in strategic weapons development. Four years after the first treaty, the two sides agreed to an Outer Space Treaty that prevented the deployment of nuclear weapons systems as satellites in space. Of far greater import, Soviet and U.S. negotiators also reached a settlement on concluding an international non-proliferation treaty.
By the beginning of the 1960s, nuclear weapons technology had the potential to become widespread. The science of exploding and fusing atoms had entered into public literature via academic journals, and nuclear technology was no longer pursued only by governments, but by private companies as well. Plutonium, the core of nuclear weapons, was becoming easier to obtain and cheaper to process. As a result of these changes, by 1964 there were five nuclear powers in the world: in addition to the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, all of which obtained nuclear capability during or shortly after the Second World War, France exploded its first nuclear bomb in 1960, and the People’s Republic of China was not far behind in 1964. There were many other countries that had not yet tested weapons, but which were technologically advanced enough that should they decide to build them, it was likely that they could do so before long.
The spread of nuclear weapons technology meant several things for international lawmakers. While the only countries that were capable of nuclear strike were the United States, its close ally Britain, and the Soviet Union, the doctrine of deterrence could be reasonably maintained. Because both sides of the Cold War had vast stocks of weapons and the capability of striking back after being attacked, any strike would likely have led to mutually assured destruction, and thus there remained a strong incentive for any power to avoid starting a nuclear war. However, if more nations, particularly developing nations that lay on the periphery of the balance of power between the two Cold War superpowers, achieved nuclear capability, this balance risked being disrupted and the system of deterrence would be threatened. Moreover, if countries with volatile border disputes became capable of attacking with nuclear weapons, then the odds of a nuclear war with truly global repercussions increased. This also caused the nuclear states to hesitate in sharing nuclear technology with developing nations, even technology that could be used for peaceful applications. All of these concerns led to international interest in a nuclear non-proliferation treaty that would help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
Although the benefits to be derived from such a treaty were clear, its development was not without controversy. A ban on the distribution of nuclear technology was first proposed by Ireland in a meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1961. Although the members approved the resolution, it took until 1965 for negotiations to begin in earnest at the Geneva disarmament conference. At that time, U.S. negotiators worked to strike a delicate balance between the interest in preventing further transfer of the technology that it shared with the Soviet Union and the desire to strengthen its NATO allies by giving several Western European nations some measure of control over nuclear weapons. The plan for a nuclear NATO threatened to scuttle the talks altogether, and the United States eventually abandoned it in favor of reaching a workable treaty. A more difficult problem involved the question of bringing non-nuclear nations into line with the planned treaty. Nations that had not yet developed nuclear weapons technology were essentially being asked to give up all intentions to ever develop the weapons. Without this agreement on the part of the non-nuclear powers, having the nuclear powers vow never to transfer the technology would likely not result in any real limitation on the number of worldwide nuclear powers. After two years of negotiations, the nuclear powers managed to make enough concessions to induce many non-nuclear powers to sign.
The final treaty involved a number of provisions all aimed at limiting the spread of nuclear weapons technology. First, the nuclear signatories agreed not to transfer either nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons technology to any other state. Second, the non-nuclear states agreed that they would not receive, develop or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons. All of the signatories agreed to submit to the safeguards against proliferation established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Parties to the treaty also agreed to cooperate in the development of peaceful nuclear technology and to continue negotiations to help end the nuclear arms race and limit the spread of the technology. The treaty was given a 25-year time limit, with the agreement that it would be reviewed every 5 years.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was, and continues to be, heralded as an important step in the ongoing efforts to reduce or prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Still, it had one major drawback in that two nuclear powers, France and the People’s Republic of China, did not sign the agreement, nor did a number of non-nuclear states. Of the non-nuclear states refusing to adhere, and thereby limit their own future nuclear programs, of particular importance were Argentina, Brazil, India, Israel, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, because these powers were close to being capable of the technology. In fact, in 1974, India joined the “nuclear club” by exploding its first weapon. Pakistan tested its first atomic bomb in 1983.

Abstract
The medical discipline of narcology in Russia is a subspecialty of psychiatry from the Soviet era and it is given warrant to define the scope of health activities with regard to alcohol and other drug use, drug users, and related problems. Narcological practice is in turn constrained by the State. The emergence of widespread injection opiate use and associated HIV morbidities and mortalities during the first decade following the collapse of the Soviet Union has brought the contradictions in Russian narcological discourse into high relief. Narcology officials in the Russian Federation have consistently opposed substitution treatment for opiate dependence – the replacement of a short-acting illegal substance with a longer acting prescribed drug with similar pharmacological action but lower degree of risk. Thus, despite the addition of methadone and buprenorphine to WHO's list of essential medicines in 2005 and multiple position papers by international experts calling for substitution treatment as a critical element in the response to HIV (IOM, 2006; UNODC, UNAIDS, and WHO, 2005), methadone or buprenorphine remain prohibited by law in Russia.
The authors detail Russian opposition to the prescription of methadone and buprenorphine, describing four phenomena: (1) the dominance of law enforcement and drug control policy over public health and medical ethics ; (2) the conflation of Soviet era alcoholism treatment with treatment for opiate dependence; (3) the near universal representation of detoxification from drugs as treatment for dependence; and (4) a framework for judging treatment efficacy that is restricted to ""cure"" versus ""failure to cure,"" and does not admit its poor outcomes or recognize alternative frameworks for gauging treatment of opiate dependence. In keeping with this position, Russian narcology officials have taken an implacable ideological stance toward illicit drug use, the people who use drugs, and their treatment. By adopting policies and practices totally unsupported by scientific evidence and inquiry, officials in Russia have rendered narcology ( and medical practice) insensitive to the alarming rates and continued spread of HIV, with its dire morbidity and mortality rates in the Russian Federation, turning their backs on all the other health problems posed by opiate use and dependence itself.

Editorial
The spring of 2008 marks the opening of a year of reflection meant to culminate in a high-level United Nations meeting assessing progress since the 1998 UN General Assembly Special Session on Drugs. Whatever member states declare about the international drug control regime, it is clear that in Russia we are bearing witness to one of the catastrophes in the history of HIV – the lack of response to the epidemic in Russia. In particular, we must point to the special responsibility that Russian medical and public health officials bear for creating and sustaining this deadly situation. The roots of the problem lie in their basic position on the problem of drug use and addiction – a rejection both of the core principles of harm reduction and of the usual obligations of medicine (as expressed in the Hippocratic oath) to ""first do no harm"". Indeed, the leaders of the sub-discipline of Russian psychiatry known as ""narcology"" seem to assume no special obligation to save lives, offering substandard treatments and insisting on their value. As a consequence, treatment for opiate dependence serves the end of social control and enforcement, but they do little to treat addiction.
An arm of the state, narcological dispensaries are scattered throughout Russia. These offices are structured primarily to provide detoxification for opiate users and alcoholics, and most provide few or no harm reduction interventions to reduce HIV and hepatitis among users. The academic leaders of narcology officially determine the scope of public health and risk reduction interventions and decide which are to be regarded as effective. Despite the addition of methadone and buprenorphine to WHO's essential medicines list, Russia outlaws any form of substitution treatment. These failures of narcology can be seen as an engine driving the HIV epidemic in Russia and, through its omissions, commissions, gaps, and blockages – making it worse each day.
With nearly one million HIV infections, some 80 percent of which are related to the sharing of drug injection equipment, Russia has the fastest growing HIV epidemic in the world.
Despite their proven efficacy, syringe availability, ready access to methadone and buprenorphine for maintenance, or effective social support programs for drug users all remains very limited in Russia. In contrast to the United States, it is methadone that remains the most contested of harm reduction interventions in Russia. ""The misguided practice of issuing addicts a ""narcotic ration"" was long ago prohibited. [1:253]""declared Edward Babayan, a pioneer of narcology in the former Soviet Union, in a text book for psychiatrists regarded as primary in the field. This statement is the only reference in the entire textbook to drug substitution treatment, and no history is provided of the approach before it was prohibited, nor any explanation or evidence for terming it a ""misguided practice"" nor. As with narcological pronouncements more generally in Russia, the hierarchical status of the author substitutes for science.
Consistent evidence from around the world shows that opiate dependence treatments work most effectively when they widen from an exclusive goal of abstinence and seek to foster multiple outcomes – including reduction in use of illicit opiates, reduction in injections and exposures to blood-borne infections such as HIV and hepatitis, reduction in drug overdoses, better management of existing health problems, and improvement of normative social functioning. While some 800,000 patients now have access to methadone and buprenorphine, the position of many narcologists in Russia is that the world is turning away from the medications, indicating Russian reluctance to implement them.
Vladimir Mendelevich, a Russian psychiatrist who has actively critiqued the dominant narcological model, reported at a 2006 satellite meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (UN CND) findings from his recent research [2] that: (1) the majority of narcologists in Russia offer nothing but heavily medicalized detoxification; (2) the majority of patients relapse within six months, and (3) the majority of narcologists are satisfied with the field and do not think major changes are required. Echoing the declarations of Edward Babayan (2001) and Nikolai Ivanets (1998), now head of a leading Russian narcological institution, the discipline in Russia has consistently aligned itself with the restrictive and punitive. Babayan was the author of the infamous ""drug table"" that subjected those in possession of the residue in a used syringe to years of imprisonment, and those possessing as little as a single dose of heroin liable to still longer incarceration. In this context, resistance of Russian addiction professionals to substitution treatment can be seen as expressing the underlying conviction that illicit drug users are a criminal class that needs to be put under control, and if necessary, isolation.
The approach that regards addicts as criminals is based on a number of categorical assumptions, unsupported by empirical data: (1) the patient does not realize his social and health danger; (2) the patient does not completely understand the character of his own activity; (3) the patient cannot control it; (4) the patient brings harm to himself and his surroundings [3]. In the circular thinking that confounds clinical practice with law enforcement, any user of a narcotic that he or she was not prescribed by a physician is an abuser likely to cause harm to self or others [1,4].
These attitudes and policies have much in common with Federal policies in the US. Like Russia, the US emphasizes criminalization as the default response to the problem of addiction and the vast majority of public resources are directed at arrest, prosecution, and incarceration of drug users – not treatment. And, as in the US, mass incarceration of drug users in Russia, under brutal conditions, produces a set of predictable adverse results for the individuals affected, and enables the continued spread of HIV throughout the general population.
An example of the dedication of Russian narcology to reinforcing its positions can be found in an official memorandum attacking methadone treatment – written and widely distributed by Ivanets and other prominent Russian narcologists. The memorandum urges that Russians say ""NO TO METHADONE PROGRAMS IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION"". For the authors of the memorandum, who include V. N. Krasnov Professor, Chair, Russian Society of Psychiatrists; N. N. Ivanets, Professor, Director, National Center on Addictions, Member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; and T. B. Dmitrieva, Professor, Deputy Chair of the Russian Society of Psychiatrists, ""The effective way to solve the problem of drug addiction treatment is an intensive search for and introduction of new methods and means that focus on complete cessation of drugs use by patients with addiction, their socialization into a new life style free from drugs, but not on exchanging from one drug to another."" While Russian drug users and their families wait for the coming of this millennium, HIV continues its march across Russia unabated.
The authors construct a xenophobic edifice that makes methadone appear as a plot against Russia. ""Foreign emissaries have increasingly raised the issue of introducing substitute therapy in the form of methadone programs for treatment of patients with heroin drug addiction"". By presenting themselves as having the moral authority to know what is best for drug addicts, and by representing their assertions as scientific facts, these experts regard substitution treatment as if it were an ""foreign enemy at the gate"". Particularly alarming is the fact the Dr. Dimitrieva, the memo's last author, is also a Member of the International Narcotics Control Board – the independent, ""quasi-judiciary"" body responsible for setting standards and policing compliance with international drug treaties at the United Nations. In this instance, judgment appears to have been rendered without evidence.
There have been many letters sent to the Russians from outside public health and medical officials and other experts including a report on the raft of evidence about methadone substitution, ""Say Yes to Methadone and Buprenorphine in the Russian Federation"" by Icro Maremmani and colleagues from the European Opiate Addiction treatment Association and its US counterpart (AATOD). In addition, international experts have prepared a report providing a point-by-point refutation of the memos' many errors of commission and omission. (attached in English and Russian). But these seem to fall on deaf ears in Russia.
If Russia is nearly alone in opposition to such therapies, this is seen as a point of nationalist pride. In stark contrast with other medical disciplines, narcology has not only stopped its progress, but has regressed towards what Mendelevich argues is a pseudo-science vis a vis assumptions about the nature of opioid dependence, characteristics of drug users, and the character of dependence and acceptable treatment. Mendelevich cites a 2003 appeal by ""Orthodox Doctors of Moscow"" that was entitled ""Stop Depravity,"" in which the authors representing the ""medical view"" of the Orthodox Russian Church demanded:
Methadone being a toxic drug with a significant euphoric effect can quickly cause severe addiction. Thus, not solving the problem of heroin addiction, it can become widely spread in the case that it is recommended as treatment. The program of methadone substitution therapy will generally become the first step to legalization of drugs in Russia, and we demand on not admitting its ratification by the Lower House of Russian Parliament.
[5,6]
As with the U.S., Russia's influence extends beyond its borders. Other republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU) adopt Russian narcology as their own model, or exist in uneasy tension with efforts to depart from the Russian model.
What is offered as drug addiction instead? Despite widespread opiate use and its direct association with increases in HIV incidence in Russia, detoxification or 'blood purification,' and psychotherapies geared to late stages of alcoholism are largely the only available narcological treatment option for opiate dependence.
This may be best illustrated with the example of codirrovanir or encoding, where patients undergo a hypnoid based therapy worthy of Rasputin. A series of misrepresentations, including a signed consent letter is witnessed by family members. Patients are manipulated into believing that if they drink during a prescribed period of time, they will die [7]. This approach is among the most prevalent form of psychotherapy practiced by Russian narcologists: one survey conducted among patients and their relatives indicates that coding accounted for up to 80% of methods offered as psychotherapy. There is a financial incentive to this approach: as Mendelevich notes, encoding is not included in Russian narcology's list of free medico-psychological curative-rehabilitative services, so patients must pay[5]
Limited access to current international research and travel opportunities for narcologists is a key element of the problem. In much of the former Soviet Union, narcologists who have come into the field since the emergence of injection drug use and HIV consistently report a lack of advanced educational and clinical training to meet the challenges they face. Some motivated narcologists have educated themselves beyond the 'received knowledge' available through night shift internships in a dispensary, and describe a growing dissatisfaction with the vertical relationship in which patients are regarded as bit players in their own recovery. A few narcologists might be characterized as early adopters – they use the internet to break their isolation, attend international meetings, and are initiating reforms within a narcological dispensary or outside in an NGO [8].
For the majority, however, emphasis on administrative duties and low salaries reduces incentives for narcologists to change their approach to that of a care giver. In the words of a Ukrainian physician who also works in Russia [8]:
The narcologist is not able or allowed to understand him or herself primarily as a caregiver or a caregiver at all. You get the position, two years after medical school, and then you withdraw from care; you understand that your way is to be in business for yourself where you get money for certifying people [as being free from drug use] or for detox medications. This is the main issue of the degradation of the doctor: when he is deprived of up-to-date education, when he is relegated to the status of bureaucrat policeman, and when his reaction to new ideas about treatments, rather than based on science, are based on rumor, like he is just a guy on the street. I feel myself standing not in a hospital or professional setting, even with the white coats, but in a bazaar.
Those narcologists who push back or are innovative are often seen as trouble makers and are vulnerable to rumors and scandal to invalidate their work. A recent essay in Lancet describes how a website Mendelevich set up to open up a ""scholarly debate"" on the use of methadone resulted in visits from prosecutors and state drug control for ""propagandizing of narcotics,"" and was requested to visit the Prosecutor's office. [9].
As a step toward critical examination of where the criminal framework obscures that of public health, HRJ is pleased to now publish Lev Levinson's report "" Half a Gram – A Thousand Lives"". Focusing on the weight of drugs confiscated from users and how these are mechanistically linked to criminal penalties, in a pattern similar to those employed in the US beginning with New York's Rockefeller Drug Laws in 1973, Levinson illuminates the larger question of why criminal penalties and social control have so overshadowed other approaches. Despite legal reforms hailed as steps forward because they reduced criminal penalties, Levinson
Notes that fundamental contradictions in what is considered evidence remain: mandatory sentences are determined by the weight of drugs seized from individuals – REGARDLESS OF PURITY. Thus a dealer with 2 grams of 80% pure heroin faces the same penalties as the user who has 2 grams of cut drug that's only 20% pure. As Levinson notes, ""...For acts not involving sale (acquisition, possession, transportation, production, or processing), the amount of the substance involved in the act is the sole determinant of whether the perpetrator is criminally prosecuted or is subject only to administrative punishment in the form of a fine of up to 1000 rubles or 15 days of detention.""
As is the case everywhere, most heroin addicts' lives in Russia are bound up with buying and selling illicit drugs, making them easy prey for arrests. They are then characterized as ""drug dealers"", and prosecuted accordingly. Levinson notes that ""According to the revision of article 2281 of the Criminal Code ... the sale of narcotics, like their production for purposes of distribution, is a criminal offense regardless of amount involved ... considered a felony and is punishable by incarceration for four to eight years"".
The new revisions to Russian law, Levinson notes, have ""become a survival issue for the Federal Service to Control Narcotics trafficking"", whose careers and personal fortunes are closely linked to keeping criminal pressure on addicts. Indeed, the federal drug control service issues glowing reports of its interdiction efforts each year to the international community, and no doubt will seek to have their successes reckoned as the world reflects on progress in the war on drugs. If past is prologue, unmentioned will be the ways in which these policies spell more infection and early death for drug users who remain at great risk not only for police abuses, but for blood-borne infections that have already claimed too many Russian lives.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 1949
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 by the United States, Canada, and several Western European nations to provide collective security against the Soviet Union.
Signing of the NATO Treaty
NATO was the first peacetime military alliance the United States entered into outside of the Western Hemisphere. After the destruction of the Second World War, the nations of Europe struggled to rebuild their economies and ensure their security. The former required a massive influx of aid to help the war-torn landscapes re-establish industries and produce food, and the latter required assurances against a resurgent Germany or incursions from the Soviet Union. The United States viewed an economically strong, rearmed, and integrated Europe as vital to the prevention of communist expansion across the continent. As a result, Secretary of State George Marshall proposed a program of large-scale economic aid to Europe. The resulting European Recovery Program, or Marshall Plan, not only facilitated European economic integration but promoted the idea of shared interests and cooperation between the United States and Europe. Soviet refusal either to participate in the Marshall Plan or to allow its satellite states in Eastern Europe to accept the economic assistance helped to reinforce the growing division between east and west in Europe.
In 1947–1948, a series of events caused the nations of Western Europe to become concerned about their physical and political security and the United States to become more closely involved with European affairs. The ongoing civil war in Greece, along with tensions in Turkey, led President Harry S. Truman to assert that the United States would provide economic and military aid to both countries, as well as to any other nation struggling against an attempt at subjugation. A Soviet-sponsored coup in Czechoslovakia resulted in a communist government coming to power on the borders of Germany. Attention also focused on elections in Italy as the communist party had made significant gains among Italian voters. Furthermore, events in Germany also caused concern. The occupation and governance of Germany after the war had long been disputed, and in mid-1948, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin chose to test Western resolve by implementing a blockade against West Berlin, which was then under joint U.S., British, and French control but surrounded by Soviet-controlled East Germany. This Berlin Crisis brought the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink of conflict, although a massive airlift to resupply the city for the duration of the blockade helped to prevent an outright confrontation. These events caused U.S. officials to grow increasingly wary of the possibility that the countries of Western Europe might deal with their security concerns by negotiating with the Soviets. To counter this possible turn of events, the Truman Administration considered the possibility of forming a European-American alliance that would commit the United States to bolstering the security of Western Europe.
Signing of the Brussels Treaty
The Western European countries were willing to consider a collective security solution. In response to increasing tensions and security concerns, representatives of several countries of Western Europe gathered together to create a military alliance. Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg signed the Brussels Treaty in March, 1948. Their treaty provided collective defense; if any one of these nations was attacked, the others were bound to help defend it. At the same time, the Truman Administration instituted a peacetime draft, increased military spending, and called upon the historically isolationist Republican Congress to consider a military alliance with Europe. In May of 1948, Republican Senator Arthur H. Vandenburg proposed a resolution suggesting that the President seek a security treaty with Western Europe that would adhere to the United Nations charter but exist outside of the Security Council where the Soviet Union held veto power. The Vandenburg Resolution passed, and negotiations began for the North Atlantic Treaty.
In spite of general agreement on the concept behind the treaty, it took several months to work out the exact terms. The U.S. Congress had embraced the pursuit of the international alliance, but it remained concerned about the wording of the treaty. The nations of Western Europe wanted assurances that the United States would intervene automatically in the event of an attack, but under the U.S. Constitution the power to declare war rested with Congress. Negotiations worked toward finding language that would reassure the European states but not obligate the United States to act in a way that violated its own laws. Additionally, European contributions to collective security would require large-scale military assistance from the United States to help rebuild Western Europe’s defense capabilities. While the European nations argued for individual grants and aid, the United States wanted to make aid conditional on regional coordination. A third issue was the question of scope. The Brussels Treaty signatories preferred that membership in the alliance be restricted to the members of that treaty plus the United States. The U.S. negotiators felt there was more to be gained from enlarging the new treaty to include the countries of the North Atlantic, including Canada, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, and Portugal. Together, these countries held territory that formed a bridge between the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which would facilitate military action if it became necessary.
President Truman inspecting a tank produced under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program
The result of these extensive negotiations was the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. In this agreement, the United States, Canada, Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United Kingdom agreed to consider attack against one an attack against all, along with consultations about threats and defense matters. This collective defense arrangement only formally applied to attacks against the signatories that occurred in Europe or North America; it did not include conflicts in colonial territories. After the treaty was signed, a number of the signatories made requests to the United States for military aid. Later in 1949, President Truman proposed a military assistance program, and the Mutual Defense Assistance Program passed the U.S. Congress in October, appropriating some $1.4 billion dollars for the purpose of building Western European defenses.
Soon after the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the outbreak of the Korean War led the members to move quickly to integrate and coordinate their defense forces through a centralized headquarters. The North Korean attack on South Korea was widely viewed at the time to be an example of communist aggression directed by Moscow, so the United States bolstered its troop commitments to Europe to provide assurances against Soviet aggression on the European continent. In 1952, the members agreed to admit Greece and Turkey to NATO and added the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955. West German entry led the Soviet Union to retaliate with its own regional alliance, which took the form of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and included the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe as members.
The collective defense arrangements in NATO served to place the whole of Western Europe under the American “nuclear umbrella.” In the 1950s, one of the first military doctrines of NATO emerged in the form of “massive retaliation,” or the idea that if any member was attacked, the United States would respond with a large-scale nuclear attack. The threat of this form of response was meant to serve as a deterrent against Soviet aggression on the continent. Although formed in response to the exigencies of the developing Cold War, NATO has lasted beyond the end of that conflict, with membership even expanding to include some former Soviet states. It remains the largest peacetime military alliance in the world.

Abstract
The first large-scale use of a traditional weapon of mass destruction (chemical, biological, or nuclear) involved the successful deployment of chemical weapons during World War I (1914–1918). Historians now refer to the Great War as the chemist’s war because of the scientific and engineering mobilization efforts by the major belligerents. The development, production, and deployment of war gases such as chlorine, phosgene, and mustard created a new and complex public health threat that endangered not only soldiers and civilians on the battlefield but also chemical workers on the home front involved in the large-scale manufacturing processes. The story of chemical weapons research and development during that war provides useful insights for current public health practitioners faced with a possible chemical weapons attack against civilian or military populations.
IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF April 22, 1915, members of a special unit of the German Army opened the valves on more than 6000 steel cylinders arrayed in trenches along their defensive perimeter at Ypres, Belgium. Within 10 minutes, 160 tons of chlorine gas drifted over the opposing French trenches, engulfing all those downwind. Filled with pressurized liquid chlorine, the cylinders had been clandestinely installed by the Germans more than 3 weeks earlier. The order to release the gas was entrusted to German military meteorologists, who had carefully studied the area’s prevailing wind patterns. Disregarding intelligence reports about the strange cylinders prior to the attack, the French troops were totally unprepared for this new and horrifying weapon.1
The surprise use of chlorine gas allowed the Germans to rupture the French line along a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) front, causing terror and forcing a panicked and chaotic retreat. Within a matter of minutes, this slow moving wall of gas killed more than 1000 French and Algerian soldiers, while wounding approximately 4000 more.2 A British soldier described the pandemonium that flowed from the front lines to the rear.
[I watched] figures running wildly in confusion over the fields. Greenish-gray clouds swept down upon them, turning yellow as they traveled over the country blasting everything they touched and shriveling up the vegetation. . . . Then there staggered into our midst French soldiers, blinded, coughing, chests heaving, faces an ugly purple color, lips speechless with agony, and behind them in the gas soaked trenches, we learned that they had left hundreds of dead and dying comrades.3
The German High Command sanctioned the use of gas in the hope that this new weapon would bring a decisive victory, breaking the enduring stalemate of trench warfare. However, their faith in this wonder weapon was limited. Surprised by the apparent success of the attack, and having no plan to send a large offensive force in after the gas, the Germans were unable to take advantage of the situation. Within days, both armies once again faced each other from the same opposing fortifications. The attack that spring day, nonetheless, marked a turning point in military history, as it is recognized as the first successful use of lethal chemical weapons on the battlefield.
Here, I offer a window into the first weapon of mass destruction (WMD) by charting the development and use of gas warfare during World War I. Defined today as “man-made, supertoxic chemicals that can be dispersed as a gas, vapor, liquid, aerosol (a suspension of microscopic droplets), or adsorbed onto a fine talcum-like powder to create ‘dusty’ agents,” chemical weapons remain a viable public health threat for civilians and soldiers across the globe.4 If, in the world since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the threat of terror weapons seems a ubiquitous part of the daily news and the term WMD is now as familiar to soccer moms as to beltway defense planners, it is important to remember that the medical and public health consequences of chemical weapons use are as real today as they were in 1915.5
Although chemical weapons killed proportionally few soldiers in World War I (1914–1918), the psychological damage from “gas fright” and the exposure of large numbers of soldiers, munitions workers, and civilians to chemical agents had significant public health consequences. Understanding the origins of chemical warfare during World War I and its emergence during that conflict as a physical and psychological threat to both military and civilian populations can provide historical insight into possible contemporary medical responses to this enduring and technologically pervasive threat.

THE MILITARIZATION OF ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY
World War I had numerous causes, including colonial competition, economic rivalry, and various ideological and cultural clashes among the rising nation states of Europe. A complex and binding system of alliances among the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey) and the Allied Powers (Britain, France, Russia, and beginning in 1917, the United States) placed peace in a delicate balance. The tipping point came on June 28, 1914, with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian national. This single act set off a chain of events that quickly plunged the world into a global war that eventually claimed between 9 million and 10 million lives and lasted 4 years.6
The economic and industrial forces that altered the face of Europe during the first decade of the 20th century were also instrumental in creating many of the technological innovations driving the war. In time, tanks, submarines, and aircraft revolutionized how World War I was waged on land, sea, and in the air. Chemical weapons were another new marvel of the war, and their successful research, development, and deployment reflected the increasing sophistication of scientific and engineering practice. At the same time, physicians and medical researchers (some of whom worked to create these weapons) struggled to create adequate defensive systems and medical procedures to limit casualties. By the time of the armistice on November 11, 1918, the use of chemical weapons such as chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas had resulted in more than 1.3 million casualties and approximately 90 000 deaths (Table 1 ▶).

Although one could argue that primitive forms of chemical weapons were used in earlier conflicts, it was not until the 20th century that scientists, engineers, and physicians could predictably and consistently produce these weapons to inflict mass casualties.7 At the close of the 19th century, the various European powers became troubled by the potentiality of chemical weapons and began holding conferences and writing various treaties to limit or curtail the development and deployment of this new technology. Suspicion and self-interest among both allies and rivals generally limited the usefulness of these activities, an unfortunate political reality that continues to the present day. For instance, the Hague Declaration of 1899 and the Hague Convention of 1907 forbade the use of “poison or poisonous weapons” in warfare, yet more than 124 000 tons of gas were produced by the end of World War I.8
The development of these war gases, like many of the other new weapons systems created during this period, depended on the work of academic and industrial scientists who increasingly served the military needs of the state. Germany, arguably the world’s leader in science at the time, and without question the guiding force in academic and industrial chemistry, moved decisively in the research and production of chemical agents once the war began. Fritz Haber, a prominent German chemist and future Nobel laureate, led the German program.9 Haber, the so-called “father of chemical weapons,” moved enthusiastically between the front and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in Berlin. As he organized and led the German chemical warfare program, solving ongoing problems in chemical agent development and deployment, his activities anticipated a troubling pattern of behavior among future generations of scientists, engineers, and physicians.
The Germans’ first use of gas mirrored their initial emphasis on the offensive aspects of chemical weapons research and their belief that a technological fix would bring a decisive victory.10 Those on the receiving end, France and Great Britain, moved first on the defensive aspects of these new weapons. By war’s end, however, the national programs among the warring nations focused on both the offensive and defensive aspect of chemical weapons. These programs were often a result of the complete mobilization of their nations’ academic, industrial, and economic resources for war.
The expansion of research brought in an array of specialists from chemistry, physics, and engineering and, increasingly, from medicine, biology, and physiology, further blurring ethical demarcations in medical research. Throughout the war, the British armed forces enlisted scientists in many academic institutions—including Oxford, Cambridge, University College London, the Army Medical College at Millbrook, and the Lister Institute—to work on both aspects of gas warfare. The French government took a more direct approach to chemical weapons research by militarizing the chemistry, pathology, and physiology departments of 16 leading medical schools and institutes. Additionally, it essentially absorbed the University of Paris in order to direct, coordinate, and research all aspects of chemical warfare.11
Research conducted by Allied scientists on the nature of chemical warfare, and the observations and experience of their combat troops was employed by the United States with varying degrees of success when it joined the Allies. The United States had adopted a policy of formal neutrality at the beginning of the war, although ongoing Atlantic trade benefited the Allied cause. American sympathies for Britain, France, and other allies grew during the course of the war, aided both by the deadlock on the battlefield and the increasing menace of unrestricted submarine warfare by German U-boats. In 1917, a marked increase in U-boat attacks on commercial shipping, in addition to a potential German alliance with Mexico, led to a formal declaration of war on April 6, 1917.
The American response to chemical warfare is indicative of the growing sophistication of academic, industrial, and military research and development capabilities in the United States at a time when linkages between the federal government and science were becoming more pronounced.12 As the war intensified, increasing anxiety about possible entry into the conflict and the overall lack of military preparation prompted some in government, industry, and academe to begin planning. The origins of an organized program for chemical warfare in Washington came first from the civilian sector. On February 8, 1917, Van H. Manning, the director of the Bureau of Mines, offered the technical services of his agency to the Military Committee of the National Research Council. The familiarity of the bureau with research involving noxious gases, breathing apparatus, explosives, and gas detection technologies seemed well suited for the task.13
On the same day as the American declaration of war, the National Research Council subcommittee on noxious gases was appointed to “carry on investigations into noxious gases, generation, antidote for same, for war purposes.”14 Within one year, research was under way at a number of prestigious universities and medical schools, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins, Harvard, and Yale, in addition to some of the country’s leading industrial firms.15 The chemical warfare program was directed out of offices and laboratories at American University in Washington, DC. During the course of the war, research programs involving
gas investigations; defense problems; medical science problems; chemical research; gas mask research; pyrotechnic research; small-scale manufacturing; mechanical research; pharmacological research; [and] administration were carried out in Washington and across the country.16
Research began as the first US troops made preparations for combat. Fear of gas attacks against these members of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) embarking for the European front initially focused research in the United States on defensive measures, with priority given to gas mask design and production.
As the American war effort intensified, research expanded to include offensive weapons, resulting in numerous discoveries, including the creation of one of the conflict’s only new chemical weapons, an arsenic-based agent similar to mustard gas called lewisite (β-chlorovinyldichloroarsine). Synthesized in his laboratory by Wilfred Lee Lewis, this deadly substance was soon mass-produced by the military under the direction of chemist and future Harvard president James. B. Conant.17 By July 1918, research and development on agents such as lewisite passed from civilian to military control as the entire chemical weapons program moved from the Bureau of Mines to the army’s newly organized Chemical Warfare Service.
At that time, chemical warfare research in the United States involved more than 1900 scientists and technicians, making it at that time the largest government research program in American history.18 By the time the war ended, historians estimate that more than 5500 university-trained scientists and technicians and tens of thousands of industrial workers on both sides of the battle lines worked on chemical weapons.19 Both the military use and industrial production of chemical weapons presented a number of health risks.

GAS MASKS AND THE EVOLUTION OF GAS DEFENSE
As the war progressed, the knowledge gained by British, French, and German military planners and scientists on the nature of gas warfare quickly evolved into a kind of technological chess match. New offensive threats were met by an evolving array of defensive countermeasures. Overall, the deployment of chemical weapons met with mixed results as the tactics, strategy, and military culture of all of the armies continually struggled to adjust to this new weapon. Aside from tactical and strategic consequences, chemical weapons heralded larger cultural changes for combatant and observer alike. In perhaps his most celebrated poem, “Dulce et Decorum Est,” British soldier Wilfred Owen captured in verse the horrors of this new form of warfare, a horror that he had witnessed first hand at the front.
Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling, Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling, And flound’ring like a man on fire or lime . . .
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, As under a green sea, I saw him drowning . . . 20
The types of gas attacks Owen witnessed prior to his own death in 1918 were quite different in kind than those experienced by troops stationed at the front during the first years of the war.
Chemical warfare had begun in a tentative way before Ypres with the French use of tear gas grenades in 1914 and early 1915. Similarly, the British began developing a range of nonlethal chemical weapons meant to harass enemy troops. The Germans started experimental work on chemical agents in late 1914 at the suggestion of University of Berlin chemist and Nobel laureate Walther Nernst.21 This early research quickly produced an effective tear gas artillery shell. Although the Germans fared no better than the French with tear gas as a debilitating agent, German chemists, now with a formal program led by Fritz Haber, continued to work on the chemical weapons problem. By 1915, scientists at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute had developed an effective chlorine gas weapon. By placing chlorine into specially designed cylinders, chlorine gas could be discharged in a dense cloud that eventually settled into enemy trenches. Interestingly, the German High Command envisioned gas as an effective tool to draw soldiers out of their trenches so as to kill or wound them with conventional weapons rather than as a lethal weapon.22
As an offensive response to chlorine, both the French and the British quickly developed “annoyer” grenades, but these chemical weapons were not lethal and few even made it onto the battlefield. By mid-1915, both sides regularly used cylinders to deploy chlorine gas, and by mid-1916 both sides mixed chlorine and phosgene in an attempt to create larger numbers of casualties.23 By the end of the war, most belligerents employed a variety of chemical agents in combat, including chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas (Table 1 ▶).
The Germans’ offensive use of chlorine led one British soldier to remark that it “was the most fiendish, wicked thing I have ever seen.”24 In a more graphic description, British Sergeant Elmer W. Cotton vividly remembered the suffering of gassed soldiers. He wrote in his diary that men were
propped up against a wall . . . —all gassed—their color was black, green & blue, tongues hanging out & eyes staring—one or two were dead and others beyond human aid, some were coughing up green froth from their lungs.25
This type of suffering moved the British and the French to quickly develop some type of protection from chlorine gas. The British promptly developed a primitive gas mask that a soldier described as “piece of muslin, which we tied round the nose and mouth and around the backs of our heads,” but these were largely ineffective.26 Once chlorine was identified as the chemical agent, a thiosulfatelaced cotton pad effectively neutralized the gas.27
By July 1915, the British medical corps devised a wool hood soaked in thiosulfate, sodium bicarbonate, and glycerin. This “hypo helmet,” a hood that fully enclosed a soldier’s head, had a mica window so soldiers could see.28 Although these early masks were better than nothing, soldiers found them difficult to put on, uncomfortable, and easily damaged, thus limiting their efficacy.29 The development of the small box respirator by the British in 1916 provided effective protection from most chemical agents used throughout the war because it could be modified to neutralize new agents, such as mustard gas.
The gas mask drill—the donning of all protective gear as rapidly as possible under the most difficult conditions—became an integral part of life in the trenches and in preparing recruits for battle. As with the rifle drill that anchors infantry training, the discipline and skills needed to quickly and effectively don protective gear became a necessary part of life for all at the front. Soldiers were instructed always to have their mask handy, no matter where they were or what they were doing. Responding to the sound of a specific whistle, clanging alarm bell, or shout, soldiers would move with all due speed to put on their masks or hoods. Far from embracing gas masks as a life-saving technology, soldiers felt emasculated and claustrophobic in them. As one British officer explained,
We gaze[d] at one another like goggle-eyed, imbecile frogs. The mask makes you feel only half a man. The air you breathe has been filtered of all save a few chemical substances. A man doesn’t live on what passes through the filter—he merely exists. He gets the mentality of a wide-awake vegetable.30
According to British infantryman Albert Marshal, “By the second second lot we’d got gas masks which came right over your head. They were terribly hot and awful, but still, they stopped the gas.”31
There was also no guarantee that gas masks would work. Although British and German masks were fairly reliable because of strict quality control measures, the French masks were notoriously unreliable. Moreover, treating wounded soldiers became even more difficult when both stretcher-bearers and injured men needed to don masks, and in some cases the masks caused more trauma to victims.32 The dangers at the front affected all those that lived and labored there. Besides affecting military populations, gas clouds caused civilian casualties because the wind often blew through villages and towns close to the front. Unlike soldiers, civilians did not necessarily have access to gas masks or the training to make sure the masks were used properly. Although the official number of civilian casualties was about 5200, the numbers were undoubtedly much higher.33 The probability of gas attack was so frequent that in time researchers on both sides even devised masks for horses, dogs, and messenger pigeons involved in military operations.34
As the Americans watched the war in Europe, they realized as early as 1915 that gas masks were an important defensive measure for their troops. The Board of Ordnance and Fortifications of the War Department stressed the importance of developing masks before the United States entered the war. In a November 5, 1915, meeting they decided that “Certain practices in the present European war have indicated the necessity for providing some equipment of this kind. . . . The design and supply should not be left unassigned and should be assigned to the Medical Department.”35
Within a month of the US entry into the conflict, the secretary of war ordered the surgeon general to supply 1 000 000 gas masks, 8500 “chemical sprayer[s] for cleaning trenches,” and 1000 “oxygen apparatus for resuscitating [the] wounded” by June 30, 1918.36 As the summer of 1917 progressed, it became evident that unlike the other purely laboratory-based research programs, the complexity and scale of gas mask manufacture (a new and complex industrial endeavor) required a separate institutional structure within the new chemical warfare research apparatus. On August 31, 1917, the Gas Defense Service (later known as the Gas Defense Division) was formally organized within the Army Medical Department under the auspices of the Office of the Surgeon General to carry out gas mask research and manufacture.37 Even with the nation’s elaborate institutional and research commitment to gas masks, masks had their limits and could not ward off the fear of being gassed.
By late 1915, gas warfare had become a psychological as well as physical weapon. Much as hellish multiday artillery barrages resulted in mental breakdowns associated with “shellshock,” the constant threat of exposure to even a single gas shell added to the already unbearable stress of life at the front. The fear of being gassed, along with periodic harassing gas attacks, kept soldiers on both fronts on edge and could lead to anomie, gas fright, and in some cases mental breakdowns. Soldiers on all sides felt that gas warfare was not a proper weapon and went beyond the bounds of humanity.38 H. Allen, who served at the front, described the psychological effects of nightly gas threats:
With men trained to believe that a light sniff of gas might mean death, and with nerves highly strung by being shelled for long periods and with the presence of not a few who really had been gassed, it is no wonder that the gas alarm went beyond all bounds. . . . Gas horns would be honked, empty brass shell-casings beaten, rifles emptied and the mad cry would be taken up. . . . For miles around, scared soldiers woke up in the midst of frightful pandemonium and put on their masks, only to hear a few minutes later the cry of “All safe.” . . . Two or three alarms a night were common. Gas shock was as frequent as shellshock.39
The psychological consequences of gas attacks were not limited to fear of the air that soldiers breathed. A 1918 US Army “afteraction report” described an incident in which a platoon of machine gunners became convinced that their food was contaminated in a gas attack. When a shell exploded near the men while they ate, a soldier remembered:
[S]omeone yelled “GAS!” and said their food had been gassed. All the men were seized with gas fright and a few minutes later made their way to the Aid Station. . . . They came in in stooping posture, holding their abdomens and complaining of pains in the stomach, while their faces bore anxious, frightened expressions and some had even vomited.40
After being given bicarbonate of soda to settle their stomachs, a rest, and reassurances that they were not gassed, the men returned to the front. Because both gas fright and gas attacks became more severe in 1917 and 1918, doctors and medics found it difficult to diagnose real as opposed to imagined gas attacks. For the most part, all the medical corps could do for gas casualties was prescribe bed rest and wait for symptoms to emerge. Medical units quickly shipped soldiers without obvious physical symptoms of gas exposure back to the front. Moreover, soldiers never knew if their gas mask would leak or if their filter would run out, which caused even more anxiety as belligerents used more caustic agents.41 The Allied efforts to contain the effects of chlorine and phosgene briefly stabilized the technological balance through the first half of the war. The German introduction of mustard gas would destroy this balance and elevate the violence and terror of chemical warfare to a new level.

MUSTARD, THE “KING OF BATTLE GASES”
By the spring of 1917, the defensive measures employed by the Allied armies to contain the German gas threat were increasingly successful, as least with respect to limiting fatalities. Surprisingly, such defensive success came as the offensive deployment of gas weapons became increasingly sophisticated. Since 1915, the integration of ongoing field and laboratory studies involving agent stability, meteorological conditions, and weapons design made the tactical planning involved in delivering gas to specific targets much more reliable.42 There were limits, though, to the destructive range of certain chemical weapons. Both sides now recognized that although a regular gas attack involving either chlorine or phosgene (under optimum conditions) could produce large numbers of casualties, such an attack usually resulted in relatively few fatalities if troops were properly prepared and outfitted.
In a bloody war of attrition, however, the ability to wound instead of kill had definite tactical and strategic value. The continual removal of large numbers of battle-ready troops from forward areas, even for short periods, severely compromised the ability of armies to conduct successful operations. Because of the respiratory damage both chlorine and phosgene caused, soldiers required a long convalescence before returning to combat. The average number of days an AEF gas victim spent recovering and away from the front was 60 days for chlorine and 45.5 days for phosgene.43 Although such losses certainly impeded the war effort, by the spring of 1917 the overall military effectiveness of gas attacks seemed to be diminishing. This would soon change.
In July 1917, aware of the loss of their technological superiority and perhaps their ability to win the war, the Germans deployed a new and more troublesome chemical agent: mustard gas. Although mustard was introduced late in the war, it became known as the “King of Battle Gases” because it eventually caused more chemical casualties than all the other agents combined, including chlorine, phosgene, and cyanogen chloride. Harry L. Gilchrist, medical director of the Gas Service, US Army Expeditionary Force, described the first mustard causalities:
At first the troops didn’t notice the gas and were not uncomfortable, but in the course of an hour or so, there was marked inflammation of their eyes. They vomited, and there was erythema of the skin. . . . Later there was severe blistering of the skin, especially where the uniform had been contaminated, and by the time the gassed cases reached the casualty clearing station, the men were virtually blind and had to be led about, each man holding on to the man in front with an orderly in the lead.44
Unlike the lung irritants chlorine and phosgene, mustard gas was a vesicant (similar to lewisite) that produced large blisters on any area of contact. Particularly severe blisters emerged when uniforms were soaked in mustard gas. If exposure was high enough, mustard gas could cause permanent eye damage, but this was infrequent.45 The complexity of treatment required in mustard injuries involved a new level of aid and medical care.
Caring for mustard victims differed from caring for chlorine or phosgene casualties. Once evacuated, chlorine and phosgene victims received oxygen and bed rest until they were healthy enough to return to the front. However, soldiers exposed to mustard gas, especially in high concentrations or for long periods of time, needed to bathe with hot soap and water to remove the chemical from their skin. If it was not scrubbed off within 30 minutes of exposure, blistering occurred. Portable shower units with specially trained medics helped minimize its blistering effect. These consisted of a “bath truck [that was] provided with [a] hot water boiler and a number of fold-down shower heads.”46
After the troops showered, the chemical corps issued them new uniforms in exchange for their contaminated clothing. These discarded clothes were then decontaminated and reissued to other exposed soldiers. Because mustard gas induced eye injuries, casualties had their eyes washed as quickly as possible to minimize the duration of acute conjunctivitis, which generally lasted several weeks. Soldiers’ care became increasingly difficult in the last year of the war with the increased frequency of gas attacks. Also, mustard gas damaged the lungs more severely than either chlorine or phosgene did, and these lesions were much more difficult to treat.47 The recuperation time from mustard gas exposure—46 days—was similar to that of phosgene.48
Mustard gas was a particular problem for both sides because after it was released it settled in an area, contaminating it. The vesicant often recontaminated soldiers and horses in contaminated, unquarantined areas. Cecil Withers, a British soldier, remembered being exposed to mustard gas during a mortar attack:
I suffer badly from phlegm and from coughs and colds a lot. That all started when the British were shelling hard at the last Battle of the Somme. One of the shells disturbed the residue of mustard gas that had been lying there for months. They talk about secondary smoking . . . I got secondary gas.49
In addition, because mustard gas was heavier than air or water, it settled in ditches or at the bottom of trenches and puddles and created a persistent environmental hazard for troops, civilians, and animals alike. All a soldier needed to do was disturb the dirt, mud, or water and he would suffer from gas exposure. Persistency was a problem not only on the battlefield but also for the medical corps. Because of the volatility of mustard gas, a single gassed soldier could contaminate medical personnel, the ambulance, and other patients. The medical corps created a special evacuation system to minimize this type of contamination once large quantities of mustard gas were used in combat.50
Although new to gas warfare, the United States moved quickly and used mustard gas offensively in June 1918, when US mustard gas production was 30 tons per day. Lewisite, which might have replaced mustard gas had the war continued into the winter of 1919, was a “superior” weapon that caused instantaneous blistering, was lethal in minute quantities, was relatively difficult to detect, and perhaps more importantly, had a molecular structure that allowed rapid dissipation. This last factor allowed attacking forces to move into enemy territory without fear of contamination and injury.51
The bloody toll of mustard gas by war’s end is indicative of its usefulness as an offensive weapon. Although approximately 30% of all war casualties were victims of gas exposure, more than 80% of the approximately 186 000 British chemical casualties were caused by mustard gas alone, with a death toll of approximately 2.6%. This extremely large number of casualties among well-trained and equipped British troops indicates the destructiveness mustard caused on the battlefield. AEF combat losses included more than 52 800 battlefield fatalities, with approximately 1500 dying of gas-related injuries.52 Unfortunately, death and injury caused by chemical agents were not restricted to the battlefield.

INDUSTRIAL WORKERS COPE WITH CHEMICAL AGENTS
The scale of industrial chemical production during the course of the war was enormous and without precedent. Chemical companies, universities, and government laboratories from all the warring nations labored at great cost to produce chemicals not only for traditional war materiel such as munitions and fuel but also for a new generation of weapons. The production of certain chemical weapons was complex and often involved the synthesis of various chemical precursors needed for the completion of a specific chemical agent. Estimates by historians and military officials place production in excess of 124200 tons of gas, indicating a substantial investment on the part of various governments and chemical manufacturers to meet expansive wartime production schedules.53 While thoughts of gas warfare usually bring to mind images of the battlefield, the risks and sacrifices workers made in their home countries to manufacture war gases was no less valuable and in many ways presented just as many, if not more, health risks.
Germany, then the world’s leading chemical manufacturer, produced numerous gas warfare munitions during the course of the war, including more than 33 million pounds of gas shells. The German firm Badische Aniline & Soda Fabrik produced the largest quantity of phosgene over the course of the war. The company’s ready access to carbon monoxide from its ammonia plant facilitated the manufacture of approximately 7200 tons of phosgene per year. Although Germany out-produced the Allies in phosgene production, the French, British, and Americans all made phosgene using a variety of techniques.54 By 1916, the Germans deployed diphosgene in artillery shells at Verdun. It superseded phosgene in German attacks largely because the diphosgene shells could be assembled in the field rather than in distant factories.55
Although postwar investigations on the state of the chemical industry during the war invariably gave Germany high marks overall for worker safety, a report by Lt Col James F. Norris of the US Army Chemical Warfare Service on the Bayer Company’s diphosgene (perchloromethylformate) facility at Höchst noted that German factory men were frequently poisoned by gas and that as many as one third were absent from the factory at any given time because of gas-related illnesses. Norris also suspected that several men died from gas exposure at the Höchst plant, but there was no conclusive proof of the linkage between working in the plant and the men’s deaths.56 Superior plant organization and design, however, reduced the risk to some German workers, as did their choice of production method, most importantly for mustard gas.57
The British and French had more difficulty manufacturing chemical agents, especially once they started producing mustard gas. Because the Allies used the more dangerous Guthrie’s process, industrial mustard production necessitated extra care and state-of-the-art facilities. Historian Ludwig Haber noted that safe production required “the tiled construction and plumbing construction of a municipal washhouse, the ventilation system of an up-to-date coal mine, and the nursing facilities of a CCS [casualty clearing station] in a quiet sector of the front.”58 Because of the use of smaller and older plants, British and French facilities often employed primitive open vats and substandard piping. Particularly dangerous jobs included cleaning the pipes, which inevitably became blocked during production, as well as repairing pumps and charging drums to prepare them for transporting various toxic and corrosive liquids. These industrial conditions produced the same injuries in civilians as they did in soldiers, leading to high rates of absenteeism and eventually to a rotational schedule that allowed workers to have a week off for every 20 days in the plant.
The effects were even more severe for mustard plant workers: “[W]hatever was touched inflamed and whatever was breathed irritated.”59 Factory workers suffered from chronic mustard gas poisoning because of long-term exposure; symptoms included “listlessness, ‘nervous debility’ . . . headaches, indigestion, spasms of the eyelids, breathlessness, and inability to do a full days work.”60 Industrial workers suffered from frequent cases of bronchitis, asthma, throat and lung infections, chest and heart problems, and depression or other recurring but vague ailments.61 Many gassed soldiers and factory workers found it difficult to work after the war because of frequent illness and difficulty breathing.
The most dangerous job regardless of location involved filling artillery gas shells. This produced even more injuries than normal chemical production, and German workers suffered as much as British, French, and American workers.62 Thousands of workers at British loading facilities were adversely affected; at one facility, one worker in nine became ill or was injured, and at another the rate reached 100% of the labor force.63 These types of recurring injuries among British laborers prompted changes in the approach of government and military planners to the problem of plant design and worker safety. One of the most significant responses was the Trench Warfare Supply Department’s appointment of F. Shuffelbotham as acting medical supervisor in charge of all British gas facilities in July 1916.
Following the British model, the Americans adopted a more rigorous medical inspection program to facilitate worker safety. Even before industrial production began, the Bureau of Mines in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was charged with instituting such a program. As large-scale production facilities came on line, the surgeon general’s office took over responsibility for workers (Figure 1 ▶). They contracted with local physicians “whose duty it was to hold sick call, give physical examinations at regular intervals, examine applicants for work in the gas plant, and to be available for emergency calls at all hours.”64

By the end of the war, the production infrastructure, including federal facilities such as the Edgewood Arsenal in rural Maryland, employed more than 10000 men and women. In addition to Edgewood, 9 other gas facilities produced over 140 tons of gas per day, “an amount greater than the production of Germany, Great Britain, and France combined.”65 Such mass production quotas, however, were not without risk. An analysis of a single seven-month period at Edgewood revealed 925 casualties and three fatalities, with more than 75 injuries traced directly to mustard gas production.66 For many soldiers and workers, the long-term health consequences of gas exposure were lifelong. As veteran Albert Marshal noted:
[T]he gas is still with me today. It makes me itch every morning and at six every night. You can see my skin all dry. Tonight, my arm will itch from the top to the elbow. And so will the back of my neck. It feels like a needle pricking you. And that’s from ninety years ago.67
Go to:
IN THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT WAR
Although memories of the Great War have now receded into the past, chemical warfare has remained surprisingly resilient over time. Between the 1918 armistice and 1933, several international conferences were held to try to limit or abolish chemical weapons; these included the Washington Conference (1921–1922), the Geneva Conference (1923–1925), and the World Disarmament Conference (1933). Although progress was made toward outlawing the use of “asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases” per the Geneva Protocol of 1925, programs and research continued throughout the interwar period and most of the rest of the century, despite the public’s rejection of these weapons.68
Although condemned, chemical weapons continued to be used during the interwar years, largely against civilians in colonial possessions. The most notable was the Italian government’s aerial spraying and bombing of Ethiopian soldiers and civilians during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. The Spanish also used chemical weapons in Morocco, the British in Russia and Iraq, and the Japanese in China, respectively. With the Japanese expansion into China and the rise of National Socialism in Germany in the 1930s, most countries, including the United States, refused to eliminate chemical weapons as a strategic weapon, although all major combatants dramatically scaled back their programs. The difficulties in regulating chemical weapons are perhaps best illustrated by the actions of the United States. Although the United States was a signatory of the Geneva Protocol on June 17, 1925, formal ratification by the US Senate did not come until April 10, 1975, almost 50 years later.
This political ambivalence was reflective of the ongoing debates about chemical weapons research and production that waxed and waned in the United States over the rest of the century. During World War II, for instance, the US military was vocal about its avoidance of the deployment or use of poison gas. At the same time, however, chemical weapons were a mainstay of the Army Air Corps strategic bombing campaigns in both the European and Pacific theaters.69 In less than 3 years, more than 220 000 tons of chemically based munitions such as napalm and magnesium were dropped on civilian targets in both Germany and Japan, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians. The air campaigns in World War II also reflect the disturbing shift in the rise of civilian casualties during war from all types of weapons, a trend that has increased steadily from the 1930s until the present day.70
The commitment to a host of long-term and large-scale military research programs during the Cold War, involving numerous weapons systems, provided an institutional and financial impetus for work on a variety of chemical weapons. In an effort to secure their position as global superpowers throughout the Cold War, the United States, the Soviet Union, and their various North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Warsaw Pact allies developed new chemical weapons programs based in part on German nerve agents like sarin. To expedite their search for new agents, the United States, Canada, and Britain entered a Tripartite Agreement as early as 1946 to share research on offensive and defensive aspects of chemical weapons. Many chemical weapons research programs (such as the US program) often worked in tandem with nominally smaller but no less sophisticated biological weapons programs, which added a wealth of data on complex meteorological and delivery system problems. Over time, the increasing sophistication of mainstream chemical and biological weapons in the early postwar period led to the development of new generations of nerve agents.71
By the mid-1950s, the United States was searching for more powerful nerve agents; these efforts culminated in the development of VX, which was 3 times as lethal as sarin and had the additional tactical utility of battlefield persistence. The United States continued to develop traditional chemical (and nerve) weapons well into the late 1960s. At that time, changes in national security policy, coupled with the ongoing military situation in Vietnam, saw a shift toward partial disarmament of some types of WMDs with a simultaneous expansion of research and development programs for new weapons.
This schizophrenic policy continued into the1980s, culminating in the creation of a new generation of so called “binary” chemical weapons. Binary weapons, which used relatively harmless precursors that chemically combined within a warhead at a designated target, produced various toxic agents capable of large numbers of mass casualties. The promise of binary weapons came at a time of increasing political pressures about the dangers of large-scale chemical warfare.
By the late 1980s, in response to pressure from the Soviet Union and various NATO allies, the United States began the wholesale destruction of much of its chemical weapons stockpile (at places such as the army arsenal at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and the Johnson Atoll in the South Pacific) in an effort to disarm, as well as destroy older weapons that had become unstable. Research continued in the United States on various chemical weapons systems through the 1990s and on into the new millennium. At present, the United States maintains a large and sophisticated arsenal of chemical and nerve agents for tactical and strategic use.72
The future of these weapons may best be understood by returning to 2 scientists who had firsthand knowledge of their development and use during World War I.73 Their thoughts both at the time and years later may best encapsulate the contested nature of chemical warfare during the last century. Writing in the late 1960s, chemist James Conant, who directed US lewisite production during World War I, expressed moral ambivalence about poison gas, comparing it to weapons systems in general:
To me, the development of new and more gases seemed no more immoral that the manufacture of explosives and guns. . . . I did not see in 1917 . . . why tearing a man’s guts out by high explosive shell is to be preferred to maiming him by attacking his lungs or skin. All war is immoral.74
Otto Hahn, a future Nobel laureate in chemistry, was recruited by his colleague Fritz Haber to the German chemical weapons program. Hahn went to the eastern front to see for himself the capabilities of this new weapon. The experience left him profoundly shaken:
I was very ashamed and deeply agitated. First we attacked the Russian soldiers with our gas, and then, when we saw the poor chaps lying on the ground and slowing dying, we restored their breathing with our self-rescue equipment. The total insanity of war became obvious to us. First one attempts to eliminate the unknown enemy in his trench, but when one comes face to face with him, one cannot bear it and sets about helping him. Yet often we could no longer save the poor victims.75
Whether or not the pragmatic views of Conant were correct, the “insanity of war” remained a constant for the rest of the 20th century, even as the political means and technological methods to carry out war continued to evolve. In the years since the end of the Cold War, the continued evolution of warfare, coupled with rapid developments in globalization, has made the threat of chemical warfare more immediate. The increased availability of various industrial chemicals, coupled with the expansion of asymmetrical warfare and terrorism, presents us with an uncertain future. During 2007, chemical weapons were used in Iraq against both civilian populations and American and British occupation forces. The detonation of either small chemical bombs or large chlorine tanker trucks (with the aid of explosives) in densely populated urban areas such as Fallujah and Baghdad creates many of the same medical response challenges that confronted military aid workers and physicians almost a century ago. In many ways, the world still lives in the shadow of April 1915.

6. Historians continue to debate the exact number of casualties incurred during World War I, because record keeping from that period is incomplete and much disputed. Figures vary widely depending on which sources are used and how the historian is trying to measure them. In the case of Russia and Turkey, no system for tracking either military or civilian deaths existed, so it is impossible to determine them with any accuracy. Historian Modris Eksteins estimates that 9 million died, while historian John Keegan places the number at 10 million and Ian F.W. Becekett at 9 million to 10 million. Still others, like Fritz Haber’s son Ludwig Haber, use a percentage of the European population to estimate the dead.

10. The concept of the “technological fix” is embedded in much of the history of technology. The idea that social, economic, and cultural problems can be solved quickly by applying technologies to them is most notably associated with the development of war technologies such as gas weapons, radar, and the gyroscope. However, as historians Hughes Thomas P. and Wiebe E. Bijker have illustrated, technological fixes are also an essential part of electrical systems and more everyday objects such as bicycles and light bulbs. On the technological fix, see Merritt Roe Smith and Leo Marx, Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1996), particularly the introduction. On the relationship between Hughes’s concepts of the technological fix and technological momentum, see Thomas P.

11. The mobilization of academic resources in Great Britain to solve the problem of gas warfare reflected the overall commitment of the country at large to prosecuting the war successfully. Scientists at Birmingham, Cambridge, Finsbury Technical College, Imperial College London, and St. Andrews carried out specific military research programs. Because British soldiers were initially unprepared for and unprotected from German gas attacks, defensive measures took first priority. The Army Medical College at Millbrook took the initial lead in developing protective devices, but soon physiology departments at Bedford College, the Lister Institute (including the animal station), Oxford University, the School of Agriculture in Cambridge, and University College London all contributed to the effort.

42. A 1919 article by Gross B.C. of the Chemical Warfare Service recommended attacking in wind conditions of less than 3 miles per hour at a relative humidity of 40% to 50%. The author noted that having considered “temperature, wind, and humidity conditions, the hours between midnight and daylight are usually the most favorable for a gas attack, and, in addition, surprise is more easily possible at this time.” Successful gas-based artillery barrages were designed to hit “small, definitely located targets known to be occupied [with a] concentrated fire of 2 minutes duration.” B.C.

45. German attacks employing mustard gas were extremely difficult for all Allied troops, especially newly arriving AEF. Unaccustomed to gas attacks under combat conditions with even chlorine and phosgene, the AEF moved to the front just as gas warfare entered its most violent and destructive phase. In addition, an earlier decision by American scientific, medical, and military leaders to focus almost exclusively on the gas mask in lieu of a more complete approach to gas defense and treatment may have been ill conceived. A 1926 US Army medical history of gas warfare noted that the “Medical Department of the United States Army with respect to gas warfare were [sic] concerned with furnishing gas masks and other prophylactic apparatus for the Army, rather than with preparation for the care and treatment of gas casualties.” Ireland, Medical Department of the United States Army in the World War, 27.

56. Norris, “Manufacture of War Gases in Germany,” 823–824. Norris was one of a group of Allied officers who toured the occupied zones along the Rhine after the war to gather intelligence (both military and industrial) on the state of the German chemical industry. His report on the Bayer Company plant at Höchst, which manufactured per-chloromethylformate (or superpalite), is intriguing, as it offers a window into one of the best designed and “safest” chemical production facilities in Germany. Norris writes that “In the early days they had several small explosions which were not serious. They had a large number of cases of poisoning among the workmen, which were also not serious. All the workers were supplied with gas masks and put them on in case of emergency only. The workers suffered from chest and heart affections. Two or three died during the time [sic] though our informant would not admit this was necessarily the cause of death. They sometimes had as many as one-third of the workers absent owing to sickness. The workers were not changed as they wished to retain those who could stand it. Only men were employed in the plant.” Norris, 824.
57. Ibid, 824. See also Haber, The Poisonous Cloud, 257–258. The German military relied on the methods of Victor Meyer involving the preparation of thioglycol by the Badische Company, which was later converted to mustard gas at the Bayer Company plant at Höchst. Norris, 821–822.

Finally, it is important to keep in mind that the US military’s invasion plans for Japan (Operation Downfall), originally scheduled to commence in November 1945, included provisions for the tactical and strategic use of atomic, biological, and chemical weapons against various military and civilian targets.
70. Throughout the 20th century, the number of civilian deaths increased at a startling rate. Only 14% of deaths during World War I were civilians; by contrast, the rate in World War II was 67%; by the 1980s the rate was 75%, and in the 1990s it reached 90%.

Russia: Drug Addiction Treatment Requires Reform
Injection Drug Users, Deprived of Best Remedies, Left to Own Devices

Russian health policies are failing to adequately treat drug addiction, compounding the country’s serious illicit drug use and drug dependence problem and further putting drug users at increased risk for other serious diseases, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Russia’s healthcare system restricts access to evidence-based drug dependence treatment for injection drug users, in violation of the government’s international obligations.
In the 110-page study, titled ""Rehabilitation Required: Russia’s Human Rights Obligation to Provide Evidence-based Drug Dependence Treatment,"" Human Rights Watch found that the treatment offered at state drug treatment clinics in Russia was so poor as to constitute a violation of the right to health. The report concluded that drug dependent people in Russia who want to overcome their dependence are left virtually to their own devices in their battle with this serious and chronic disease.
""The lack of effective drug addiction treatment in Russia means that drug users who want to break their addiction cannot, and are condemned to a life of continued drug use,"" said Diederik Lohman, senior researcher in Human Rights Watch’s HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Program. ""This leaves them vulnerable to HIV infection, other drug-related health conditions, and death by overdose.""
Russia faces a serious illicit drug use and drug dependence problem. Several million people in Russia are believed to be drug users, and hundreds of thousands of them are dependent on drugs. HIV has spread rapidly among injection drug users in Russia since the early 1990s; more than 10 percent of injection drug users are believed to be living with HIV.
Human Rights Watch’s report analyzes Russia’s dependence drug treatment system from the point of view of international best practices in addiction treatment and the international right to health. The report identifies, among others, the following problems:
• Russian law explicitly prohibits the use of the most effective and best researched drug dependence treatment approach for opiate dependence, methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment. Although UN agencies strongly endorse the use of these medications, which are successfully used in treating drug dependent people in dozens of countries, top Russian health and law enforcement officials oppose them.
• While detoxification treatment, which is aimed at safely withdrawing the patient from physical dependence on drugs, is available throughout Russia, rehabilitation treatment, which helps patients prevent relapses by helping them develop control over urges to use drugs, is available at state clinics in only about one-third of Russia’s regions. Research has clearly established that detoxification treatment on its own is not effective treatment. Russian law clearly stipulates that rehabilitation treatment should be available to drug users but the Russian government has failed to adopt a clear plan to set up rehabilitation centers throughout the country.
• Various barriers discourage drug users from seeking drug treatment in Russia. The most important barrier examined in the report is a state policy under which drug-dependent persons who voluntarily seek treatment are put on a drug-user registry. This registry is used to restrict drug users in their rights and is perceived as stigmatizing by most drug users. Research on drug-dependence treatment has found that treatment services should be easily accessible to ensure that the largest possible number of people seeks help.
• Russia has made little effort to incorporate lessons learned into its drug-dependence treatment services. The report examines how Russian treatment practices ignore much of the evidence yielded from decades of international research into drug-dependence treatment. The report found, for example, that Russia has failed to offer appropriate psychosocial counseling during detoxification treatment, even though research has found a direct link between the availability of such counseling and treatment success. Instead, patients in detoxification treatment are heavily sedated, making counseling efforts difficult or even pointless.
Due to these and other problems, the effectiveness of drug-treatment services offered at state clinics in Russia today is so low as to be negligible. Most patients remain in treatment for just a few weeks – despite the fact that research on drug-dependence treatment shows that, for most patients, treatment benefits start only after three months – and more than 90 percent return to using illicit drugs within a year of entering into treatment.
""Russia urgently needs to incorporate international best practices for drug treatment into its treatment system,"" said Lohman. ""Drug users, their families, and Russian society pay a hefty price for the failure to do so.""
Research in other countries has shown that evidence-based treatment of drug users leads to considerable savings on drug-use-related law enforcement efforts, incarcerations of drug users, and healthcare costs due to HIV, hepatitis C, and other drug-related health conditions.
Russian policymakers and the public often blame drug users for their failure to overcome their drug dependence. Some are currently advocating laws and policies that would allow the Russian state to force drug users into treatment.
""The vast majority of people who are dependent on drugs in Russia want to overcome their addiction,"" said Lohman. ""The Russian government must develop treatment programs that help them become free of addiction, not simply cast them aside.""

Napoleonic Wars and the United States, 1803–1815
The Napoleonic Wars continued the Wars of the French Revolution. Great Britain and France fought for European supremacy, and treated weaker powers heavy-handedly. The United States attempted to remain neutral during the Napoleonic period, but eventually became embroiled in the European conflicts, leading to the War of 1812 against Great Britain.
The Napoleonic Wars
Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in 1799 after overthrowing the French revolutionary government. During this time, U.S. and French negotiators were concluding negotiations to end the Quasi-War with France. In 1802, Napoleon ended ten years of warfare with Great Britain under the Peace of Amiens. He used this opportunity to attempt to crush the Haitian Revolution, but the army he sent met with defeat. Napoleon had also re-obtained the North American province of Louisiana from Spain in 1800. However, the loss of Haiti made Louisiana strategically undesirable, and with war again on the horizon with Great Britain, Napoleon was willing to agree to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
As expected, Britain declared war on France in 1803, and would remain at war for over a decade. During this period of war, Napoleon and British leaders concentrated on European affairs, but the conflict spilled over into the Atlantic. From 1803 to 1806, the United States succeeded in remaining neutral, but suffered from impressment, British seizure of British-born naturalized U.S. citizens into the British navy. President Thomas Jefferson sent William Pinkney and James Monroe to negotiate a treaty that would halt the impressment of American sailors, but when the signed treaty came back without any British concessions on the impressment issue, Jefferson did not pass it on to the Senate for ratification.
Napoleon Bonarparte
In 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree, which forbade trade with Britain, and the British Government responded the next year with Orders in Council, which instituted a blockade of French-controlled Europe, and authorized the British navy to seize ships violating the blockade. Napoleon responded with further trade restrictions in the Milan Decree of 1807.
U.S. relations with Great Britain became increasingly rocky during this period. On June 22, 1807, the H.M.S. Leopard bombarded and forcibly boarded the U.S.S. Chesapeake off Norfolk, Virginia in search of British navy deserters. President Jefferson responded with an embargo on all foreign trade in an effort to weaken the British economy. The embargo was extremely unpopular in New England, where the economy was heavily dependent on trade with Britain. Moreover, the British economy was not strongly affected by the embargo, which proved difficult to enforce. In early 1809, in one of his final acts as president, Jefferson replaced the embargo with the Non-Intercourse Act, which allowed trade with other nations except Britain and France. This act also proved virtually impossible to enforce.
James Madison
Jefferson’s successor, President James Madison, confronted a dilemma—to continue with the ineffective Non-Intercourse Act was effectively to submit to British terms of trade since the British navy controlled the Atlantic. Madison was assisted by the passage in 1810 of Nathaniel Macon’s Bill No. 2, which offered Britain and France the option of ceasing their seizure of U.S. merchant ships in return for U.S. participation in their trade bloc. Napoleon was the first to offer concessions, which Madison publicly accepted at face value despite his private skepticism. In doing so, Madison pushed the United States closer to war with Britain.
During this period, Madison also had to address a problem created by Secretary of State, Robert Smith, who had personally stated to the British minister his pro-British sympathies. When Madison confronted Smith and offered him a graceful departure as U.S. Minister to Russia, Smith appeared to accept his offer, and then leaked cabinet papers as part of a smear campaign against President Madison. U.S. diplomat Joel Barlow published a reply and swung public opinion against Smith, who resigned on April 1, 1811.
Relations with Great Britain continued to deteriorate. A U.S. Navy ship mistook a much smaller British ship, the HMS Little Belt, for a British Navy ship that had impressed American sailors and fired upon it. Consequently, Thomas Foster, British Minister to the United States, stated that Britain would not offer any compensation for the 1807 Chesapeake incident. Foster also informed Madison that the British Government would not revoke the Orders in Council. By the spring of 1812, Madison had decided upon war with Great Britain—although he also considered declaring war on France as well. Congress passed a declaration of war on June 17, which Madison signed the next day. The war continued into 1815, although diplomats signed the Treaty of Ghent on December 23, 1814.
The Napoleonic Wars marked a period of U.S. weakness in the face of British power. However, in the postwar period, British policies began to soften, leading to the Rush-Bagot agreement and the Convention of 1818.

The Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles

In 1919, the Big Four met in Paris to negotiate the Treaty: Lloyd George of Britain, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando of Italy, Georges Clemenceau of France, and Woodrow Wilson of the U.S. The Paris Peace Conference was an international meeting convened in January 1919 at Versailles just outside Paris. The purpose of the meeting was to establish the terms of the peace after World War. Though nearly thirty nations participated, the representatives of Great Britain, France, the United States, and Italy became known as the ""Big Four."" The ""Big Four"" would dominate the proceedings that led to the formulation of the Treaty of Versailles, a treaty that articulated the compromises reached at the conference. The Treaty of Versailles included a plan to form a League of Nations that would serve as an international forum and an international collective security arrangement. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson was a strong advocate of the League as he believed it would prevent future wars.
Negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference were not always easy. Great Britain, France, and Italy fought together during the First World War as Allied Powers. The United States, entered the war in April 1917 as an Associated Power, and while it fought on the side of the Allies, it was not bound to honor pre-existing agreements between the Allied powers. These agreements tended to focus on postwar redistribution of territories. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson strongly opposed many of these arrangements, including Italian demands on the Adriatic. This often led to significant disagreements among the ""Big Four.""
Treaty negotiations were also weakened by the absence of other important nations. Russia had fought as one of the Allies until December 1917, when its new Bolshevik Government withdrew from the war. The Allied Powers refused to recognize the new Bolshevik Government and thus did not invite its representatives to the Peace Conference. The Allies were angered by the Bolshevik decision to repudiate Russia's outstanding financial debts to the Allies and to publish the texts of secret agreements between the Allies concerning the postwar period. The Allies also excluded the defeated Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria).
According to French and British wishes, Germany was subjected to strict punitive measures under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The new German government was required to surrender approximately 10 percent of its prewar territory in Europe and all of its overseas possessions. The harbor city of Danzig (now Gdansk) and the coal-rich Saarland were placed under the administration of the League of Nations, and France was allowed to exploit the economic resources of the Saarland until 1935. The German Army and Navy were limited in size. Kaiser Wilhelm II and a number of other high-ranking German officials were to be tried as war criminals. Under the terms of Article 231 of the treaty, the Germans accepted responsibility for the war and, as such, were liable to pay financial reparations to the Allies, though the actual amount would be determined by an Inter-Allied Commission that would present its findings in 1921 (the amount they determined was 132 billion gold Reichmarks, or $32 billion, which came on top of an initial $5 billion payment demanded by the treaty). Germans would grow to resent these harsh conditions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles.
While the Treaty of Versailles did not present a peace agreement that satisfied all parties concerned, by the time President Woodrow Wilson returned to the United States in July 1919, American public opinion was overwhelming in favor of ratifying the treaty, including the Covenant of the League of Nations. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that 32 state legislatures passed resolutions in favor of the treaty, there was intense opposition to it within the U.S. Senate.
Senate opposition to the Treaty of Versailles cited Article 10 of the treaty, which dealt with collective security and the League of Nations. This article, opponents argued, ceded the war powers of the U.S. Government to the League's Council. The opposition came from two groups: the ""Irreconcilables,"" who refused to join the League of Nations under any circumstances, and ""Reservationists,"" led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, Henry Cabot Lodge, who were willing to ratify the treaty with amendments. While Lodge was defeated in his attempt to pass amendments to the Treaty in September, he did manage to attach 14 ""reservations"" to it in November. In a final vote on March 19, 1920, the Treaty of Versailles fell short of ratification by seven votes. Consequently, the U.S. Government signed the Treaty of Berlin on August 25, 1921. This was a separate peace treaty with Germany that stipulated that the United States would enjoy all ""rights, privileges, indemnities, reparations or advantages"" conferred to it by the Treaty of Versailles, but left out any mention of the League of Nations, which the United States never joined.

The Warsaw Treaty Organization, 1955
The Warsaw Treaty Organization (also known as the Warsaw Pact) was a political and military alliance established on May 14, 1955 between the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries. The Soviet Union formed this alliance as a counterbalance to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a collective security alliance concluded between the United States, Canada and Western European nations in 1949.

The Warsaw Pact supplemented existing agreements. Following World War II, the Soviet Union had concluded bilateral treaties with each of the East European states except for East Germany, which was still part of the Soviet occupied-territory of Germany. When the Federal Republic of Germany entered NATO in early May 1955, the Soviets feared the consequences of a strengthened NATO and a rearmed West Germany and hoped that the Warsaw Treaty Organization could both contain West Germany and negotiate with NATO as an equal partner. Soviet leadership also noted that civil unrest was on the rise in Eastern European countries and determined that a unified, multilateral political and military alliance would tie Eastern European capitals more closely to Moscow.
The original signatories to the Warsaw Treaty Organization were the Soviet Union, Albania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic. Although the members of the Warsaw Pact pledged to defend each other if one or more of them came under attack, emphasized non-interference in the internal affairs of its members, and supposedly organized itself around collective decision-making, the Soviet Union ultimately controlled most of the Pact’s decisions. The Soviet Union also used the Pact to contain popular dissent in its European satellites, for example in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland in 1981.
By the 1980s, the Warsaw Treaty Organization was beset by problems related to the economic slowdown in all Eastern European countries. By the late 1980s political changes in most of the member states made the Pact virtually ineffectual. In September 1990, East Germany left the Pact in preparation for reunification with West Germany. By October, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland had withdrawn from all Warsaw Pact military exercises. The Warsaw Pact officially disbanded in March and July of 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Occupation and Reconstruction of Japan, 1945–52
After the defeat of Japan in World War II, the United States led the Allies in the occupation and rehabilitation of the Japanese state. Between 1945 and 1952, the U.S. occupying forces, led by General Douglas A. MacArthur, enacted widespread military, political, economic, and social reforms.
Allied Occupation in Japan after WWII
The groundwork for the Allied occupation of a defeated Japan was laid during the war. In a series of wartime conferences, the leaders of the Allied powers of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the Republic of China, and the United States discussed how to disarm Japan, deal with its colonies (especially Korea and Taiwan), stabilize the Japanese economy, and prevent the remilitarization of the state in the future. In the Potsdam Declaration, they called for Japan’s unconditional surrender; by August of 1945, that objective had been achieved.
In September, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur took charge of the Supreme Command of Allied Powers (SCAP) and began the work of rebuilding Japan. Although Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China had an advisory role as part of an “Allied Council,” MacArthur had the final authority to make all decisions. The occupation of Japan can be divided into three phases: the initial effort to punish and reform Japan, the work to revive the Japanese economy, and the conclusion of a formal peace treaty and alliance.
The first phase, roughly from the end of the war in 1945 through 1947, involved the most fundamental changes for the Japanese Government and society. The Allies punished Japan for its past militarism and expansion by convening war crimes trials in Tokyo. At the same time, SCAP dismantled the Japanese Army and banned former military officers from taking roles of political leadership in the new government. In the economic field, SCAP introduced land reform, designed to benefit the majority tenant farmers and reduce the power of rich landowners, many of whom had advocated for war and supported Japanese expansionism in the 1930s. MacArthur also tried to break up the large Japanese business conglomerates, or zaibatsu, as part of the effort to transform the economy into a free market capitalist system. In 1947, Allied advisors essentially dictated a new constitution to Japan’s leaders. Some of the most profound changes in the document included downgrading the emperor’s status to that of a figurehead without political control and placing more power in the parliamentary system, promoting greater rights and privileges for women, and renouncing the right to wage war, which involved eliminating all non-defensive armed forces.
General MacArthur and Japanese Emperor Hirohito
By late 1947 and early 1948, the emergence of an economic crisis in Japan alongside concerns about the spread of communism sparked a reconsideration of occupation policies. This period is sometimes called the “reverse course.” In this stage of the occupation, which lasted until 1950, the economic rehabilitation of Japan took center stage. SCAP became concerned that a weak Japanese economy would increase the influence of the domestic communist movement, and with a communist victory in China’s civil war increasingly likely, the future of East Asia appeared to be at stake. Occupation policies to address the weakening economy ranged from tax reforms to measures aimed at controlling inflation. However the most serious problem was the shortage of raw materials required to feed Japanese industries and markets for finished goods. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 provided SCAP with just the opportunity it needed to address this problem, prompting some occupation officials to suggest that, “Korea came along and saved us.” After the UN entered the Korean War, Japan became the principal supply depot for UN forces. The conflict also placed Japan firmly within the confines of the U.S. defense perimeter in Asia, assuring the Japanese leadership that whatever the state of its military, no real threat would be made against Japanese soil.
In the third phase of the occupation, beginning in 1950, SCAP deemed the political and economic future of Japan firmly established and set about securing a formal peace treaty to end both the war and the occupation. The U.S. perception of international threats had changed so profoundly in the years between 1945 and 1950 that the idea of a re-armed and militant Japan no longer alarmed U.S. officials; instead, the real threat appeared to be the creep of communism, particularly in Asia. The final agreement allowed the United States to maintain its bases in Okinawa and elsewhere in Japan, and the U.S. Government promised Japan a bilateral security pact. In September of 1951, fifty-two nations met in San Francisco to discuss the treaty, and ultimately, forty-nine of them signed it. Notable holdouts included the USSR, Poland and Czechoslovakia, all of which objected to the promise to support the Republic of China and not do business with the People’s Republic of China that was forced on Japan by U.S. politicians.

The Treaty of Portsmouth and the Russo-Japanese War, 1904–1905
The Treaty of Portsmouth formally ended the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The negotiations took place in August in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and were brokered in part by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. The final agreement was signed in September of 1905, and it affirmed the Japanese presence in south Manchuria and Korea and ceded the southern half of the island of Sakhalin to Japan.

By 1904, Russia and Japan had endured several years of disputes over control of Manchuria. The Russians had entered the region during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 and, along with Germany and France, was a part of the “Triple Intervention” that forced Japan to give up its demands for ports in South Manchuria and the Liaodong Peninsula in the wake of its victory in China. Instead, Russia moved into the area and took control of Port Arthur, a warm water port with strategic and commercial significance. A Japanese attempt to stage a coup in adjacent Korea was thwarted in part by the Russian presence in the region, and the two nations’ divergent interests appeared more and more likely to clash.
In 1904, the Japanese attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur before the formal declaration of war was received in Moscow, surprising the Russian navy and earning an early victory. Over the course of the next year, the two forces clashed in Korea and the Sea of Japan, with the Japanese scoring significant, but costly, victories. War casualties were high on both sides. At the battle over Mukden, the Russians lost 60,000 soldiers and the Japanese lost 41,000 soldiers. The military costs were high as well. A Russian fleet made the long trip from the Baltic Sea around Africa and India, only to be half destroyed by the Japanese upon its arrival in Northeast Asia. By 1905, the combination of these losses and the economic cost of financing the war led both countries to seek an end to the war.

The Japanese asked U.S. President Roosevelt to negotiate a peace agreement, and representatives of the two nations met in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1905. For the sake of maintaining the balance of power and equal economic opportunity in the region, Roosevelt preferred that the war end on terms that left both Russia and Japan a role to play in Northeast China. Though excited by the Japanese military victories, Roosevelt worried about the consequences to American interests if Japan managed to drive Russia out entirely.
The negotiations centered on access to ports and territories in Manchuria and Korea, control of Sakhalin Island, and the question of who was responsible for paying war costs. The chief aims of the Japanese negotiator included first control in Korea and South Manchuria, then the negotiation of an indemnity and control of Sakhalin Island. The Russians wanted to maintain Sakhalin Island, refused to pay a war costs indemnity to the Japanese, and hoped to maintain their fleet in the Pacific. The indemnity issue, along with the dispensation of Sakhalin Island, were the major sticking points in the negotiation, although given its financial straits in 1905, Russia was likely unable to pay an indemnity even if required by a treaty to do so.
When negotiations reached an impasse, Roosevelt stepped in with the proposal that Russia “buy back” the northern part of Sakhalin from Japanese control. The Russians were adamant that they would not pay any amount of money, which would act as a disguised indemnity, when the territory ought to be theirs. After long internal debate, Japan eventually agreed to take only the southern half of the island, without any kind of payment. Theirs had not been a decisive enough victory to force the point.
The Treaty ultimately gave Japan control of Korea and much of South Manchuria, including Port Arthur and the railway that connected it with the rest of the region, along with the southern half of Sakhalin Island; Russian power was curtailed in the region, but it was not required to pay Japan’s war costs. Because neither nation was in a strong financial position to continue the war easily, both were forced to compromise in the terms of the peace. Still, the Japanese public felt they had won the war, and they considered the lack of an indemnity to be an affront. There was a brief outbreak of protests and rioting in Tokyo when the terms of the agreement were made public. Similarly, the Russian people were also dissatisfied, angry about giving up half of Sakhalin.
Individuals gathered to work out what became the Treaty of Portsmouth
Throughout the war and the peace talks, American public opinion largely sided with Japan. Believing that the Japanese were fighting a “just war” against Russian aggression, and that the island nation was equally committed to the Open Door and the territorial integrity of China, the American people were anxious to support it. This sense did not really change over the course of the negotiations, in spite of the best efforts of the Russian negotiator to improve the press coverage of his nation’s position. The final decision of the Japanese to forgo an indemnity only served to strengthen U.S. approval of Japan’s actions throughout the conflict. The anti-treaty and, at times, anti-American demonstrations in Tokyo that followed the ratification of the treaty caught many Americans off-guard.
The Treaty of Portsmouth marked the last real event in an era of U.S.-Japanese cooperation that began with the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Instead, competition between the two nations in the Pacific grew over the years that followed. Conversely, Japanese relations with Russia improved in the wake of the treaty. Although the actual importance of Roosevelt’s mediation and personal pressure on the leadership in Moscow and Tokyo to the final agreement is unclear, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in moderating the talks and pushing toward peace.

Japan, China, the United States and the Road to Pearl Harbor, 1937–41
Between 1937 and 1941, escalating conflict between China and Japan influenced U.S. relations with both nations, and ultimately contributed to pushing the United States toward full-scale war with Japan and Germany.
Photograph of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident
At the outset, U.S. officials viewed developments in China with ambivalence. On the one hand, they opposed Japanese incursions into northeast China and the rise of Japanese militarism in the area, in part because of their sense of a longstanding friendship with China. On the other hand, most U.S. officials believed that it had no vital interests in China worth going to war over with Japan. Moreover, the domestic conflict between Chinese Nationalists and Communists left U.S. policymakers uncertain of success in aiding such an internally divided nation. As a result, few U.S. officials recommended taking a strong stance prior to 1937, and so the United States did little to help China for fear of provoking Japan. U.S. likelihood of providing aid to China increased after July 7, 1937, when Chinese and Japanese forces clashed on the Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing, throwing the two nations into a full-scale war. As the United States watched Japanese forces sweep down the coast and then into the capital of Nanjing, popular opinion swung firmly in favor of the Chinese. Tensions with Japan rose when the Japanese Army bombed the U.S.S. Panay as it evacuated American citizens from Nanjing, killing three. The U.S. Government, however, continued to avoid conflict and accepted an apology and indemnity from the Japanese. An uneasy truce held between the two nations into 1940.
FDR signing Lend-Lease
In 1940 and 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt formalized U.S. aid to China. The U.S. Government extended credits to the Chinese Government for the purchase of war supplies, as it slowly began to tighten restrictions on Japan. The United States was the main supplier of the oil, steel, iron, and other commodities needed by the Japanese military as it became bogged down by Chinese resistance but, in January, 1940, Japan abrogated the existing treaty of commerce with the United States. Although this did not lead to an immediate embargo, it meant that the Roosevelt Administration could now restrict the flow of military supplies into Japan and use this as leverage to force Japan to halt its aggression in China.
After January 1940, the United States combined a strategy of increasing aid to China through larger credits and the Lend-Lease program with a gradual move towards an embargo on the trade of all militarily useful items with Japan. The Japanese Government made several decisions during these two years that exacerbated the situation. Unable or unwilling to control the military, Japan’s political leaders sought greater security by establishing the “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” in August, 1940. In so doing they announced Japan’s intention to drive the Western imperialist nations from Asia. However, this Japanese-led project aimed to enhance Japan’s economic and material wealth so that it would not be dependent upon supplies from the West, and not to “liberate” the long-subject peoples of Asia. In fact, Japan would have to launch a campaign of military conquest and rule, and did not intend to pull out of China. At the same time, several pacts with Western nations only made Japan appear more of a threat to the United States. First, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy on September 27, 1940 and thereby linked the conflicts in Europe and Asia. This made China a potential ally in the global fight against fascism. Then in mid-1941, Japan signed a Neutrality Pact with the Soviet Union, making it clear that Japan’s military would be moving into Southeast Asia, where the United States had greater interests. A third agreement with Vichy France enabled Japanese forces to move into Indochina and begin their Southern Advance. The United States responded to this growing threat by temporarily halting negotiations with Japanese diplomats, instituting a full embargo on exports to Japan, freezing Japanese assets in U.S. banks, and sending supplies into China along the Burma Road. Although negotiations restarted after the United States increasingly enforced an embargo against Japan, they made little headway. Diplomats in Washington came close to agreements on a couple of occasions, but pro-Chinese sentiments in the United States made it difficult to reach any resolution that would not involve a Japanese withdrawal from China, and such a condition was unacceptable to Japan’s military leaders.
Faced with serious shortages as a result of the embargo, unable to retreat, and convinced that the U.S. officials opposed further negotiations, Japan’s leaders came to the conclusion that they had to act swiftly. For their part, U.S. leaders had not given up on a negotiated settlement, and also doubted that Japan had the military strength to attack the U.S. territory. Therefore they were stunned when the unthinkable happened and Japanese planes bombed the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The following day, the United States declared war on Japan, and it soon entered into a military alliance with China. When Germany stood by its ally and declared war on the United States, the Roosevelt Administration faced war in both Europe and Asia.

Japanese-American Relations at the Turn of the Century, 1900–1922
In the first two decades of the twentieth century, the relationship between the United States and Japan was marked by increasing tension and corresponding attempts to use diplomacy to reduce the threat of conflict. Each side had territory and interests in Asia that they were concerned the other might threaten. U.S. treatment of Japanese immigrants, and competition for economic and commercial opportunities in China also heightened tensions. At the same time, each country’s territorial claims in the Pacific formed the basis for several agreements between the two nations, as each government sought to protect its own strategic and economic interests.
Prime Minister Katsura Taro
At the turn of the century, U.S. and Japanese interests appeared to be aligned. Both nations supported the idea of an “open door” for commercial expansion in China. After the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt acted as a mediator at Japan’s request, and the two sides of the conflict met on neutral territory in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In the same year, U.S. Secretary of War William Howard Taft met with Prime Minister Katsura Taro in Japan. The two concluded the secret Taft-Katsura Agreement, in which the United States acknowledged Japanese rule over Korea and condoned the Anglo-Japanese alliance of 1902. At the same time, Japan recognized U.S. control of the Philippines.
In the years that followed, however, tensions rose over Japanese actions in northeast China and immigration to the United States. In 1905, the Japanese started to establish more formal control over South Manchuria by forcing China to give Japan ownership rights to the South Manchurian Railway. The Japanese used this opening to make further inroads into northeast China, causing the Roosevelt Administration concern that this violated the ideals of free enterprise and the preservation of China’s territorial integrity. Simultaneously, leading Japanese officials expressed frustration with the treatment of Japanese immigrants in the United States. A U.S.-Japanese treaty signed in 1894 had guaranteed the Japanese the right to immigrate to the United States, and to enjoy the same rights in the country as U.S. citizens. In 1906, however, the San Francisco Board of Education enacted a measure to send Japanese and Chinese children to segregated schools. The Government of Japan was outraged by this policy, claiming that it violated the 1894 treaty. In a series of notes exchanged between late 1907 and early 1908, known collectively as the Gentlemen’s Agreement, the U.S. Government agreed to pressure the San Francisco authorities to withdraw the measure, and the Japanese Government promised to restrict the immigration of laborers to the United States.
Secretary of State Elihu Root
With the immigration problem temporarily settled, the two countries met to provide mutual reassurances about their territories and interests in East Asia. In 1908, U.S Secretary of State Elihu Root and Japanese Ambassador Takahira Kogoro formed an agreement in which Japan promised to respect U.S. territorial possessions in the Pacific, its Open Door policy in China, and the limitation of immigration to the United States as outlined in the Gentlemen’s Agreement. The Government of Japan redirected its labor emigrants to its holdings in Manchuria, maintaining that these were not a part of China. For its part, the United States recognized Japanese control of Taiwan and the Pescadores, and the Japanese special interest in Manchuria. By reiterating each country’s position in the region, the Root-Takahira Agreement served to lessen the threat of a misunderstanding or war between the two nations.
This series of agreements still did not resolve all of the outstanding issues. U.S. treatment of Japanese residents continued to cause tension between the two nations. The Alien Land Act of 1913, for example, barred Japanese from owning or leasing land for longer than three years and adversely affected U.S.-Japanese relations in the years leading up to World War I. Economic competition in China, which the United States feared would result in increasing Japanese control, was another issue that increased tensions between the two nations. In 1915, the Japanese issued its “Twenty-One Demands” of China, in which it asked that China recognize its territorial claims, prevent other powers from obtaining new concessions along its coast, and take a series of actions designed to benefit the Japanese economically. China turned to the United States for assistance, and U.S. officials responded with a declaration that they would not recognize any agreement that threatened the Open Door. Although this was consistent with past policies, this announcement was of little use to the Chinese. However, President Woodrow Wilson was not willing to take a stronger stand given his need for assistance in protecting U.S. interests in Asia, addressing the growing conflict in Europe, and managing racial issues in California.
Secretary of State Robert Lansing
The potential for conflict between the United States and Japan, especially over China, led the two governments to negotiate yet again. In the Ishii-Lansing Agreement of 1917, Secretary of State Robert Lansing acknowledged that Manchuria was under Japanese control, while Japanese Foreign Minister Ishii Kikujiro agreed not to place limitations on U.S. commercial opportunities elsewhere in China. The two powers also agreed not to take advantage of the war in Europe to seek additional rights and privileges. Though non-binding, Lansing considered the agreement an important measure in promoting mutual interests in Asia, but it proved short-lived. Ultimately, the two nations agreed to cancel the Ishii-Lansing Agreement after concluding the Nine-Power Treaty, which they signed in 1922 at the Washington Conference.
Japan and the United States clashed again during the League of Nations negotiations in 1919. The United States refused to accept the Japanese request for a racial equality clause or an admission of the equality of the nations. In addition, the Versailles Treaty granted Japan control over valuable German concessions in Shandong, which led to an outcry in China. This coupled with the growing fear of a militant Japan, contributed to the defeat of the League Covenant in the U.S. Senate. The persistent issues preventing accommodation continued to be racial equality (especially with regard to the treatment of Japanese immigrants in the United States) and differences in how to address expansion in Asia. In spite of the many efforts to reach agreements on these points, by the early 1920s Japan and the United States were again at odds.

United States Relations with Russia: The Cold War
1945-1949
1945-1946: Creation of Eastern European People's Republics
Between November 1945 and December 1946, a number of the coalition governments established in the Eastern European countries occupied by Soviet troops during the war transformed into Communist ""People's Republics"" with strong ties to the Soviet Union. These included Yugoslavia (November 1945); Albania (January 1946); and Bulgaria (December 1946). The United States and Britain considered this an abrogation of agreements made at the Yalta Conference.
February 1946: George Kennan's Long Telegram and the Policy of Containment
On February 22, 1946, George F. Kennan, the Charg� d'Affaires at the Moscow Embassy, sent a long telegram to the Department of State detailing his concerns about Soviet expansionism. Kennan argued that the United States would never be able to cooperate successfully with the Soviets, because they saw the West as an enemy and would engage in a protracted battle to limit Western power and increase Soviet domination. Kennan argued that the United States should lead the West in ""containing"" the Soviets by exerting counterforce at various geographical and political points of conflict. Kennan published a public version of this argument in the July 1947 issue of the journal Foreign Affairs. Kennan's articulations of the policy of containment had a major influence on American foreign policy toward the Soviet Union.
March 1946: Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech
During a speech at Fulton, Missouri, on March 5, 1946, visiting British Prime Minister Winston Churchill proclaimed that Europe was divided by an ""Iron Curtain"" as the nations of Eastern Europe fell increasingly under Soviet control. Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia all fell under Communist control by early 1948.
Spring 1946: Soviet Troops in Iran
Responding to Iranian requests to the United Nations, on March 5, 1946, the United States sent a note to Moscow protesting the retention of Soviet troops in Iran, where Stalin wanted to establish Soviet influence. On April 3, the Soviet Union announced that its troops would leave by May 6.
March 1947: Truman Doctrine
The Soviets aimed also to establish influence over Turkey and Greece in an effort to seek access to the Mediterranean. President Truman delivered a speech before Congress on March 12, 1947, asking for $400 million to provide assistance for Greece and Turkey in the hopes of bolstering pro-Western governments there. In this speech, he enunciated the Truman Doctrine that would serve to justify the U.S. Cold War policy of containment. This doctrine described the U.S. policy of supporting free peoples who resisted subjugation from armed minorities or outside pressures.
June 1947: U.S. Efforts to Control Atomic Energy
In June 1947, the United States submitted proposals, know as the Baruch Plan, for the creation of an International Atomic Energy Development Authority to control all phases of the development and use of atomic energy. The United States offered to destroy its atomic weapons after international control and inspection became effective. The Soviet Union rejected the proposal.
June 5, 1947: Marshall's Offer of Economic Assistance
In a speech given at Harvard University on June 5, 1947, Secretary of State George C. Marshall offered U.S. assistance for the postwar economic rehabilitation of all European nations, including those that had adopted Communist governments. The Soviet Union denounced the Marshall Plan, saying it would infringe upon European sovereignty. Western European nations accepted Marshall's offer, while the Eastern European states followed Moscow's lead.
1948-1949: Berlin Airlift
In the summer of 1948, the Soviet Union cut off access to the Western sectors of Berlin, situated in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. The Western powers organized a massive airlift to supply West Berlin, and organized a counter-blockade of the Soviet zone. On May 12, 1949, the Soviets lifted their blockade.
April 1949: North Atlantic Treaty Organization
On April 14, 1949, twelve Western nations signed the North Atlantic Treaty providing for mutual support in the event of a military attack on any of the parties to the treaty and established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The original members of NATO were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
September-October 1949: Creation of the two Germanys
Recognizing that the Soviets would not honor agreements to reunite the German zones of occupation, the Western powers moved in the fall of 1949 to establish the Federal Republic of Germany out of the Western zones of occupation. The Soviets countered by supporting the creation of the German Democratic Republic in their zone. Berlin remained divided.
September 1949: Soviet Atomic Bomb
On September 22, 1949, President Truman announced that the Soviet Union had detonated its first atomic bomb.
1950-1959
February 1950: Sino-Soviet Treaty
Despite U.S. efforts, mainland China became a Communist People's Republic. The Soviets and the Chinese signed a Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship on February 14, 1950.
April 1950: NSC-68
In April 1950, Truman signed National Security Council Paper 68 (NSC-68) outlining U.S. justifications for a rapid and massive U.S. military build-up. NSC-68 cited Soviet consolidation of power in Eastern Europe, Soviet expansionist tendencies, and the need for the West to contain the Soviet Union as the justifications for the United States to pursue a significant buildup of its conventional military and nuclear resources.
1950-1953: Korean War
Following World War II, the United States administered the southern occupation zone in Korea, while the Soviets administered the northern zone. Plans to unify the two zones never materialized. On June 25, 1950, North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea. U.S.-led United Nations forces responded, and battled the North Korean and Communist Chinese armies. The Soviet Union supplied North Korea and China. On July 27, 1953, the warring parties concluded an armistice that restored the 38th parallel, but failed to unite North and South Korea.
November 1952: U.S. Hydrogen Bomb
On November 1, 1952, the United States announced it had successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.
March 1953: Stalin's Death
The Soviet Union's hard-line leader, Joseph Stalin, died on March 5, 1953, and the Soviet Union entered a period of collective leadership under which a handful of leaders from within the Presidium of the Communist Party shared leadership responsibilities. First Secretary of the Communist Party, Nikita Khrushchev, ultimately consolidated power and became the de facto leader of the Soviet Union.
August 1953: Soviet Hydrogen Bomb
On August 8, 1953, the Soviet Union announced it had hydrogen bomb capabilities.
August 1954: Atomic Energy Act
President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Atomic Energy Act in August 1954 to authorize the international exchange of information on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and endorsed the development of commercial nuclear power.
May 1955: Creation of the Warsaw Pact
In response to NATO actions in the West, including the rearming of West Germany and the expansion of the treaty organization, on May 1, 1955, the Soviet Union concluded a military defensive alliance known as the Warsaw Pact with Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.
May 1955: Austrian State Treaty
The United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France signed the Austrian State Treaty on May 15, 1955. This officially ended the four-power occupation of Austria and enabled the Austrians, who had pledged to remain neutral, to receive diplomatic recognition as an independent nation.
July 1955: Big Four Geneva Summit
Eisenhower met with Soviet Premier Nicolai Bulganin, British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, and French Premier Edgar Faure at a summit in Geneva in July 1955. Eisenhower offered an ""Open Skies"" proposal, calling for a U.S.-Soviet exchange of military blueprints and mutual aerial inspection of one another's military installations. The participants also discussed disarmament, German reunification through free elections, European security, and the need for East-West cultural and scientific exchange.
February 1956: Twentieth Congress of Soviet Communist Party
At the Twentieth Party Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in February 1956, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev publicly denounced aspects of Stalin's regime, including Stalin's harsh political purges and his ""cult of personality."" Khrushchev also reversed Stalinist policy by urging ""the peaceful coexistence between states with differing political and social systems."" This marked the beginning of a brief loosening of the most stringent forms of censorship in the Soviet Union.
June 1956: Polish Uprising
Riots against the Communist regime in Poland broke out at Poznan in June 1956, after workers demonstrated for better social and economic conditions. The revolt led the Polish Communist leadership to allow some reforms.
Autumn 1956: Suez Crisis
After the United States reneged on a deal to finance the building of the Aswan Dam, Egypt seized and nationalized the Suez Canal, through which the West received its oil supplies. This led to Israeli, British, and French military action against an Egyptian military supplied by the Soviets in the fall of 1956. While Western Europe focused on the Middle East, the Soviets moved to squash anti-communist rebellions in Poland and Hungary. Eisenhower, fearing that the Soviets would provide large-scale assistance to Egypt, convinced Britain, France, and Israel to retreat.
October-November 1956: Hungarian Uprising
Anti-Soviet popular uprisings began in Budapest and spread throughout Hungary in the autumn of 1956. On November 2, Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy, who had already promised the Hungarians free elections, denounced the Warsaw Pact and asked for United Nations support. On November 4, Soviet forces moved into Hungary and suppressed the revolt. The United States sponsored UN resolutions condemning the Soviet invasion, and called for the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops. The U.S. Government also took measures to assist the many refugees who fled Hungary following the invasion.
1957-1958: Sputnik and the Space Race
On October 5, 1957, the Soviets beat the United States into space by successfully launching the first man-made earth satellite, Sputnik I, into orbit. A month later, the Soviets sent up another satellite, this time carrying a dog. The United States did not launch its first satellite, Explorer I, until January 31, 1958. U.S. politicians warned of the dangers of Soviet superiority in technology and science, and speculated that the Soviets might possess superior missile stockpiles.
1958: Suspension of Nuclear Tests
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko announced the suspension of Soviet nuclear weapons tests on March 31, 1958. On October 25, the United States and Great Britain agreed to suspend nuclear weapons testing for one year. Three-power talks on a more permanent ban of nuclear testing began at Geneva on October 31.
November 1958: Khrushchev's Berlin Demands
Motivated by fears that the West planned to arm West Germany with nuclear weapons, in November 1958, Khrushchev demanded the termination of the four-power occupation of Berlin. The Soviets also threatened to conclude a separate peace treaty with East Germany, giving Soviets control over access to Berlin, unless negotiations began within 6 months.
September 1959: Khrushchev Visits the United States
Following brief meetings with Eisenhower upon his arrival in Washington on September 15, 1959, Khrushchev embarked on a 10-day trip to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, farm communities in Iowa, and Pittsburgh, arranged to acquaint him with the American way of life. Eisenhower and Khrushchev then engaged in substantive talks for 2 days at Camp David. Khrushchev also visited Eisenhower's farm at Gettysburg. Just before he left, Khrushchev addressed the American people on national television. This was first visit to the United States of a Soviet leader since the establishment of U.S.-Soviet relations in 1933.
September 1959: Khrushchev-Eisenhower Meeting at Camp David
Khrushchev met with President Eisenhower at Camp David, on September 26-27, 1959. The two leaders agreed to expand exchanges and to remove the Soviet deadline for a Berlin settlement, but no progress was made on disarmament or the reunification of Germany. They agreed to meet again at a four-power summit in Paris in May 1960.
December 1959: Antarctic Treaty
On December 1, the United States, the Soviet Union, and ten other countries signed a treaty to internationalize and demilitarize the Antarctic continent.
1960-1969
May 1960: The U-2 Incident
On May 1, 1960, the Soviets shot down an American U-2 reconnaissance jet flying over Soviet territory. Since June 1956, Eisenhower had approved secret overflights of Soviet territory, and gained valuable proof that the Soviets had not gained missile superiority over the Americans. Not knowing that the Soviets had captured the pilot and gotten a confession confirming the spy mission, Eisenhower claimed the aircraft was merely a weather plane. Khrushchev presented the pilot as proof that the American President had lied.
May 1960: Paris Summit
Eisenhower, Khrushchev, British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan, and French President Charles de Gaulle met from May 16-17, 1960, in Paris. However, the meetings collapsed when Khrushchev walked out after Eisenhower refused to apologize for the U-2 incident.
May 1960: United States Unveils ""Great Seal Bug"" at the United Nations
On May 26, 1960, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. unveiled the Great Seal Bug before the UN Security Council to counter Soviet denunciations of American U-2 espionage. The Soviets had presented a replica of the Great Seal of the United States as a gift to Ambassador Averell Harriman in 1946. The gift hung in the U.S. Embassy for many years, until in 1952, during George F. Kennan's ambassadorship, U.S. security personnel discovered the listening device embedded inside the Great Seal. Lodge's unveiling of this Great Seal before the Security Council in 1960 provided proof that the Soviets also spied on the Americans, and undercut a Soviet resolution before the Security Council denouncing the United States for its U-2 espionage missions.
June 1961: Vienna Meeting
President John F. Kennedy and Khrushchev met in Vienna in June 1961, primarily to discuss the status of Berlin. Other topics of discussion included the conflict in Laos and disarmament. The leaders were unable to resolve the most vexing questions pertaining to Berlin, but agreed that further discussions on Laos should be continued at the Foreign Minister level.
Summer 1961: Berlin Crisis
In July 1961, the Soviets threatened to take decisive action on Berlin. Kennedy warned that the United States would not tolerate any changes in Berlin's status. He activated 150,000 reservists, and advised the American people of the danger of an attack, possibly even a nuclear attack. Both leaders announced an increase in their defense expenditures. East Germans fled in large numbers to West Germany. On August 13, Khrushchev sealed off East Berlin from the West by erecting the Berlin Wall on Soviet-controlled territory.
October 18-29, 1962: Cuban Missile Crisis
After receiving intelligence that the Soviet Union was placing medium-range ballistic nuclear missiles in Cuba, on October 14, 1962, President Kennedy announced a naval quarantine of Cuba to block further Soviet missile deliveries, and demanded the removal or dismantling of the missiles already in Cuba. On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to stop work on the Cuban missile sites and to remove the missiles that were already in place. In return, the United States pledged not to follow through on its threat to invade Cuba.
June 1963: Establishment of the ""Hotline""
The United States and the Soviet Union signed a memorandum of understanding in Geneva in June 1963 to establish a direct communications link, or ""hotline,"" between the two governments for use in a crisis.
August 1963: Limited Test Ban Treaty
In August 1963, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty outlawing nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater.
October 1964: Fall of Khrushchev
Communist Party bureaucrats forced Khrushchev from power on October 14, 1964. Alexei Kosygin became Premier, and Leonid Brezhnev became First Secretary of the Communist Party.
March 1965: U.S. Troops to Vietnam
In March 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson committed the first U.S. combat ground troops to Vietnam to aid the South Vietnamese Government in its war against Soviet-assisted North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces.
January 1967: Treaty on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space
The United States and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on January 27, 1967. This agreement banned weapons of mass destruction from orbiting satellites, celestial bodies, or outer space.
June 1967: Johnson and Kosygin Meeting
Following Kosygin's visit to the United Nations, where he supported the Arab nations' proposals for ending the Middle East conflict in the aftermath of the June 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Johnson met with him in Glassboro, New Jersey that same month. The leaders discussed the Middle East, disarmament, and the Vietnam War. During the conference, the Soviet Union served as intermediary in conveying North Vietnamese willingness to negotiate in exchange for a halt to the U.S. bombing.
July 1968: Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
On July 1, 1968, sixty-two nations, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and encourage the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
August 1968: Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia
Soviet, Polish, East German, Bulgarian, and Hungarian troops invaded Czechoslovakia on August 20, 1968, and deposed the reformist government of Alexander Dubcek, who had begun a program of economic and political liberalization (the ""Prague spring""). The United States co-sponsored a UN Security Council resolution condemning the invasion and calling for the prompt withdrawal of Warsaw Pact forces; it also suspended a number of U.S.-Soviet exchange agreements and delayed ratification of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Brezhnev later justified the invasion with the assertion, known as the Brezhnev Doctrine, that when internal or external forces hostile to socialism sought to restore the capitalist order in any socialist state, all other socialist states had the right to intervene.
November 1969: Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
The United States and the Soviet Union held preliminary Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) in Helsinki on November 17, 1969. Formal SALT negotiations began in Vienna on April 16, 1970.
September-October 1969: Soviet Submarine Base in Cuba
In the fall of 1969, the United States protested the arrival of a Soviet flotilla and the construction of a Soviet submarine base at Cayo Alcatraz in the Bay of Cienfuegos, Cuba. After several diplomatic exchanges, Soviet Ambassador Anatoliy Dobrynin reaffirmed the 1962 understanding that Soviet offensive weapons would not be stationed in Cuba.
1970-1979
February 1971: Nuclear Weapons Ban on Seabed
Sixty-three nations signed a treaty banning emplacement of nuclear weapons on the seabed in February 1971. The United States and the Soviet Union had presented a draft of the treaty to the UN Committee on Disarmament in Geneva on October 7, 1969.
September 1971: Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin
The United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Great Britain signed the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin on September 3, 1971. They agreed to improvements in the Berlin situation, including unhindered movement of people and goods between the Western Sectors of Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany.
September 1971: Agreement to Reduce Risk of Nuclear War
The United States and the Soviet Union signed an Agreement on Measures to Reduce the Risk of Outbreak of Nuclear War on September 30, 1971. It provided for nuclear safeguards, immediate notification of an unexplained nuclear detonation, and advance notice of missile launches. They also agreed to improve the hotline.
May 1972: Moscow Summit
President Richard M. Nixon, the first U.S. President to travel to Moscow, met with Brezhnev on May 22-30, 1972. The leaders signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) Interim Agreement, both of which had been in negotiation in Helsinki and Vienna for many months. Nixon and Brezhnev also concluded agreements on public health; environmental cooperation; incidents at sea; exchanges in science, technology, education and culture; and a Declaration of Basic Principles of Mutual Relations.
June 1973: Brezhnev-Nixon Meeting in the United States
Brezhnev's visit to the United States resulted in 47 hours of meetings with Nixon in Washington, Camp David, and San Clemente from June 18-24, 1973. The two leaders signed nine accords, including an Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War and an Agreement on Basic Principles of Negotiations on the Further Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. Other agreements signed at the summit dealt with scientific cooperation, agriculture, trade, and other bilateral issues.

June-July 1974: Moscow Summit
The Watergate scandal and the President Nixon's imminent resignation overshadowed the Moscow Summit meeting in June and July, 1974, and limited expectations on both sides. Nixon and Brezhnev discussed arms control and several international and bilateral issues. They signed a protocol limiting each side to one ABM site apiece, instead of the two allowed in the 1972 ABM Treaty, and a Threshold Test Ban Treaty that limited the size of underground nuclear weapons tests. The United States never ratified the Test Ban Treaty because of concerns about its verifiability. The governments signed several other instruments addressing scientific cooperation, cultural exchanges, and other bilateral matters. Nixon and Brezhnev also agreed to explore the possibility of a 10-year time period for a SALT treaty, which opened the way for the Vladivostok accord a few months later. The communiqu� reaffirmed an agreement to hold regular meetings.

Ford and Brezhnev on November 23 and 24, 1974, focused on strategic arms limitations as well as on a number of bilateral and international issues, including the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Middle East. Ford and Brezhnev issued a joint statement on strategic offensive arms (the Vladivostok Agreement) and a joint communiqu� calling for continuing efforts at arms limitation and the development of economic cooperation. The Vladivostok accord provided some of the basic elements of the SALT II Treaty.

The State of Civil Society in Contemporary Russia
Thomas Adams, Coordinator of Assistance to Europe and Eurasia
Hillwood Museum
Washington, DC
June 13, 2007
As President Bush said in his remarks in Prague: ""Freedom is the best way to unleash the creativity and economic potential of a nation. Freedom is the only ordering of a society that leads to justice. And human freedom is the only way to achieve human rights."" The challenge for those of us working on Russia in the State Department is to weigh carefully the most effective way to use our diplomatic efforts and assistance resources to support Russia's civil society in its quest for a truly free and democratic society.
Our friendship with Russia is complex. We have many areas of cooperation with Russia as well as disagreements. Yet we cannot be silent about problems in Russia. We must raise our concerns with the Russians about troubling developments both at home and abroad. As we try to work together with the Russian government when we can, we also must push back whenever we have to. The trick is to find a way to work with Russia and not sacrifice our principles. We will not allow problems to prevent us from working on common interests.
On questions of civil society, the Russian government is neither neutral nor benign, as we've seen in the recent crackdowns at protests. Suppression of genuine opposition, abridgement of the right to protest, constriction of civil society, and the decline of media freedom are all serious setbacks. They are inconsistent with Russia's professed commitment to building and preserving the foundations of a democratic state. The State Department has publicly protested the recent police brutality employed to break up opposition marches in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Voronezh. The European Union also protested those actions. I would note that in the last few days opposition protests took place in St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Murmansk and faced little harassment.
Official Russia is not monolithic. Human Rights Ombudsman Lukin and Kremlin Civil Society Advisor Pamfilova criticized harsh treatment of protestors at Other Russia protests. They also criticized extreme measures against ethnic Georgians last fall, as did some other Russian officials.
We do not pull our punches with other countries. When human rights abuses occur, turning a blind eye is not the answer. It would be insulting to hold Russia to low standards. The Kremlin is not the only audience. Members of Russian civil society and opposition also count on our voice and our support of democratic principles. Our engagement can make a difference. This was clearly demonstrated when the Russian government modified the NGO law and ended its anti-Georgian measures in fall 2006. We view Russia and its people as our partners. Partnerships need communication; few relationships flower on silence.
So who is the champion of civil society in Russia? The United States? The EU? The international community writ large? I think the answer is the Russians themselves. Despite significant obstacles, civil society is very active in Russia -- you only need look at the thousands of NGOs and civil society groups in Russia, and groups such as the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers. These are home-grown groups that developed to address specific issues in society as they arise.
Our role, and the role of other donors who work with civil society in Russia, is to help bolster individuals and groups that are by no means helpless -- any of you who have worked with these folks in Russia know that they are an impressive and resilient group of people that won't be cowed -- but they absolutely need our support.
The new NGO law is an additional burden for civil society in Russia, but it has not (so far) interfered with the operations of many organizations. Yes, it makes their lives more difficult, but through our assistance we help NGOs monitor and analyze the effects of the law and better help them advocate for democracy.
One trend in civil society which I find extremely troubling is the shrinking pool in Russia of independent television and electronic media, which has fallen increasingly into state hands. The role of independent press is extremely important in a civil society -- people need access to independent information in order to hold their government accountable. And only through an independent press can that information be communicated.
A recent visit by a delegation of over 50 businesspeople from Russia really drove home to me the lack of access to independent information in Russia. Over the years I've met with various delegations of businesspeople brought together by this same organization, but their tone changed notably this year. This most recent delegation offered comments that made it clear that they were getting only one side of the story. The basic thrust of their questions was skewed, as they charged that internal developments in Eurasian countries were being driven by nefarious U.S. Government activity: the U.S. Government was interfering in Russia; the U.S. Government had bankrolled the Orange Revolution; the U.S. Government was supporting pro-Nazi Balts.
It's clear to me that we need to continue our support for independent media in Russia -- over 2,700 journalists have received professional training -- but we need to look for innovative ways to reach out to that sector more effectively. We will also need to take advantage of opportunities as they appear. As I already said, Russia is not a monolith. As we find democratic space in the regions, we must engage, working at the local level and even with some newly appointed governors in limited ways. In FY 2007 approximately $16 million will support NGO coalition building, think tanks, and advocacy groups and approximately $5.5 million will bolster the independence, ethical conduct, transparency, and professionalism of the justice system.
In addition to our regular bilateral assistance for Russiathe U.S.-Russia Investment Fund (TUSRIF) is now in the process of liquidating its holdings and will endow somewhere between $164 million and $320 million into a legacy foundation -- the U.S.-Russia Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law. This foundation focuses on advancing rule of law and democratic principles in Russia. Over $17 million in additional funds recovered from previous activities will support the Russian Civil Society Development Initiative to address challenges facing Russian NGOs. The Initiative will provide support for short-term needs stemming from efforts by the Russian government to exert more control over NGOs; and long-term development to strengthen NGO capacity and transparency, and their ability to reach out to large constituencies, build networks, and engage youth.
In the end, freedom will triumph in Russia. Not so much because of what we do, but because it is what the Russian people want.

HISTORY
According to State Department records, the first consul to Merida, Charles Thompson Jr., was confirmed on March 3, 1843. The opening of a U.S. Consulate was probably in response to the Mexican government’s decree, opening the ports of Sisal and Campeche to duty-free import and export. A consular agent was also maintained in Sisal, a busy port town that attracted many U.S. ships. Today, Sisal is a sleepy fishing village with a little more than 1,000 people.
From 1843 until 1897, ten consuls were appointed to represent the United States’ interests in the Yucatan. Most notable was Edward H. Thompson, the renowned archaeologist and explorer of the Mayan ruins at Chichén Itzá. Thompson was appointed consul by President Cleveland with the understanding that he would be given time away from his Consular duties to explore the Yucatan’s many ruins. His book “People of the Serpent” details his exhaustive research at Chichén Itzá and gives a brief summary of how he obtained his consular title.
In 1897, Consulate Merida was closed and the functions of the office were moved to Progreso. The Consulate remained in Progreso for 37 years. Records at the National Archives in Washington D.C. contain lists of dispatches the Consulate sent to Washington during this time. The business of those days concerned U.S. ships calling at the ports of Progreso and Campeche, agricultural and commercial aspects of the Yucatan, reports of missing Americans and reports of contagious diseases in the area.
The Consulate was moved back to Merida on February 1, 1934. The building was located near the “Parque del Centenario”. The Consulate was later moved to downtown Merida not far from the cathedral.
The U.S. government since 1959 leased the previous Consulate building, on Paseo de Montejo at Avenida Colon. The Consul and Vice Consul originally lived in homes located on the Consulate compound. In December of 2001, the lease expired on the property and a temporary extension was signed while an extensive search process for a new location was undertaken. Construction of the new Consulate was completed  and is a more secure and functional facility some three blocks from the previous site. The new office building opened for business on November 06, 2006 and is located at Calle 60 No. 338-K x 29 y 31, Col. Alcalá Martín, 97050.

81,81,US Refoulement to Russia: A Violation of the Prohibition against ...,https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/russia0307/3a.htm,20073-20073,"<<previous  |  index  |  next>>
US Refoulement to Russia: A Violation of the Prohibition against Torture
The prohibition against torture is absolute. War, national emergency, the imminent threat of terrorist attack—none may be invoked to justify torture.9 Many international declarations and treaties10  have repeated this prohibition, which finds its fullest articulation in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment.
The same absolute prohibition applies to sending people back to countries where they will be at risk of torture or ill-treatment.  The Convention against Torture forbids the “refoulement” of a person to countries “where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.”11  The US government reaffirmed that principle in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, which states in Section 1242, “It shall be the policy of the United States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States.”12  
Although the Bush administration has recently attempted (unsuccessfully) to redefine torture, it has not directly challenged this principle of nonrefoulement for torture. Instead, the US government has attempted to evade this important legal obligation by obtaining “diplomatic assurances” of humane treatment from governments with a record of torture.13 
Diplomatic Assurances
Particularly since the attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, the US and other governments have increasingly sought to return alleged terrorist suspects to countries where they face a risk of torture by obtaining from their governments “diplomatic assurances” that the suspects will be treated humanely back home. 
Diplomatic assurances take a variety of forms. Some are simply oral promises. Others are written documents, in some cases signed by officials of both governments. The content of the assurances also varies, and assurances against torture are sometimes packaged with other promises, such as a commitment to a fair trial. Some assurances do no more than reiterate that the receiving government will respect its domestic law or its obligations under international human rights law.
Governments that have transferred or tried to transfer suspects with such “assurances” include Austria, Canada, Georgia, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The receiving countries have included China, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Russia, Syria, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Yemen, all of which have well documented records of torture. The US government has been particularly eager to use such “assurances” as it begins to repatriate detainees from Guantanamo Bay.
Human Rights Watch opposes the use of “diplomatic assurances” in returning suspects to countries where they are at risk of torture. Governments that engage in torture routinely deny it and refuse to investigate allegations of torture.  A government that is already violating its international obligation not to torture cannot be trusted to abide by a further “assurance” that it will not torture.  This report provides evidence of precisely that fact, in the case of Russia.
The bankrupt nature of “diplomatic assurances” has received little attention in part because none of the governments involved want to admit to it.  The receiving countries deny that they practice torture and do not want to concede further that they broke a bilateral promise of humane treatment.  The sending countries, meanwhile, have no incentive to admit that the promises of humane treatment they received accomplished nothing and that they therefore violated their obligations under international law.
In response to a query from Human Rights Watch, the US government said in an email: “[T]he U.S. government has made clear on numerous occasions that it reviews humane treatment concerns relating to transfers out of Guantanamo and will not transfer an individual to a country where that individual is more likely than not to be tortured. Where necessary in order to address humane treatment concerns, the U.S. seeks assurances from the receiving government. This framework applied with respect to the transfer of the seven Russian nationals.” 14
Some sending governments have negotiated agreements to monitor the treatment of the suspects after they have been returned to their home countries.  Human Rights Watch has documented elsewhere that such monitoring agreements have not ensured humane treatment.15  Moreover, by its very nature, torture is practiced in secret, often using techniques that defy easy detection (for example, mock drowning, sexual assault, and psychological abuse).  In some countries medical personnel in detention facilities monitor the abuse to ensure that the torture is not easily detected.  And detainees subjected to torture are often afraid to complain to anyone for fear of reprisals against them or their family members.16 
Lack of confidentiality makes it virtually impossible to monitor an isolated detainee. If observers have access to all detainees in a facility, and are able to speak with detainees privately, a detainee can report an incident of abuse to them without fear that he or she will be identified by the authorities, and subject to reprisals. Such confidentiality cannot be provided when only one detainee or a small group is being monitored.
In the case of Russia, the US government appears to have made no attempt to either monitor or protest the inhumane treatment of the seven ex-Guantanamo detainees in Russia, despite the fact that it was aware of Russia’s pattern of abusive treatment.  US officials told Human Rights Watch in July 2006 that they were not making any effort to monitor the treatment of former Guantanamo detainees in Russia.17
Simply monitoring a detainee’s treatment after he returns home will not guarantee that he will not be tortured. But that does not mean the US government should simply ignore the fate of the detainees it has rendered to Russia.  Such has been its policy until now.  To protest the treatment of the detainees in Russia would certainly open the US government to charges of hypocrisy.  But the US failure to investigate and protest their ill-treatment means that the Russian government has so far felt no pressure, no spotlight, no brake of any kind on its abuse of the seven ex-Guantanamo detainees.  Although the US should never have returned the detainees to Russia in the first place, it ought to reverse course and seize the opportunity to protest their ill-treatment now. 
The Risk of Torture and Ill-Treatment in Russia
At the time these Russian citizens were sent back from Guantanamo, the US government was clearly aware that evidence of the risk of torture in Russia was abundant. The US State Department’s own human rights report for 2003, the most recent volume at the time of their refoulement, said about Russia, “There were credible reports that law enforcement personnel frequently engaged in torture, violence, and other brutal or humiliating treatment and often did so with impunity.”18 In June 2002, the United Nations Committee against Torture, the body responsible for monitoring state party compliance with the Convention against Torture, had voiced its strong concern at the “[n]umerous and consistent allegations of widespread torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of detainees committed by [Russia’s] law enforcement personnel, commonly with a view to obtaining confessions.”19 The Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited Russia in December 2001 and published its report about the continuing problem of torture on June 30, 2003, citing a “disturbing number of allegations of physical ill-treatment” by police.20 
In addition to governmental and intergovernmental sources of information about torture in Russia, international human rights groups have also written extensively about the widespread torture and mistreatment of criminal suspects in police custody in Russia.21 As Human Rights Watch reported in 1999, torture and ill-treatment of detainees generally occurs at the time of and immediately after arrest, often through police beatings, near-asphyxiations, and the application of electroshock in the pursuit of confessions or testimony incriminating others. Aside from a very few high-profile cases in which officers have been punished for such mistreatment, the Russian police carry out torture with almost complete impunity. Provincial and federal prosecutors close their eyes to evidence of abuse. The courts commonly accept forced confessions at face value, and use them as a basis for convictions. Despite overwhelming evidence that torture has become an integral part of police practice, the Russian government and law enforcement agencies generally—with some notable exceptions—deny that torture or ill-treatment is a problem, and are not taking any measures to end these abusive practices.22
Russia extensively used torture against Muslim detainees, especially Chechens accused of “terrorism,” before September 11. But the advent of the international “war on terror” appears to have hardened the Russian government’s treatment of such suspects. The Russian human rights organization Memorial stated in February 2006, “We have extensive evidence to suggest that under the pretext of fighting ‘Islamic extremism’ and ‘international terrorism,’ a large-scale campaign of persecution of Muslim followers of so-called ‘unconventional’ Islamic sects has been launched in Russia.”23 Memorial estimates that torture was used in more than 40 percent of the cases involving Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamist organization with an international presence that has been banned in Russia.24
Given the massive evidence about torture in Russia, it is virtually impossible to imagine that US officials were not cognizant of the risk that the Guantanamo detainees would be tortured, or that they did not understand the extent of the risk.
Two of the Russian detainees told Human Rights Watch that US interrogators at Guantanamo Bay were clearly aware that they would face torture and mistreatment back home.  Indeed, interrogators used the threat of return as a pressure tactic in interrogations: “The Americans … frightened us with return to Russia, [and] said that in Russia, we will be tortured,”25 Airat Vakhitov told Human Rights Watch. “There was constant blackmail,” Ravil Gumarov told Human Rights Watch. “They kept saying, ‘We’ll send you to Russia,’ that ‘They’ll string you up there’ and that kind of thing.”26
Rasul Kudaev told interviewers from Reprieve, the British human rights organization,
They said, “If you don’t tell us the truth, we’ll send you to Afghanistan, and if after Afghanistan anything is left of you, you will be sent to Russia where you will be tortured, you will have no fingers left.”27
Certainly the detainees themselves knew what probably awaited them if they were sent home. Most of them had had some dealings with Russian law enforcement before they went to Afghanistan, and a few of them had been seriously mistreated.  According to the mother of Ruslan Odizhev, for example, her son went to Afghanistan in part because he had been extensively tortured by Russian FSB (security service) officers in 2000 and did not think he could continue to live in Russia without danger to his physical well-being.28  Airat Vakhitov said he was beaten in 1999 while in detention for two months on suspicion of participating in illegal armed formations in Chechnya (he was never charged).  After that experience he decided to leave the country.  “I knew my life wouldn’t work out in Russia,” he told Human Rights Watch.29
The detainees themselves say they repeatedly asked US officials and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross at Guantanamo Bay not to be returned to Russia. “We all asked not to be returned to Russia because we were afraid of torture,” Airat Vakhitov told Human Rights Watch.30  Ravil Gumarov told Human Rights Watch, “We were asking to be sent to a third country, we didn’t want to go to Russia. We said it to the Red Cross too, that we wanted to go to a third country, any Islamic country. And we were saying it to the Americans, that we weren’t about to go back to Russia.” According to the detainees, both the US officials and the Red Cross said they could not influence the decision. “They said, ‘That’s all being decided at higher levels, we don’t know anything.’…  The Red Cross said, ‘We can’t do anything.’ Their hands were tied.”31 Shamil Khazhiev told Human Rights Watch, “All of us asked the Red Cross over and over again not to be sent back to Russia. I didn’t bother asking the Americans because it seemed useless.”32
Alexandra Zernova, a human rights activist working with Reprieve, interviewed six of the seven detainees33 in early October 2005.  She affirmed that all of them had told her they had not wanted to be sent back to Russia, and had told US officials so.34
According to the detainees, representatives of the Russian government who visited the detainees at Guantanamo told them they would certainly be sent back to Russia.  Airat Vakhitov said a senior investigator for the Procuracy General, Yuri Tkachev, visited him at Guantanamo and said, “We’re going to return you to Russia anyway. It’s going to be much worse for you there. We’re going to show you.”35  In contrast, however, Ravil Gumarov claimed that Tkachev told him he’d be better off in Russia, saying, “In America you’ll be in [prison] for life, in Russia we’ll give you a few years.”36
Vakhitov told Human Rights Watch that he continued trying to avoid being sent back to Russia right up until the last minute:
I asked the Red Cross for the last time just before our return to the homeland. I asked, “Are there any alternatives?” and they said no, and it would be better if we didn’t say that we didn’t want to go… [On February 28, 2004, the day the detainees were repatriated] I refused to go to the airport, and they [the Americans] brought in a stretcher to take me out.  But when I saw the stretcher, I agreed to go on my own.37

13 The US government has argued that, in respect of Guantanamo detainees, it is not bound by the nonrefoulement obligations of the Convention against Torture because Guantanamo Bay is not technically part of the territorial United States, an argument that has been rejected by the US Supreme Court.  But the US has also said that it has a policy of not returning aliens held overseas to torture, even though it argues that is not legally obligated not to do so under the Convention against Torture.

The Opening to China Part II: the Second Opium War, the United States, and the Treaty of Tianjin, 1857–1859
Following the First Opium War in the 1840s, the Western powers concluded a series of treaties with China in an effort to open its lucrative markets to Western trade. In the 1850s, the United States and the European powers grew increasingly dissatisfied with both the terms of their treaties with China and the Qing Government’s failure to adhere to them. The British forced the issue by attacking the Chinese port cities of Guangzhou and Tianjin in the Second Opium War. Under the most-favored-nation clause contained in the existing treaties, all of the foreign powers operating in China were permitted to seek the same concessions of China that Great Britain achieved by force. As a result, France, Russia, and the United States all signed treaties with China at Tianjin in quick succession in 1858.
Prince Gong, 1860 (Felice Beato, photographer)
These treaties granted the Western powers a number of rights and privileges. The number of treaty ports increased, with new ports opened to Western trade along the Chinese coast, on the islands of Taiwan and Hainan, and along the Yangtze River in the interior. With the opening of the Yangtze River, foreigners also gained full access to the interior, and were free to travel and conduct business or missions anywhere in China. The British demanded the right of Chinese citizens to emigrate on British ships. British (and therefore, French, American and Russian) diplomats were permitted to establish legations and live in Beijing. The agreements reached at Tianjin also set a new, low tariff for imported goods, giving foreign traders an important advantage. Frustrated by irregularities in Chinese customs services, British and U.S. merchants finally established the Imperial Maritime Customs Service, which regulated trade for the benefit of foreign merchants and provided a steady source of revenue to the Chinese Government.
Although the Chinese signed the treaties in 1858, it took two more years of fighting before the Chinese Government was disposed to ratify them and accept the terms. Noticing Chinese resistance to some of the principle clauses, in particular to the residence of foreign ambassadors in Beijing, the British continued their attacks on Chinese forts. Although the Chinese repulsed an attack on the Dagu forts in 1859, that one victory was not enough to stop the British forces from making their way north to Beijing. Joined by French forces, the British entered the city and burned the Summer Palace in the northwestern periphery, but spared the Forbidden City, home of the Chinese emperor.
While the British and French used military power to convince China to accept the new treaty agreements, U.S. diplomat John Ward sought, and finally achieved through diplomatic negotiations, an exchange of treaty ratifications in 1859. Under the most-favored-nation clause, the U.S. ratification allowed the other powers to take advantage of the treaty provisions of the Treaty of Tianjin secured by American diplomacy.
The agreements reached between the Western powers and China following the Opium Wars came to be known as the “unequal treaties” because in practice they gave foreigners privileged status and extracted concessions from the Chinese. Ironically, the Qing Government had fully supported the clauses on extraterritoriality and most-favored nation status in the first treaties in order to keep the foreigners in line. This treaty system also marked a new direction for Chinese contact with the outside world. For years, the Chinese had conducted their foreign policy through the tribute system, in which foreign powers wishing to trade with China were required first to bring a tribute to the emperor, acknowledging the superiority of Chinese culture and the ultimate authority of the Chinese ruler. Unlike China’s neighbors, the European powers ultimately refused to make these acknowledgements in order to trade, and they demanded instead that China adhere to Western diplomatic practices, such as the creation of treaties. Although the unequal treaties and the use of the most-favored-nation clause were effective in creating and maintaining open trade with China, both were also important factors in building animosity and resentment toward Western imperialism.

The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, adopted by General Assembly resolution 55/25 of 15 November 2000, is the main international instrument in the fight against transnational organized crime. It opened for signature by Member States at a High-level Political Conference convened for that purpose in Palermo, Italy, on 12-15 December 2000 and entered into force on 29 September 2003. The Convention is further supplemented by three Protocols, which target specific areas and manifestations of organized crime: the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air; and the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition. Countries must become parties to the Convention itself before they can become parties to any of the Protocols.
The Convention represents a major step forward in the fight against transnational organized crime and signifies the recognition by Member States of the seriousness of the problems posed by it, as well as the need to foster and enhance close international cooperation in order to tackle those problems. States that ratify this instrument commit themselves to taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime, including the creation of domestic criminal offences (participation in an organized criminal group, money laundering, corruption and obstruction of justice); the adoption of new and sweeping frameworks for extradition, mutual legal assistance and law enforcement cooperation; and the promotion of training and technical assistance for building or upgrading the necessary capacity of national authorities.
The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, was adopted by General Assembly resolution 55/25. It entered into force on 25 December 2003. It is the first global legally binding instrument with an agreed definition on trafficking in persons. The intention behind this definition is to facilitate convergence in national approaches with regard to the establishment of domestic criminal offences that would support efficient international cooperation in investigating and prosecuting trafficking in persons cases. An additional objective of the Protocol is to protect and assist the victims of trafficking in persons with full respect for their human rights.
The Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, adopted by General Assembly resolution 55/25, entered into force on 28 January 2004. It deals with the growing problem of organized criminal groups who smuggle migrants, often at high risk to the migrants and at great profit for the offenders. A major achievement of the Protocol was that, for the first time in a global international instrument, a definition of smuggling of migrants was developed and agreed upon. The Protocol aims at preventing and combating the smuggling of migrants, as well as promoting cooperation among States parties, while protecting the rights of smuggled migrants and preventing the worst forms of their exploitation which often characterize the smuggling process.
The Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition was adopted by General Assembly resolution 55/255 of 31 May 2001. It entered into force on 3 July 2005. The objective of the Protocol, which is the first legally binding instrument on small arms that has been adopted at the global level, is to promote, facilitate and strengthen cooperation among States Parties in order to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition. By ratifying the Protocol, States make a commitment to adopt a series of crime-control measures and implement in their domestic legal order three sets of normative provisions: the first one relates to the establishment of criminal offenses related to illegal manufacturing of, and trafficking in, firearms on the basis of the Protocol requirements and definitions; the second to a system of government authorizations or licensing intending to ensure legitimate manufacturing of, and trafficking in, firearms; and the third one to the marking and tracing of firearms.

The Opening to China Part I: the First Opium War, the United States, and the Treaty of Wangxia, 1839–1844
The Treaty of Wangxia (Wang-hsia) was the first formal treaty signed between the United States and China in 1844. It served as an American counterpart to the Anglo-Chinese Treaty of Nanjing that ended the First Opium War in 1842.
The Signing of the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842
The Opium War and these treaties were emblematic of an era in which Western powers tried to gain unfettered access to Chinese products and markets for European and U.S. trade.
Western traders, including those from the United States, had long sought a variety of Chinese products (including furniture, silk and tea), but found there were few products that China wanted from the West. American trade with China began as early as 1784, relying on North American exports such as furs, sandalwood, and ginseng, but American interest in Chinese products soon outstripped the Chinese appetite for these American exports. The British had already discovered a great market in southern China for smuggled opium, and American traders soon also turned to opium to supplement their exports to China. Beyond the health problems related to opium addiction, the increasing opium trade with the Western powers meant that for the first time, China imported more goods than it exported. Settling this financial problem eventually led to the First Opium War between Great Britain and China, from 1839 to 1842. After defeating the Chinese in a series of naval conflicts, the British were in a position to make a large number of demands from the weaker Qing Government of China, in the Anglo-Chinese Treaty of Nanjing. Not to be outdone, U.S. negotiators sought to conclude a similar treaty with the Chinese, to guarantee the United States many of the favorable terms awarded the British. The Chinese readily agreed in an effort to keep all foreigners on the same footing.
U.S. President John Tyler chose Massachusetts Congressman Caleb Cushing as his representative in treaty negotiations with the Chinese. Cushing and his counterparts reached the terms of the treaty quickly and signed it at Wangxia, a suburb of the Portuguese port city of Macau, in 1844. The Treaty of Wangxia replicated many of the key terms of the Treaty of Nanjing. Most importantly, it established five treaty ports as open for Chinese-Western trade (Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai). These treaty ports became key crossroads for Western and Chinese culture, as they were the first locations where foreigners and foreign trading operations could own land in China.
Massachusetts Congressman Caleb Cushing
The U.S. treaty was somewhat longer than the British version, as it included major points from the Treaty of Nanjing, but also added some issues of particular interest to the United States. Article 17 protected the interests of American missionaries in China (several had acted as translators during the negotiation process). Article 18 allowed Americans living or working in China to employ tutors to help them learn Chinese, a practice formerly forbidden by the Chinese Government. Unlike Great Britain, the United States agreed that anyone involved in the opium trade or the smuggling of contraband would be prosecuted under Chinese law, but, with that exception, the treaty allowed for other Americans in China to be afforded the benefits of extraterritoriality. This meant that any American accused of committing a crime in China would not be subject to the jurisdiction of the local law, but would instead be tried and, if necessary, punished by American officials in China. Due to the most-favored-nation clause in all of the western powers’ treaties with the Chinese Government, any special consideration given one power could ultimately be claimed by them all.
In the 1850s, the United States and the European powers grew increasingly dissatisfied with both the terms of their treaties with China, and the Qing Government’s failure to adhere to them. The British forced the issue by attacking the Chinese port cities of Guangzhou and Tianjin in the Second Opium War (1857–1858). Under the most-favored-nation clause, all of the foreign powers operating in China were permitted to seek the same concessions of China that Great Britain achieved by force. As a result, France, Russia, and the United States all signed treaties with China at Tianjin in quick succession in 1858.
The agreements reached between the Western powers and China following the Opium Wars came to be known as the “unequal treaties” because in practice they gave foreigners privileged status and extracted concessions from the Chinese. Ironically, the Qing Government had fully supported the clauses on extraterritoriality and most-favored nation status in the first treaties in order to keep the foreigners in line. This treaty system also marked a new direction for Chinese contact with the outside world. For years, the Chinese had conducted their foreign policy through the tribute system, in which foreign powers wishing to trade with China were required first to bring a tribute to the emperor, acknowledging the superiority of Chinese culture and the ultimate authority of the Chinese ruler. Unlike China’s neighbors, the European powers ultimately refused to make these acknowledgements in order to trade, and they demanded instead that China adhere to Western diplomatic practices, such as the creation of treaties. Although the unequal treaties and the use of the most-favored-nation clause were effective in creating and maintaining open trade with China, both were also important factors in building animosity and resentment toward Western imperialism.

More cases of polonium-210 contamination are uncovered in London
Owen Dyer
Author information Copyright and License information PMC Disclaimer
The investigation into the death of the former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko has uncovered further cases of contamination with the radioactive isotope polonium-210, and police believe that they are now close to identifying the suspected poisoners. But the chances of a criminal prosecution look slim in the face of a refusal from Russia to extradite any suspects named by British police.
Traces of polonium-210 were last week found at the Pescatori restaurant in Mayfair, while two more people tested positive for contamination with the substance, bringing the total to 12.
The UK Health Protection Agency, which is advising authorities on technical aspects of the case, characterises the contamination in all 12 cases as “not significant enough to result in any illness in the short term,” while “any increased risk in the long term is likely to be very small.” The Pescatori restaurant has been declared safe and has reopened for business.
One of the new cases involves a customer who attended the Pine Bar of the Millennium Hotel, Mayfair, on 1 November 2006, the day that Mr Litvinenko fell ill. Eight of the 12 people who have now shown signs of exposure to polonium-210 were workers at the hotel. A teacup at the hotel was also found to be contaminated.
The other new case involves a hotel worker at the Best Western Hotel in Piccadilly. One of three Russian men who met Mr Litvinenko at the Pine Bar had previously stayed there.
The other cases of contamination found to date are Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina, and a hotel worker at the Sheraton Park Lane Hotel. That hotel was also previously used by one of the men who met Mr Litvinenko at the Pine Bar.
Two of those men, the former KGB officer Andrei Lugovoi and former army officer Dmitri Kovtun, have tested positive for polonium-210 contamination in Moscow, and both have received medical treatment. Early reports that Mr Kovtun was in a coma later proved false.
Traces of the isotope have also been found on a passport photograph submitted by Mr Kovtun in a German residency application made before Mr Litvinenko's poisoning and on British Airways aircraft that fly the London-Moscow route.
Both Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi have been interviewed by British police in Russia, but Russian authorities have forbidden further interviews by British investigators. Moscow has also said that no Russian will be extradited, should Britain lay charges.
The two men deny involvement in Mr Litvinenko's death. So does the Russian government, describing a deathbed accusation of President Putin levelled by Mr Litvinenko as “nonsense.”
Fears of polonium-210 contamination have led thousands of people to contact the NHS Direct helpline, particularly after the news that small traces had been found on British Airways aircraft. However, none of the 1700 passengers who contacted the NHS showed signs of exposure. Most of the 250 people believed to have been at the Pine Bar on 1 November have been tested and cleared.
The Health Protection Agency is currently recommending that anyone who attended the Millennium Hotel's Pine Bar between 31 October 31 and 2 November should contact NHS Direct.

  Factsheet on U.S. – Russia WTO Bilateral Market Access Agreement
11/10/2006

The United States and Russia have reached agreement in principle on a bilateral market access deal in the context of Russia’s efforts to join the WTO, and are in the process of finalizing the details.  We hope to sign the Agreement in Hanoi on the margins of the APEC meetings next week.  Both sides are consulting with domestic constituencies on the results.
The Agreement:
•     Creates new market access opportunities for U.S. providers of goods and services to the Russian market.  It is a strong commercial agreement that should strengthen economic relations between our countries.
•     Addresses long-standing trade irritants between the two sides and puts our trade relations on a more cooperative course, particularly with respect to agriculture where our veterinary services will work closer together.
•     Sets the stage for an intensification of work in the multilateral phase of negotiations where the United States will work in close collaboration with Russia and other trading partners on Russia’s Protocol of Accession and Working Party Report.
•        Encourages greater transparency and a strengthening of the rule of law in Russia and fosters economic reform in Russia, which will improve the conditions for expanded commercial relations between our countries.
Highlights and Key Results:
Agriculture:
•     Russia is almost a $1 billion export market for U.S. agriculture products, and our largest export market for poultry. 
•     The 2003 Bilateral Meat Agreement, which covered beef, pork and poultry, will continue to be in force through 2009.  Our WTO Bilateral Market Access Agreement provides the framework for Russia’s post-2009 treatment of these key products in the WTO.
•     We also resolved long-standing issues that had impeded U.S. agricultural exports of beef, pork, poultry, and products of biotechnology.  These commitments take effect upon signature of the bilateral market access agreement.
•     The tariff commitments will benefit U.S. farmers, ranchers, and food processors of wheat, corn, barley, apples, pears, grapes, raisins, almonds, walnuts, pistachio nuts, dairy, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, pet food, pork, beef and poultry, among others, once Russia joins the WTO and we apply the agreement.
Industrial Goods:
•     Russia is currently a $2 to $3 billion market annually for U.S. industrial and consumer goods and is one of our fastest growing markets.
•     Russia agreed to cut tariffs on manufactured goods to an average of 8 percent.  Industrial goods important to the U.S. – Russian commercial relationship will realize even larger tariff cuts.  Sectors that will benefit from substantial tariff cuts include civil aircraft and parts, medical and scientific equipment, agriculture, power generation and construction equipment, information technology, and chemicals.
•     Russia also will establish a much more transparent system for the import of electronic goods with encryption, a major U.S. export, which permits a simple one-time notification of many products and sets specific ground rules for granting licenses for products that require an import license. We will be working with the Russian side on the details of this system.
Services:
•     Russia agreed to provide improved market access for U.S. service suppliers in a broad range of important sectors, including audiovisual, construction, distribution, express delivery, engineering, environmental, financial, telecommunications, fixed satellite, and business services. 
•     On banking and securities, Russia agreed to allow up to 100 percent foreign ownership of banks, broker dealers, and investment companies upon accession. 
•     On insurance, Russia will allow foreign insurance companies to operate through subsidiaries, including 100% foreign-owned non-life insurance companies, and branching after a transition period.
•     Russia retains the discretion to impose limits on new foreign direct investment in the banking and insurance sectors, if the ratio of foreign investment (excluding many investments) to total investment in the sector exceeds 50 percent.
Intellectual Property Rights:
•     Together we agreed to a binding blueprint for actions to address piracy and counterfeiting and improve protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights before Russia completes its accession to the WTO.  This agreement sets the stage for further progress with Russia on IPR issues through the next phase of multilateral WTO negotiations so that Russia will fully implement TRIPS upon accession. 
•     Russia has agreed to take specific actions, and to enact laws by specific dates, to fight optical disk piracy and internet piracy, and work to enact laws by specific dates to protect pharmaceutical test data, establish tougher criminal penalties for IP crimes, strengthen border enforcement, and bring its IPR legislation into line with international norms.  There are specific deadlines built into the agreement.
•     Russia has committed to fully implement the TRIPS Agreement and other IPR-related international agreements upon accession, and to ensure that any changes to its existing legislative regime for IPR, including those made in the context of Part IV of the Civil Code, do not reduce consistency with key international IPR standards.

  Factsheet on U.S. – Russia WTO Bilateral Market Access Agreement
11/10/2006

The United States and Russia have reached agreement in principle on a bilateral market access deal in the context of Russia’s efforts to join the WTO, and are in the process of finalizing the details.  We hope to sign the Agreement in Hanoi on the margins of the APEC meetings next week.  Both sides are consulting with domestic constituencies on the results.
The Agreement:
•     Creates new market access opportunities for U.S. providers of goods and services to the Russian market.  It is a strong commercial agreement that should strengthen economic relations between our countries.
•     Addresses long-standing trade irritants between the two sides and puts our trade relations on a more cooperative course, particularly with respect to agriculture where our veterinary services will work closer together.
•     Sets the stage for an intensification of work in the multilateral phase of negotiations where the United States will work in close collaboration with Russia and other trading partners on Russia’s Protocol of Accession and Working Party Report.
•        Encourages greater transparency and a strengthening of the rule of law in Russia and fosters economic reform in Russia, which will improve the conditions for expanded commercial relations between our countries.
Highlights and Key Results:
Agriculture:
•     Russia is almost a $1 billion export market for U.S. agriculture products, and our largest export market for poultry. 
•     The 2003 Bilateral Meat Agreement, which covered beef, pork and poultry, will continue to be in force through 2009.  Our WTO Bilateral Market Access Agreement provides the framework for Russia’s post-2009 treatment of these key products in the WTO.
•     We also resolved long-standing issues that had impeded U.S. agricultural exports of beef, pork, poultry, and products of biotechnology.  These commitments take effect upon signature of the bilateral market access agreement.
•     The tariff commitments will benefit U.S. farmers, ranchers, and food processors of wheat, corn, barley, apples, pears, grapes, raisins, almonds, walnuts, pistachio nuts, dairy, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, pet food, pork, beef and poultry, among others, once Russia joins the WTO and we apply the agreement.
Industrial Goods:
•     Russia is currently a $2 to $3 billion market annually for U.S. industrial and consumer goods and is one of our fastest growing markets.
•     Russia agreed to cut tariffs on manufactured goods to an average of 8 percent.  Industrial goods important to the U.S. – Russian commercial relationship will realize even larger tariff cuts.  Sectors that will benefit from substantial tariff cuts include civil aircraft and parts, medical and scientific equipment, agriculture, power generation and construction equipment, information technology, and chemicals.
•     Russia also will establish a much more transparent system for the import of electronic goods with encryption, a major U.S. export, which permits a simple one-time notification of many products and sets specific ground rules for granting licenses for products that require an import license. We will be working with the Russian side on the details of this system.
Services:
•     Russia agreed to provide improved market access for U.S. service suppliers in a broad range of important sectors, including audiovisual, construction, distribution, express delivery, engineering, environmental, financial, telecommunications, fixed satellite, and business services. 
•     On banking and securities, Russia agreed to allow up to 100 percent foreign ownership of banks, broker dealers, and investment companies upon accession. 
•     On insurance, Russia will allow foreign insurance companies to operate through subsidiaries, including 100% foreign-owned non-life insurance companies, and branching after a transition period.

Herpes Simplex Virus in the Newborn
Last Reviewed: October 2011
What is herpes simplex virus?
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a virus that usually causes skin infections. There are two types of HSV: HSV type 1 usually causes small blisters on the mouth, eye or lips (cold sores) and HSV type 2 usually affects the genital area. HSV infection in newborn babies can be very severe and can even cause death. This is because newborns' immune systems are not fully developed.
Who gets HSV and how is it spread?
About 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. are infected with HSV-1 and may shed virus in their saliva at any time during their lifetime, even if they don't have symptoms like sores in the mouth or cold sores.
Anyone can get either type of HSV. HSV-1 infection usually occurs in childhood, before age 5, from close contact with someone shedding HSV-1, often with cold sores.
Most HSV infections in newborns are caused by HSV-2 that the infant catches from the mother's birth canal.
Newborns can sometimes get HSV-1 from close contact with someone who is shedding HSV-1 virus in their saliva or has an active HSV-1 outbreak (cold sores).
What are the symptoms of HSV infection?
Most people with HSV-1 can shed it in their saliva with no symptoms, or they may have a cold sore: a small fluid filled skin blister which breaks open, crusts over, and disappears in about 21 days.
Infected newborns may have mild symptoms at first, such as low grade fever (100.4 degrees F., or more, rectally), poor feeding, or one or more small skin blisters. This can happen two to 12 days after HSV exposure. If any of these occur, notify your doctor immediately.
Newborns can become very sick quickly with high fever and seizures, and may become lethargic (floppy).
HSV infection in newborns can be very severe and can even cause death.
What is the treatment for HSV?
Cold sores in children and adults don't need to be treated. Creams with anti-HSV medicine can treat cold sore symptoms, if necessary.
Newborns with HSV require hospitalization for intravenous antiviral medication for 21 days. Even with this treatment, some newborns can suffer death or brain damage from HSV infection.
How can you prevent your newborn from getting HSV?
If you are pregnant and have a history or signs and symptoms of genital HSV-2 infection, tell your doctor as soon as possible. A C-section delivery is recommended if a mother has an HSV-2 outbreak near the time of birth.
Everyone should wash their hands before touching the newborn.
Do not kiss your baby or let others kiss your baby if you or they have cold sores on the mouth or lips.
Care instructions (recommendations for parents and caregivers):
Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching the newborn.
Contact your doctor immediately if there are any signs of HSV infection. These include low grade fever (100.4 degrees F., or more, rectally), poor feeding, irritability, and skin rash in the form of pimples or blisters, seizures or other similar symptoms that may develop within six weeks following birth.
All newborns should be seen by their health care provider between the first and third week of life.

International Institute of Social History
A World Ruled by Fear
Goldman was born in 1869 in Lithuania to a Russian-Jewish family of shopkeepers. She was educated in East Prussia and in St. Petersburg, where she moved with her family in 1881, months after the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldman lived in a world ruled by fear and the ubiquitous secret police, a world in which even the mildest expression of dissent would be summarily crushed. As a teenager, she began to embrace the ideas of the Russian revolutionary movement. The movement imagined a society of free equals, a tantalizing Utopia in which all problems could be solved on earth, by ordinary people. Its proponents were committed to removing a Czarist regime at any cost.
Disappointed by America
In 1885, Goldman emigrated to the United States. In America, her hopes outran the dreary reality of working in a Rochester clothing factory and a brief, unhappy marriage to a fellow worker. A year after her arrival, she was shocked by the trial, conviction, and execution of labor activists falsely accused of a bombing in Chicago's Haymarket Square. After their deaths, Goldman declared that America ""had proved most disappointing.""
Starting Over
In 1889, on a grimly hot day in August, Emma Goldman left her sister's family and her husband, and the clicking tongues of the Rochester Jewish community, and boarded a train for New York.
Budding Anarchist
In New York City, Goldman joined the German anarchist movement and met one of its leaders, the brilliant editor and orator Johann Most, who helped shape Goldman into a witty, provocative speaker. She also met the man who would become the most important and abiding person in her life, Alexander Berkman. Her commitment to Berkman was boundless, and in 1892, she became an accessory in Berkman's attempted assassination of steel magnate Henry Clay Frick in revenge for Frick's savage treatment of workers during the Homestead Steel Strike.
Revolution on the Russian Plan
Goldman and Berkman expressed an idea of revolutionary violence -- in the form of political assassination -- that derived from their Russian experiences. ""They do believe that by getting rid of Frick they'll ignite a revolution,"" commented historian Oz Frankel. ""But what neither of them have is a cultural translator, someone to explain to them the intricacies of this culture. They really don't understand that there is a difference between living in United States and living in Czarist Russia.""
Defending an Assassin
Goldman would be entangled in another act of political violence nine years after the attempt on Frick's life. In 1901 President William McKinley was assassinated by a self-proclaimed anarchist, Leon Zcolgosz, who said he was inspired by one of Goldman's lectures. Goldman came to Czolgosz's defense (although they had no previous connection), saying, ""As an anarchist, I am opposed to violence. But if the people want to do away with assassins, they must do away with the conditions which produce murderers."" Throughout her life, Goldman would oppose violence in theory, but defend it in practice by shifting the blame for acts of violence onto the state and governing classes.
Fame
While Berkman languished in prison for fourteen years for his crime, Goldman embarked on a career of public speaking, quickly rising to national attention through her relentless cross-country lecture tours.
A Biting Wit
Goldman's eloquence was legendary. ""She often began her lectures with a quick humorous quip about the police, or current politics,"" wrote historian Candace Falk, ""followed by a sweeping talk linked to contemporary issues that displayed her signature political and cultural critique of hypocrisy. ""Her intention was to reach a varied audience through reason and emotion, always ending her talks with a rousing articulation of a vision of hope for a better world within reach. After her formal lecture, during the question period, her biting wit often left the audience in stitches."" Goldman's anarchism was always part of her oratory. ""Revolutionary anarchism in America was largely an immigrant phenomenon,"" her biographer, Alice Wexler, wrote. ""Goldman hoped to Americanize anarchism by appealing to English-speaking audiences, especially to intellectuals.""
The Anarchists' Subculture
Goldman belonged to a unique and expressive subculture that flourished in America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Historian Leon Litwack described its members as ""some of the nation's most creative and iconoclastic artists, writers, and intellectuals, most of them libertarians, some of them revolutionaries,"" among them Roger Baldwin, Jack London, Sinclair Lewis, Theodore Dreiser, Henry Miller, Lincoln Steffens, Eugene Debs, ""Big Bill"" Haywood, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, John reed, Margaret Sanger and Eugene O'Neill. According to Litwack, they shared a ""rejection of bourgeois culture and... embrace of such causes as the labor movement, sexual freedom, feminism, socialism, and anarchism.""
Taking Up Unpopular Causes
From 1906-1917, Goldman published an influential anarchist magazine, Mother Earth, devoted to politics and literature. Its high-spirited prose, Goldman wrote, ""would voice without fear every unpopular cause."" One of her purposes in publishing an anarchist monthly, according to historian Dan Georgakas, was ""to reanimate an anarchist movement that had been on the defensive since the assassination of President William McKinley by an anarchist.""
Two Years in Prison
At the height of the Red Scare, Goldman and Berkman were imprisoned for opposing the draft during World War I. Goldman served two years at the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City. Berkman spent his prison sentence in Atlanta, Georgia.
Deported and Disillusioned
In December 1919, Goldman and Berkman were deported to Soviet Russia, just as the revolution there sank into an abyss of corruption and tyranny. After two agonizing years, Goldman and Berkman decided to leave Russia and alert the world to what they had witnessed. ""All my life I fed on the wonderful spirit of Russia,"" Goldman later wrote, ""then to have found it prostrate, kicked into the gutter, attacked on all sides, enduring tortures Dante's inferno did not contain. Above all, stabbed in the heart by its own friends. And then not to be able to help even a little bit ... but it was impossible.""
An Early Exposé of Soviet Communism
For Goldman the betrayal of the revolution was unspeakable. She wrote a series of articles for the New York World exposing the harsh political and economic conditions in Russia. Her account of her experiences in the new Soviet Union, , was, she said, ""denounced by American radicals of almost every camp."" Throughout the 1920s and 30s she continued her efforts to expose the Bolshevik regime as a reactionary dictatorship based on terrorism and persecution.
International Institute of Social History
Life in Exile
In exile, Goldman and Berkman eventually settled in France. Berkman lived in Nice, where he died in 1936. Goldman lived in St. Tropez, where she wrote her epic autobiography, Living My Life (1931). On its publication,  advised readers ""to pay less attention to Goldman's politics and to read the book as a human document of the most absorbing interest."" Not everyone agreed. Another critic attacked the memoir as a ""thousand dull pages of fornication and fanaticism.""
One Last Fight
Sixty-seven years old, Goldman turned her attention to one last fight -- a doomed war against fascism in Spain. In the summer of 1936, Spanish workers, peasants and anarchists had beaten back a military insurrection led by General Francisco Franco, and began to lay the cornerstones of a far-reaching anarchist society. Goldman made three visits to Spain during the course of the war, acting as publicist and fund-raiser for Spanish anarcho-syndicalists. But the anarchist revolution was short-lived. The victory of Franco and the Nationalist forces came as a staggering blow. Goldman later said the Spanish Civil War had influenced her more profoundly than her experience in Russia.
Final Return From Exile
In May 1940 Goldman died of a stroke in Toronto, Canada. Although she had been denied entry into the United States except for one brief visit in 1934, she was allowed in death to cross the border. She was buried in Chicago's Waldheim Cemetery, near the graves of the Haymarket martyrs.

Germans Reject Geneva Convention
Click here to copy a link to this section
From the very beginning, German policy on the treatment of Soviet prisoners of war (POWs) was determined by Nazi ideology. German political and military leaders regarded Soviet POWs not only as racially less valuable but as potential enemies, obstacles in the German conquest of ""living space."" The Nazi regime claimed that it was under no obligation for the humane care of prisoners of war from the Red Army
View This Term in the Glossary
because the Soviet Union had not ratified the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, nor had it specifically declared its commitment to the 1907 Hague Convention on the Rules of War. Technically both nations, therefore, were bound only by the general international law of war as it had developed in modern times. Yet even under that law, prisoners of war were to be protected.
Policy of Mass Starvation in the East
Click here to copy a link to this section
Soviet prisoners of war were the first victims of the Nazi policy of mass starvation in the east. In August 1941, the German army set a ration of just 2,200 calories per day for working Soviet prisoners of war. Even this was not enough to sustain life for long, but in practice the POWs received much less than the official ration. Many Soviet prisoners of war received at most a ration of only 700 calories a day. Within a few weeks the result of this ""subsistence"" ration, as the German army termed it, was death by starvation. The POWs were often provided, for example, only special ""Russian"" bread made from sugar beet husks and straw flour. Suffering from malnutrition and nearing starvation, numerous reports from the late summer and fall of 1941 show that in many camps the desperate POWs tried to ease their hunger by eating grass and leaves.
Epidemics
Click here to copy a link to this section
The Germans made little provision to shelter most of the prisoners they took from the Soviet military. Eventually the Germans established makeshift camps but the lack of proper food, clothing, and shelter took a terrible toll. Often the prisoners had to dig holes in the ground as improvised shelter from the elements. By the end of 1941, epidemics (especially typhoid and dysentery) emerged as the main cause of death. In October 1941 alone, almost 5,000 Soviet POWs died each day. The onset of winter accelerated the mass death of Soviet POWs, because so many had little or no protection from the cold.
Even in POW camps in Germany, Soviet POWs had often been left for months to vegetate in trenches, dugouts or sod houses. In the occupied eastern territories conditions were even worse. In Belorussia only pavilions (structures with roofs but no walls) were available to house Soviet POWs. By the winter of 1941, starvation and disease resulted in mass death of unimaginable proportions.
Many Soviet soldiers, including many wounded, died on the way to the prisoner collection centers and transit camps; others died during transit to camps in occupied Poland or the German Reich. Most of the prisoners captured in 1941 had to march to the rear across hundreds of miles and those who were too exhausted to continue were shot to death on the spot. When Soviet POWs were transported by train, the Armed Forces High Command permitted only open freight cars to be used. Sometimes days went by without the prisoners receiving any rations. This resulted in an enormous loss of life during winter months. According to army reports between 25 percent and 70 percent of the prisoners on these transports from the occupied Baltic countries died en route to Germany.
Mass Shootings
Click here to copy a link to this section
The large number of dead was due not just to irresponsible neglect by German officers but also to mass shootings. The Germans shot severely wounded Soviet soldiers to free the German army of their care. Time and again German forces were called upon to take ""energetic and ruthless action"" and ""use their arms"" unhesitatingly ""to wipe out any trace of resistance"" from Soviet POWs. Those attempting to escape were shot without warning. Moreover, a decree issued on September 8, 1941, stated that the use of arms against Soviet POWs was, ""as a rule, to be regarded as legal""—a clear invitation for German soldiers to kill Soviet POWs with impunity.
In the middle of July 1941, Gen. Hermann Reinecke, who was the officer in charge of prisoner-of-war affairs in the Armed Forces High Command, permitted security forces under the Reich Security Main Office to screen Soviet prisoners of war in the POW camps for ""politically and racially intolerable elements"" among the Soviet prisoners. These prisoners were transferred to SS jurisdiction and killed. This contributed to an enormous rise in the number of victims, since not only were ""all important state and party functionaries"" regarded as ""intolerable,"" but so were ""intellectuals,"" all ""fanatic Communists,"" and ""all Jews.""
Executions
Click here to copy a link to this section
The executions did not take place in the prisoner-of-war camps or their immediate area. Instead, prisoners were transferred to a secure area and shot. The concentration camps proved an ideal location for executions. In Gross-Rosen concentration camp, for example, the SS killed more than 65,000 Soviet POWS by feeding them only a thin soup of grass, water, and salt for six months. In Flossenbürg, SS men burned Soviet POWs alive. In Majdanek, they shot them in trenches. In Mauthausen, Austria, so many POWs were shot that the local population complained that their water supply had been contaminated. The rivers and streams near the camp ran red with blood. Estimates of the numbers of victims of this operation range from at least 140,000 up to 500,000.
Killing Centers
Click here to copy a link to this section
The Auschwitz-Birkenau and Majdanek camps had originally been constructed for the Soviet POWs that Heinrich Himmler had claimed for himself. The POWs were to be put to work in the huge industrial conglomerates that the SS was planning to set up together with firms such as I.G. Farben. But in January 1942, only a few hundred of the Soviet prisoners who had originally been brought to Auschwitz—out of a total of 10,000—were still alive, and no further influx was expected. For this reason Himmler decided, in the week following the Wannsee Conference, to fill the camps with 150,000 Jews. In this manner the SS camps for POWs became part of the infrastructure for the murder of the Jews.
It was when dealing with Soviet POWs at Auschwitz that camp commandant Rudolf Hoess and his assistants experimented with the means of killing that has since become the symbol of Nazi genocide: Zyklon B.
View This Term in the Glossary
In early September 1941, 600 Soviet POWs were selected for execution. Hoess decided to gas them with Zyklon B, also known as hydrogen cyanide, in the Auschwitz I gas chamber. The experimental gassing here also included 250 inmates who had been designated unfit for work. The Nazis had already experimented with gassing as the means to kill people they considered disabled beginning in October 1939. A method was thereby found that would kill millions of people with minimal effort. Those lessons were subsequently applied first to Soviet POWs and then to Jews. By February 1942, 2,000,000 of the 3,300,000 Soviet soldiers in German custody up to that point had died from starvation, exposure, disease, or shooting.

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
Compare and contrast the treatment of Soviet POWs and captured soldiers of other enemies by the Nazi military.
What international agreements govern treatment of POWs? How have they changed since the end of World War II?
Do these agreements and regulations apply to fighters not aligned with a particular country or its military? How have modern nations responded to this circumstance?

VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers of Global Power
A. Summary of National Security Strategy 2002
Relations with the most powerful countries in the world are central to our national security strategy. Our priority is pursuing American interests within cooperative relationships, particularly with our oldest and closest friends and allies. At the same time, we must seize the opportunity – unusual in historical terms – of an absence of fundamental conflict between the great powers. Another priority, therefore, is preventing the reemergence of the great power rivalries that divided the world in previous eras. New times demand new approaches, flexible enough to permit effective action even when there are reasonable differences of opinions among friends, yet strong enough to confront the challenges the world faces.
B. Current Context: Successes and Challenges
The United States has enjoyed unprecedented levels of cooperation on many of its highest national security priorities:
The global coalition against terror has grown and deepened, with extensive cooperation and common resolve. The nations that have partnered with us in Afghanistan and Iraq have developed capabilities that can be applied to other challenges.
We have joined with other nations around the world as well as numerous multilateral organizations to improve the capability of all nations to defend their homelands against terrorists and transnational criminals.
We have achieved extraordinary coordination among historic rivals in pressing the DPRK to abandon its nuclear program.
We have partnered with European allies and international institutions to pressure Iran to honor its non-proliferation commitments.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is transforming itself to meet current threats and is playing a leading role in stabilizing the Balkans and Afghanistan, as well as training the Iraqi military leadership to address its security challenges.
We have set aside decades of mistrust and put relations with India, the world’s most populous democracy, on a new and fruitful path.
At the same time, America’s relations with other nations have been strong enough to withstand differences and candid exchanges of views.
Some of our oldest and closest friends disagreed with U.S. policy in Iraq. There are ongoing and serious debates with our allies about how best to address the unique and evolving nature of the global terrorist threat.
We have disagreed on the steps to reduce agricultural subsidies and achieve success in the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations. We have also faced challenges in forging consensus with other major nations on the most effective measures to protect the environment.
C. The Way Ahead
The struggle against militant Islamic radicalism is the great ideological conflict of the early years of the 21st century and finds the great powers all on the same side – opposing the terrorists. This circumstance differs profoundly from the ideological struggles of the 20th century, which saw the great powers divided by ideology as well as by national interest.
The potential for great power consensus presents the United States with an extraordinary opportunity. Yet certain challenges must be overcome. Some nations differ with us on the appropriate pace of change. Other nations provide rhetorical support for free markets and effective democracy but little action on freedom’s behalf.
Five principles undergird our strategy for relations with the main centers of global power.
First, these relations must be set in their proper context. Bilateral policies that ignore regional and global realities are unlikely to succeed.
Second, these relations must be supported by appropriate institutions, regional and global, to make cooperation more permanent, effective, and wide-reaching. Where existing institutions can be reformed to meet new challenges, we, along with our partners, must reform them. Where appropriate institutions do not exist, we, along with our partners, must create them.
Third, we cannot pretend that our interests are unaffected by states’ treatment of their own citizens. America’s interest in promoting effective democracies rests on an historical fact: states that are governed well are most inclined to behave well. We will encourage all our partners to expand liberty, and to respect the rule of law and the dignity of the individual, as the surest way to advance the welfare of their people and to cement close relations with the United States.
Fourth, while we do not seek to dictate to other states the choices they make, we do seek to influence the calculations on which these choices are based. We also must hedge appropriately in case states choose unwisely.
Fifth, we must be prepared to act alone if necessary, while recognizing that there is little of lasting consequence that we can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of our allies and partners.
1. The Western Hemisphere
These principles guide our relations within our own Hemisphere, the frontline of defense of American national security. Our goal remains a hemisphere fully democratic, bound together by good will, security cooperation, and the opportunity for all our citizens to prosper. Tyrants and those who would follow them belong to a different era and must not be allowed to reverse the progress of the last two decades. Countries in the Hemisphere must be helped to the path of sustained political and economic development. The deceptive appeal of anti-free market populism must not be allowed to erode political freedoms and trap the Hemisphere’s poorest in cycles of poverty. If America’s nearest neighbors are not secure and stable, then Americans will be less secure.
Our strategy for the Hemisphere begins with deepening key relationships with Canada and Mexico, a foundation of shared values and cooperative policies that can be extended throughout the region. We must continue to work with our neighbors in the Hemisphere to reduce illegal immigration and promote expanded economic opportunity for marginalized populations. We must also solidify strategic relationships with regional leaders in Central and South America and the Caribbean who are deepening their commitment to democratic values. And we must continue to work with regional partners to make multilateral institutions like the OAS and the Inter-American Development Bank more effective and better able to foster concerted action to address threats that may arise to the region’s stability, security, prosperity, or democratic progress. Together, these partnerships can advance our four strategic priorities for the region: bolstering security, strengthening democratic institutions, promoting prosperity, and investing in people.
2. Africa
Africa holds growing geo-strategic importance and is a high priority of this Administration. It is a place of promise and opportunity, linked to the United States by history, culture, commerce, and strategic significance. Our goal is an African continent that knows liberty, peace, stability, and increasing prosperity.
Africa’s potential has in the past been held hostage by the bitter legacy of colonial misrule and bad choices by some African leaders. The United States recognizes that our security depends upon partnering with Africans to strengthen fragile and failing states and bring ungoverned areas under the control of effective democracies.
Overcoming the challenges Africa faces requires partnership, not paternalism. Our strategy is to promote economic development and the expansion of effective, democratic governance so that African states can take the lead in addressing African challenges. Through improved governance, reduced corruption, and market reforms, African nations can lift themselves toward a better future. We are committed to working with African nations to strengthen their domestic capabilities and the regional capacity of the AU to support post-conflict transformations, consolidate democratic transitions, and improve peacekeeping and disaster responses.
3. Middle East
The Broader Middle East continues to command the world’s attention. For too long, too many nations of the Middle East have suffered from a freedom deficit. Repression has fostered corruption, imbalanced or stagnant economies, political resentments, regional conflicts, and religious extremism. These maladies were all cloaked by an illusion of stability. Yet the peoples of the Middle East share the same desires as people in the rest of the world: liberty, opportunity, justice, order, and peace. These desires are now being expressed in movements for reform. The United States is committed to supporting the efforts of reformers to realize a better life for themselves and their region.
We seek a Middle East of independent states, at peace with each other, and fully participating in an open global market of goods, services, and ideas. We are seeking to build a framework that will allow Israel and the Palestinian territories to live side by side in peace and security as two democratic states. In the wider region, we will continue to support efforts for reform and freedom in traditional allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Tyrannical regimes such as Iran and Syria that oppress at home and sponsor terrorism abroad know that we will continue to stand with their people against their misrule. And in Iraq, we will continue to support the Iraqi people and their historic march from tyranny to effective democracy. We will work with the freely elected, democratic government of Iraq – our new partner in the War on Terror – to consolidate and expand freedom, and to build security and lasting stability.
4. Europe
The NATO remains a vital pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The Alliance has been strengthened by expanding its membership and now acts beyond its borders as an instrument for peace and stability in many parts of the world. It has also established partnerships with other key European states, including Russia, Ukraine, and others, further extending NATO's historic transformation. The internal reform of NATO structures, capabilities, and procedures must be accelerated to ensure that NATO is able to carry out its missions effectively. The Alliance’s door will also remain open to those countries that aspire for membership and meet NATO standards. Further, NATO must deepen working relationships between and across institutions, as it is doing with the EU, and as it also could do with new institutions. Such relationships offer opportunities for enhancing the distinctive strengths and missions of each organization.
Europe is home to some of our oldest and closest allies. Our cooperative relations are built on a sure foundation of shared values and interests. This foundation is expanding and deepening with the ongoing spread of effective democracies in Europe, and must expand and deepen still further if we are to reach the goal of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. These democracies are effective partners, joining with us to promote global freedom and prosperity. Just as in the special relationship that binds us to the United Kingdom, these cooperative relationships forge deeper ties between our nations.
5. Russia
The United States seeks to work closely with Russia on strategic issues of common interest and to manage issues on which we have differing interests. By reason of geography and power, Russia has great influence not only in Europe and its own immediate neighborhood, but also in many other regions of vital interest to us: the broader Middle East, South and Central Asia, and East Asia. We must encourage Russia to respect the values of freedom and democracy at home and not to impede the cause of freedom and democracy in these regions. Strengthening our relationship will depend on the policies, foreign and domestic, that Russia adopts. Recent trends regrettably point toward a diminishing commitment to democratic freedoms and institutions. We will work to try to persuade the Russian Government to move forward, not backward, along freedom’s path.
Stability and prosperity in Russia’s neighborhood will help deepen our relations with Russia; but that stability will remain elusive as long as this region is not governed by effective democracies. We will seek to persuade Russia’s government that democratic progress in Russia and its region benefits the peoples who live there and improves relationships with us, with other Western governments, and among themselves. Conversely, efforts to prevent democratic development at home and abroad will hamper the development of Russia’s relations with the United States, Europe, and its neighbors.
6. South and Central Asia
South and Central Asia is a region of great strategic importance where American interests and values are engaged as never before. India is a great democracy, and our shared values are the foundation of our good relations. We are eager to see Pakistan move along a stable, secure, and democratic path. Our goal is for the entire region of South and Central Asia to be democratic, prosperous, and at peace.
We have made great strides in transforming America’s relationship with India, a major power that shares our commitment to freedom, democracy, and rule of law. In July 2005, we signed a bold agreement – a roadmap to realize the meaningful cooperation that had eluded our two nations for decades. India now is poised to shoulder global obligations in cooperation with the United States in a way befitting a major power.
Progress with India has been achieved even as the United States has improved its strategic relationship with Pakistan. For decades, outsiders acted as if good relations with India and Pakistan were mutually exclusive. This Administration has shown that improved relations with each are possible and can help India and Pakistan make strides toward a lasting peace between themselves. America’s relationship with Pakistan will not be a mirror image of our relationship with India. Together, our relations with the nations of South Asia can serve as a foundation for deeper engagement throughout Central Asia. Increasingly, Afghanistan will assume its historical role as a land-bridge between South and Central Asia, connecting these two vital regions.
Central Asia is an enduring priority for our foreign policy. The five countries of Central Asia are distinct from one another and our relations with each, while important, will differ. In the region as a whole, the elements of our larger strategy meet, and we must pursue those elements simultaneously: promoting effective democracies and the expansion of free-market reforms, diversifying global sources of energy, and enhancing security and winning the War on Terror.
7. East Asia
East Asia is a region of great opportunities and lingering tensions. Over the past decade, it has been a source of extraordinary economic dynamism and also of economic turbulence. Few regional economies have more effectively harnessed the engines of future prosperity: technology and globalized trade. Yet few regions have had greater difficulty overcoming the suspicions of the past.
The United States is a Pacific nation, with extensive interests throughout East and Southeast Asia. The region’s stability and prosperity depend on our sustained engagement: maintaining robust partnerships supported by a forward defense posture supporting economic integration through expanded trade and investment and promoting democracy and human rights.
Forging new international initiatives and institutions can assist in the spread of freedom, prosperity, and regional security. Existing institutions like the APEC forum and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum, can play a vital role. New arrangements, such as the U.S.-ASEAN Enhanced Partnership, or others that are focused on problem-solving and action, like the Six-Party Talks and the PSI, can likewise bring together Asian nations to address common challenges. And Asian nations that share our values can join us in partnership to strengthen new democracies and promote democratic reforms throughout the region. This institutional framework, however, must be built upon a foundation of sound bilateral relations with key states in the region.
With Japan, the United States enjoys the closest relations in a generation. As the world’s two largest economies and aid donors, acting in concert multiplies each of our strengths and magnifies our combined contributions to global progress. Our shared commitment to democracy at home offers a sure foundation for cooperation abroad.
With Australia, our alliance is global in scope. From Iraq and Afghanistan to our historic FTA, we are working jointly to ensure security, prosperity, and expanded liberty.
With the ROK, we share a vision of a prosperous, democratic, and united Korean peninsula. We also share a commitment to democracy at home and progress abroad and are translating that common vision into joint action to sustain our alliance into the 21st century. With Southeast Asia, we celebrate the dynamism of increased economic freedom and look to further extend political freedom to all the people in the region, including those suffering under the repressive regime in Burma. In promoting greater economic and political liberty, we will work closely with our allies and key friends, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
China encapsulates Asia’s dramatic economic successes, but China’s transition remains incomplete. In one generation, China has gone from poverty and isolation to growing integration into the international economic system. China once opposed global institutions; today it is a permanent member of the UNSC and the WTO. As China becomes a global player, it must act as a responsible stakeholder that fulfills its obligations and works with the United States and others to advance the international system that has enabled its success: enforcing the international rules that have helped China lift itself out of a century of economic deprivation, embracing the economic and political standards that go along with that system of rules, and contributing to international stability and security by working with the United States and other major powers.
China’s leaders proclaim that they have made a decision to walk the transformative path of peaceful development. If China keeps this commitment, the United States will welcome the emergence of a China that is peaceful and prosperous and that cooperates with us to address common challenges and mutual interests. China can make an important contribution to global prosperity and ensure its own prosperity for the longer term if it will rely more on domestic demand and less on global trade imbalances to drive its economic growth. China shares our exposure to the challenges of globalization and other transnational concerns. Mutual interests can guide our cooperation on issues such as terrorism, proliferation, and energy security. We will work to increase our cooperation to combat disease pandemics and reverse environmental degradation.
The United States encourages China to continue down the road of reform and openness, because in this way China’s leaders can meet the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Chinese people for liberty, stability, and prosperity. As economic growth continues, China will face a growing demand from its own people to follow the path of East Asia’s many modern democracies, adding political freedom to economic freedom. Continuing along this path will contribute to regional and international security.
China’s leaders must realize, however, that they cannot stay on this peaceful path while holding on to old ways of thinking and acting that exacerbate concerns throughout the region and the world. These old ways include:
Continuing China’s military expansion in a non-transparent way;
Expanding trade, but acting as if they can somehow “lock up” energy supplies around the world or seek to direct markets rather than opening them up – as if they can follow a mercantilism borrowed from a discredited era; and
Supporting resource-rich countries without regard to the misrule at home or misbehavior abroad of those regimes.
China and Taiwan must also resolve their differences peacefully, without coercion and without unilateral action by either China or Taiwan.
Ultimately, China’s leaders must see that they cannot let their population increasingly experience the freedoms to buy, sell, and produce, while denying them the rights to assemble, speak, and worship. Only by allowing the Chinese people to enjoy these basic freedoms and universal rights can China honor its own constitution and international commitments and reach its full potential. Our strategy seeks to encourage China to make the right strategic choices for its people, while we hedge against other possibilities.

Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies
The Outer Space Treaty was considered by the Legal Subcommittee in 1966 and agreement was reached in the General Assembly in the same year ( resolution 2222 (XXI)). The Treaty was largely based on the Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, which had been adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 1962 (XVIII) in 1963, but added a few new provisions. The Treaty was opened for signature by the three depository Governments (the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) in January 1967, and it entered into force in October 1967. The Outer Space Treaty provides the basic framework on international space law, including the following principles:
the exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and shall be the province of all mankind;
outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all States;
outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means;
States shall not place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies or station them in outer space in any other manner;
the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes;
astronauts shall be regarded as the envoys of mankind;
States shall be responsible for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities;
States shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects; and
States shall avoid harmful contamination of space and celestial bodies.

Social Security and entering the United States of America
Whether you are a student or a teacher, a farm worker or a businessperson, a refugee or a temporary resident, if you are an immigrant and you need to do business with Social Security, you have come to the right place.
If English is not easy for you
We can help you in two ways:
You can find out about the Social Security program by reading information in one of the 14 languages offered on our Multilanguage Gateway; and
We can provide an interpreter for you when you call or visit Social Security. Read If You Need An Interpreter to find out how we can help you when you contact us.
Getting a Social Security card
To work in the United States, you will need a Social Security card that has your Social Security number. You can find general information about Social Security cards by reading our online publication, Social Security Numbers For Non-Citizens.
There are several ways to get a Social Security card:
The easiest way is to apply for a card as part of the immigration process in your home country before you come to the United States. You can do this when filing an application for an immigrant visa with the U.S. Department of State. For information on how to use this process, read Social Security Numbers And Immigrant Visas.
If you did not get a Social Security card as part of the immigration process, read New Or Replacement Social Security Number Card to find out how to get one in the United States.
If you are lawfully present in the United States and plan to apply for work authorization, you can apply for both work authorization from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and request a Social Security card from Social Security at the same time. For more information on this process, read Apply For Your Social Security Number While Applying Your Work Permit.
We are with those who need a helping hand...
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a program that provides income support to people with disabilities and people who are age 65 or older, or blind, who have low income and resources. U.S. Treasury general funds, not the Social Security trust funds, pay for SSI.
If you or someone you know may be eligible for SSI, visit SSI Benefits to learn more and apply.

Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS)
What is hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome?
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses from the family Bunyaviridae. HFRS includes diseases such as Korean hemorrhagic fever, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, and nephropathia epidemica. The viruses that cause HFRS include Hantaan, Dobrava, Saaremaa, Seoul, and Puumala.
Where is HFRS found?
HFRS is found throughout the world. Haantan virus is widely distributed in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and Korea. Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and western Russia. Dobrava virus is found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul virus is found worldwide. Saaremaa is found in central Europe and Scandinavia. In the Americas, hantaviruses cause a different disease known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
How do humans get HFRS?
Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents. People can become infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after exposure to dust from their nests. Transmission may also occur when infected urine or these other materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. In addition, individuals who work with live rodents can be exposed to hantaviruses through rodent bites from infected animals. Transmission from one human to another may occur, but is extremely rare.
Which rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HFRS in humans?
Rodents are the natural reservoir for hantaviruses. Known carriers include the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), the reservoir for both the Saaremaa and Hantaan virus; the brown or Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), the reservoir for Seoul virus; the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), the reservoir for Puumala virus; and the yellow-necked field mouse (Apodemus flavicollis), which carries Dobrava virus.
What are the symptoms of HFRS?
Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to infectious material, but in rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to develop. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include intense headaches, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision. Individuals may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include low blood pressure, acute shock, vascular leakage, and acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload. The severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus causing the infection. Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections usually cause severe symptoms, while Seoul, Saaremaa, and Puumala virus infections are usually more moderate. Complete recovery can take weeks or months.
How is HFRS diagnosed?
Several laboratory tests are used to confirm a diagnosis of HFRS in patients with a clinical history compatible with the disease. Such patients are determined to have HFRS if they have serologic test results positive for hantavirus infection, evidence of hantavirus antigen in tissue by immunohistochemical staining and microscope examination, or evidence of hantavirus RNA sequences in blood or tissue.
How is HFRS treated?
Supportive therapy is the mainstay of care for patients with hantavirus infections. Care includes careful management of the patient’s fluid (hydration) and electrolyte (e.g., sodium, potassium, chloride) levels, maintenance of correct oxygen and blood pressure levels, and appropriate treatment of any secondary infections. Dialysis may be required to correct severe fluid overload. Intravenous ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been shown to decrease illness and death associated with HFRS if used very early in the disease.
Is HFRS ever fatal?
Depending upon which virus is causing the HFRS, death occurs in less than 1% to as many as 15% of patients. Fatality ranges from 5-15% for HFRS caused by Hantaan virus, and it is less than 1% for disease caused by Puumala virus.
How is HFRS prevented?
Rodent control is the primary strategy for preventing hantavirus infections. Rodent populations near human communities should be controlled, and rodents should be excluded from homes. Individuals should avoid contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials, and the safety measures described below should be followed when cleaning rodent-infested areas.
Outbreak of Seoul Virus in the United States and Canada in 2017
CDC assisted health officials in investigating an outbreak of Seoul virus infection that infected 17 people and found 31 infected ratteries in 11 states, which included Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. Investigations by CDC and partnering state and local health departments indicated that potentially infected rodents could have been distributed or received in Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin.
The investigation included testing of rats and humans. In addition to testing provided by CDC for rats and people linked to ratteries with confirmed infections, commercial testing for rats was also available. In an initial evaluation, the test kits developed by the commercial laboratories IDEXX and Charles River laboratories* yielded test results with similar accuracy to those of the CDC test.
As part of a health monitoring program, rat owners and breeders may wish to test to know a rat’s infection status prior to admitting new animals into existing colonies.
