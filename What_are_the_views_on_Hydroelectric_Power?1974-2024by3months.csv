As Ukraine grapples with a myriad of environmental challenges, one issue has become the center of debate due to its complexity and the polarized views it has generated: the question of whether the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant (HPP) should be rebuilt.
Once a vital source of water and energy, the Kakhovka HPP now stands in ruins after its destruction. The debate revolves around two different points of view – the state, farmers, and energy companies, on the one hand, advocate for rebuilding the HPP, and ecologists, on the other hand, push for the restoration of the natural and historical landscape of the Velykyi Luh.
In this column, I want to delve into these two perspectives, analyzing in detail all the arguments that ecologists, government officials, and farmers put forward. I do not intend to take sides in this debate. Instead, I want to offer readers a balanced view of the situation, enabling them to form opinions based on presented information.

In Favor: The Energy perspective
On July 18, 2023, the government adopted a resolution on a pilot project to start rebuilding the Kakhovka HPP, reconstruct it after its destruction, and ensure the stable operation of the Dnipro HPP during this reconstruction. It consists of two stages.
Government officials and farmers emphasize that the destruction of the Kakhovka HPP wreaked havoc on the nation's economy and the environment of the surrounding regions. As a result, the irrigation systems of 5,800 square kilometers (3,600 square miles) of agricultural land were left without water supply, disrupting the production of about two million tons of grain per year. Industrial enterprises in the regions also suffer from water shortages. The country has lost 335 MW of renewable electricity capacity. In addition, the full resumption of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) operation after the plant de-occupation is impossible without the Kakhovka reservoir restoration.

Poland Mulling ‘Temporary’ Border Closure with Ukraine for Goods
Poland's ties with Ukraine have become increasingly strained over border blockades, with at least four incidents of Polish farmers spilling Ukrainian grain from lorries and freight trains.
The project’s first stage involves the design and construction of specific structures necessary for the stable operation of the Dnipro HPP during further restoration work at the Kakhovka HPP. The second stage involves the design and work directly on the de-occupied territory.

Power engineers emphasize that the importance of the Kakhovka HPP goes beyond energy production. It is crucial for covering the water shortage in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipro regions, which depended on supplies from the Kakhovka reservoir. The HPP also fed the irrigation system and supplied water to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. It also ensured the Dnipro River’s navigation, whose depth has significantly dwindled now.
The Kakhovka HPP plays a vital role in balancing green energy. Mykolaiv, Kherson, partly Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia regions have the most sunny days in Ukraine and are the windiest areas, making them ideal for green energy development. However, wind and solar power plant production is poorly predictable and must be balanced with traditional generation sources like thermal or hydroelectric power plants.
The absence of the Kakhovka HPP has impacted the efficiency of the entire Dnipro cascade of power plants. Currently, the Dnipro HPP is operating with restrictions due to insufficient water levels.

The project’s second stage proposes the construction of a temporary dam at the Kakhovka HPP site after the plant de-occupation. This hydraulic structure will get the reservoir restoration started.
According to farmers, if the hydroelectric power plant is not restored, the territory of the former Kakhovka reservoir will not return to its natural state but will turn into a wetland, posing additional environmental challenges.
Thus, supporters of the restoration of the Kakhovka HPP emphasize that it is not only about energy production, but also about water supply, green energy balance, and environmental degradation prevention.
AGAINST: The Environmental perspective
The Ukrainian Environmental Protection Group, an NGO established in 2014, presents an opposing position to the government's position on the Kakhovka HPP rebuilding. They argue that it would be more socially, environmentally, and economically beneficial for Ukraine to revive the Velykyi Luh, a natural and historical landscape.
The Velykyi Luh, once a flourishing natural area, was flooded by the waters of the Kakhovka Reservoir in 1955-1958. The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant by Russia in 2023 led to the disappearance of the reservoir, putting Ukraine in front of a historic choice: to rebuild the HPP or revive the Velykyi Luh.

Ecologists argue that the revival of the Velykyi Luh is in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030: Bringing Nature Back into Our Lives, developed by the European Commission. This strategy stipulates that by 2030, half of European territories should become protected areas (30 percent) and be restored to their natural state (20 percent). As Ukraine moves towards the EU, meeting these targets becomes critical, and the restoration of the Velykyi Luh can serve as a model project.
Reviving this natural area harmonizes with both environmental and public concerns. The site of the Kakhovka Reservoir was once the largest natural forest in the steppe zone of Ukraine. Its regeneration holds the potential to fulfill government objectives for expanding forested areas. The return of natural ecosystems over such a large area could have many positive environmental outcomes.
Ecologists also deny the economic feasibility of restoring the HPP. They emphasize that no EU country will finance and implement such an inappropriate environmental project. The costs required for its implementation seem unjustifiable compared to the needs that can be met exclusively by a reservoir. Experts have analyzed that drinking water supply and irrigation, which raised the most questions in the first months after the destruction, can be restored soon without the need to reconstruct the HPP.
The only point that cannot be directly compensated in the absence of reservoir restoration is the electricity generated by the HPP. However, ecology experts emphasize that the role of the Kakhovka HPP as an energy unit held no decisive weight for the state.

Thus, supporters of the Velykyi Luh regeneration assert that it is not just about preserving natural ecosystems, it is also about meeting European biodiversity goals, benefiting the environment and the population, and making economically rational decisions.
The debate over the Kakhovka HPP reconstruction is a complex and multifaceted issue, with convincing arguments on both sides. The impending decision will undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for Ukraine's environment, economy, and energy sector.
On the one hand, the government, farmers, and energy industry advocate for the Kakhovka HPP reconstruction, emphasizing its pivotal role in supplying water to farmland and industrial enterprises, balancing green energy, and preventing environmental degradation.
Ecologists, on the other hand, propose an alternative way which is to regenerate the Velykyi Luh, a natural and historical landscape once flooded by the waters of the Kakhovka reservoir.
Both perspectives emphasize the complexity of this matter. The decision to rebuild the Kakhovka HPP or regenerate the Velykyi Luh is not simply a matter of choosing between energy production and environmental preservation. It involves a comprehensive assessment of many factors like economic feasibility, compliance with the European biodiversity targets, and potential benefits for both the environment and the population.

Moving ahead, it is crucial to continue this dialog, taking into account all perspectives and available information. The impending decision will both shape Ukraine's energy landscape and mold its environmental future. This decision requires thorough consideration, comprehensive analysis, and a balanced assessment of all potential consequences and benefits.

ENERGY IS GOOD FOR TEXAS
Hydro
While only a small contributor to Texas’ energy portfolio, hydropower plays an important role. Hydropower is a rechargeable and endless cycle of generation in which water flows through turbines to create energy. Hydropower uses existing water supplies like lakes and reservoirs and costs relatively little to produce.
Texas Hydropower
THE 26 HYDROPOWER PLANTS IN TEXAS HAVE A MAXIMUM COMBINED CAPACITY OF UP TO 481 MILLION MEGAWATT-HOURS (MWH).
THE STATE’S HYDROPOWER PLANTS SERVE ALMOST 3 MILLION TEXANS.
DURING TIMES OF ENERGY CRISES, HYDROPOWER PLANTS CAN DIRECT THEIR GENERATED ENERGY TO AREAS OF NEED, SUCH AS THOSE EXPERIENCING OUTAGES OR ROLLING BLACKOUTS.

Outlook
Federal funding from the United States Department of Energy has significantly benefitted hydropower in Texas. In 2017, the Whitney Dam, located in central Texas, received $2 million in federal funding to rehabilitate and upgrade its facility. The most recently constructed hydropower plant in Texas, the R.C. Thomas Hydroelectric Project, opened in 2020.
While hydropower has a positive impact on Texas’ energy portfolio, the future of hydropower is ultimately dependent on the success of Texas’ existing and future water supply.

AMENITIES 3 listed
Stanley Abbot, the original Landscape Architect of the parkway chose to highlight water features along the route. As a result, we have the Roanoke River Overlook here at MP114. The river itself begins in Montgomery County, Virginia and passes through Roanoke on its way to empty into the Albemarle Sound in North Carolina.

At only 985’ of elevation, this is one of the lowest overlooks along the parkway, but it still offers an expansive view of the river and the Niagara Dam, sitting a little over 100’ below. Constructed in 1906, it continues to supply power to the city of Roanoke. Behind the plant is a portion of the Norfolk Southern Railway.  

This overlook is the starting point for the Roanoke River Trail, an easy 0.35 mile hike that goes down the cliff and gives other views of the river and plant. About halfway down, the trail splits into the Fisherman’s Trail, which goes to the river, or makes a loop, passing under the bridge to a smaller pedestrian overlook. Fishing is allowed with a valid license. Due to the strong current, swimming is not recommended at this site.
There are approximately 35 painted parking spaces at this site and some benches lining the area.

Why India must ramp up focus on hydro power: A perspective
Even as hydro power continues to play a shrinking role in the overall generation mix of the country, it will play an increasingly important role in grid balancing, stability and meeting the peaking power needs.

Much attention has been paid to the deployment of solar and wind, but the largest source of renewable electricity, both globally and in India, is hydropower. In fact, of the 38 countries which derive more than 50 per cent of their electricity from renewables, all but one (Denmark) are hydropower-dominated.

CEA estimates that India has 145 GW of Hydroelectric potential, of which just 29 per cent has been constructed. In fact, the share of hydropower has declined from 29 per crnt in India’s electricity production in 1985 to just 9 per cent today, leading to an overall decline in percentage of electricity from renewables. As compared to wind and solar, hydro power is of much greater value due to several reasons including black start capability, regulations and frequency response, spinning reserve, non-spinning reserve, and voltage response.

Advt
While many people assume that coal is required for peaks, if one actually looks at India’s generation curve, it is primarily hydro power which is drastically ramping its output down during solar hours, up during the evening peak and then down again over night, whereas coal stays relatively flat (in percentage terms). Hydropower is particularly well suited to balancing wind and solar as, unlike coal, it can be rapidly ramped up and down to meet fluctuations in output. It is crucial to develop reservoir hydro or at least build with pondage so that hydro can save the water during periods of high variable enewable energy (solar and wind) output and then ramp up during periods of high demand or low variable renewable energy output.

Unfortunately, developing new hydro projects is beset with challenges.

Geological Challenges

Most of the hydropower potential is tapped in the North-Eastern and Himalayan region of India. India’s Northeast is one of the six most seismically active regions in the world (Zone-5). The plan for significant projects in the region should take this vulnerability to seismic activity into account. While experts appraise the seismic elements related to the construction area, and dams are designed based on the seismic criteria for ""maximum credible earthquake"" and ""design basic earthquake,"" a lack of proper historical cataloguing of earthquakes, a lack of knowledge of post-earthquake ground motion, and acceleration spectral variation can lead to incorrect assessments. Geological issues, such as slope failure, are the second-largest threats to hydropower plants and dams. The Himalayas are a developing 'folded mountain' in an active tectonic zone, where slope failure is a common occurrence, especially when the delicate rock layers are disturbed by development. Apart from these, issues in the eastern part of the country, such as the existence of soft rocks behind faults, the highly weathered and decomposed rocks under hard gneissic rocks, and the existence of buried channels also poses a major challenge.

Advt
Environmental Challenges

Dam construction alters river flow patterns, impacting aquatic ecosystems and habitats. This leads to the displacement of native fish species and affect downstream ecosystems. Altering the flow of rivers can affect downstream communities and ecosystems that depend on regular water flow patterns. Seasonal variations in water release can disrupt agricultural practices and aquatic life cycles. Hydropower projects can fragment and disrupt natural habitats, leading to a loss of biodiversity. Rare and endemic species may be particularly vulnerable.

Resettlement Challenges

Even when local government is involved, there have been challenges with the incorrect identification of stakeholders and the level of their engagement in massive dam projects. Involuntary displacements, as well as poor resettlement and rehabilitation of individuals impacted by massive Multipurpose River Valley Projects (MRVP), are among of the main grounds for anti-dam activities in India, which impede the land-acquisition process. The Government of India has enacted various laws and acts to provide transparent and equitable compensation and rehabilitation for persons displaced as a result of the development of any hydroelectric project.

Apart from these challenges, many factors hinder the progress of hydro power development in India. That includes low availability of skilled labor and contractors, difficulty in getting clearances, non-adherence to a fixed guideline or checklist by the government, presence of vast hydro potential in the areas affected by insurgency and militant problems, and inter-state and international disputes.

Despite these challenges, 10.2 MW of hydropower is under construction. CEA projects India will have 62.2 GW of hydropower installed by 2032, with up to 65.7 GW in a “high hydro” case. Increasing this amount would decrease the requirement for new thermal or energy storage projects. Additionally, small hydro (SHP) capacity of 4.9 GW has already been achieved through 1167 Small hydro projects. There is a potential of 21.1 GW among 7,133 sites, which means again there is further upside from the current projection of 5.4 GW by 2030.

To help India reach its full hydroelectric potential it is crucial to compensate hydropower for grid services. This can be done indirectly by offering a per unit price that is higher than less valuable or flexible “baseload” coal or variable renewable energy. This can also be done explicitly through a primary ancillary service market and by allowing time-of-use compensation tied to market rates. It is equally important to streamline regulatory procedures by simplifying and expediting regulatory approvals process, especially for small hydro power projects.

It is also important to ensure proper geological survey and planning considering the seismic risks and challenges, and providing risk mitigation and financial incentives for SHPs including loan guarantees from central or state governments. Two other important action items include standardized design and technology to reduce the engineering overhead, especially for SHPs, and community participation. Local participation and ownership must be encouraged to ensure that local communities benefit economically and are engaged in decision making.

Even as hydro power continues to play a shrinking role in the overall generation mix of the country, it will play an increasingly important role in grid balancing, stability and meeting the peaking power needs. In a 100 per cent RE by 2047 future, hydropower will play a crucial role in ramping up during low Variable Renewable Energy days. It is, therefore, important to continue to invest in hydro power in a sustainable, inclusive manner.

Hydropower
Our hydroelectric power stations harness a natural, sustainable and reliable source of energy to generate renewable electricity – and reduce our carbon footprint. Learn how it works and the benefits to Melbourne.
How hydropower works
Hydropower is energy captured from the pressure of falling or fast-moving water.
On its way to Melbourne, water is transferred via gravity from our major storage reservoirs (located at high elevations) to our smaller service reservoirs (at lower elevations).
Water pressure in the pipelines must be managed as they approach the lower reservoirs. In the past this was achieved using pressure-reducing valves, but rather than letting this energy go to waste, we now channel the water through hydroelectric turbines.
Pressure on the turbine blades rotates a shaft, which drives an electrical generator that converts the motion into electricity.
The electricity is fed back into the power grid, reducing our operating costs – and costs to customers.
Watch this video for an overview of the process:

Our hydroelectric program
We generate electricity throughout our water supply network, with our suite of 14 hydroelectric power stations now producing more energy than we use.
Our Notting Hill mini-hydro plant, commissioned in 2009.
Thanks to our mini-hydroelectricity plants:
69,500 megawatt hours of power are generated each year – equal to…
14,100 homes powered
75,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions are prevented, about the same as…
29,200 cars taken off the road
We’re continuing to expand our network of mini-hydros. Our new power station at St Albans is in its proof of performance stage and will be completed in mid 2023. Upper Yarra Reservoir will be completed in late 2023, and O’Shannassy in late 2024.
This is part of our commitment to tackling climate change and helping to decarbonise the Victorian electricity grid.

History of our hydropower
  1984-89
Thomson Dam hydroelectricity plant
Our first hydroelectric power station was installed at Cardinia Reservoir in 1984.
This was followed by Thomson Reservoir in 1989, which was later upgraded in 2012.
  2004
We reviewed our water supply network and identified sites that had potential for hydroelectric generation. These were assessed and ranked on their:
ability to generate electricity
availability of the local electricity network to accept power generated
economic viability
risk associated with their operation.
A key operational challenge was sudden turbine shutdowns and their potential to generate pressure transients, or “water hammers”, in the supplying water pipeline. This risk was eliminated through innovative power station design, valving and surge mitigation devices.
  2008-10
Six mini hydroelectric power stations were built throughout the water supply network.
In 2010, an energy recovery hydroelectric power station was installed on the outlet of the North-South Pipeline.
  2016-17
Notting Hill mini-hydro plant
Five new hydroelectric power stations were added to the water supply network.
Their design drew heavily on learnings gained during past construction, and significant advances were made in housing the units and minimising their cost of construction.
Watch the following video to see how this was achieved:
Video: Melbourne Water’s mini hydro-electricity program - transcript
2020-22
Three new mini-hydro power stations will be built and commissioned at St Albans, O’Shannassy and Upper Yarra Reservoirs.

Energy Mix
Explore global data on where our energy comes from, and how this is changing.
By: Hannah Ritchie and Pablo Rosado

Energy production – mainly the burning of fossil fuels – accounts for around three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. Not only is energy production the largest driver of climate change, but the burning of fossil fuels and biomass also comes at a large cost to human health: at least five million deaths are attributed to air pollution each year.
The world therefore needs to shift away from fossil fuels to an energy mix dominated by low-carbon sources of energy – renewable technologies and nuclear power.
What does our energy mix look like today? What countries have the 'cleanest' energy mix? And are we making progress in shifting towards a low-carbon energy system?
This article focuses on the breakdown of energy sources: how they vary across the world and how this is changing over time.
In the energy domain, there are many different units thrown around – joules, exajoules, million tonnes of oil equivalents, barrel equivalents, British thermal units, and terawatt-hours, to name a few. This can be confusing, and make comparisons difficult. So at Our World in Data, we try to maintain consistency by converting all energy data to watt-hours. We do this to compare energy data across different metrics and sources.
Global primary energy: how has the mix changed over centuries?
Today when we think about energy mixes we think about a diverse range of sources – coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydropower, solar, wind, and biofuels. But If we look back a couple of centuries ago, our energy mixes were relatively homogeneous. And the transition from one source to another was incredibly slow.
In the chart shown we see global primary energy consumption dating back to the year 1800. This earlier data is sourced from Vaclav Smil's work Energy Transitions: Global and National Perspectives.1 Data from 1965 onwards comes from the latest release of Energy Institute’s Statistical Review of World Energy.2
We see that until the mid-19th century, traditional biomass – the burning of solid fuels such as wood, crop waste, or charcoal – was the dominant source of energy used across the world. But with the Industrial Revolution came the rise of coal; followed by oil, gas; and by the turn of the 20th century, hydropower.
It wasn't until the 1960s that nuclear energy was added to the mix. What is often referred to as 'modern renewables' – solar and wind – were only added much later, in the 1980s.
What Vaclav Smil – and other researchers studying these long-term energy transitions across countries – highlights in his work is the slow rate at which energy transitions have occurred in the past. The speed and scale of the energy transition we need today in switching from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy is therefore a new challenge, very different from the past.
Energy mix: what sources do we get our energy from?
Let's look at our energy mix today, and explore what sources we draw upon.
In the interactive chart shown, we see the primary energy mix broken down by fuel or generation source.
Globally we get the largest amount of our energy from oil, followed by coal, gas, then hydroelectric power. But other renewable sources are now growing quickly.
In the charts here we see the breakdown of the energy mix by country. First with the higher-level breakdown by fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables. Then the specific breakdown by source, including coal, gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, and other renewables (which include bioenergy, wave, and tidal).
This is given in terms of per capita consumption.
How much of global energy comes from low-carbon sources?
Around three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels for energy.3 To reduce global emissions we need to shift our energy systems away from fossil fuels to low-carbon sources of energy. We need to ‘decarbonize’.
How big is this challenge? How much of our energy currently comes from low-carbon sources?
In the chart here we see the breakdown of global primary energy consumption.4
Here we take primary energy based on the ‘substitution method’ for energy accounting. For those interested in energy accounting methods, at the end of this post, we look at comparisons of direct versus substitution methods. The quick summary is that this accounting method tries to account for the energy lost from the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production and aims to provide the appropriate comparison of how much more low-carbon energy we would need to replace fossil fuels in the energy mix. It’s one of the preferred accounting methods used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).5
Approximately one-sixth of global primary energy comes from low-carbon sources. Low-carbon sources are the sum of nuclear energy and renewables – which includes hydropower, wind, solar, bioenergy, geothermal, and wave and tidal.6
Hydropower and nuclear account for most of our low-carbon energy, but wind and solar are growing quickly.
Which countries get the most energy from low-carbon sources?
In the interactive map here we see the share of primary energy that comes from low-carbon sources across countries.
Globally, our progress in shifting towards a low-carbon economy has been slow. That may leave us pessimistic about a path forward. But some countries – often some of the world’s richest countries who have high carbon footprints – show us that significant progress on decarbonizing our energy systems is possible. They still have a long way to go but are moving in the right direction.
Poorer countries face a bigger challenge: they must grow their economies, giving their populations access to energy, and healthcare and alleviating poverty whilst avoiding the carbon-intensive pathways today’s rich countries have taken. To do this, they need clean energy to be cheap, undercutting fossil fuel alternatives. In this regard, the world’s richest countries also have a role to play: the scale-up of low-carbon energy should help to drive down costs. We have already seen this effect with the rapid decline in solar prices in recent years.
Is the world making progress in decarbonizing energy?
Three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels for energy.7 To tackle climate change, we need to transition away from fossil fuels and decarbonize our energy systems.
The world now gets approximately one-sixth of its energy from low-carbon sources – either nuclear or renewables. How has this changed over time?
Does our track record give us reason to be optimistic that we can quickly decarbonize?
In the chart below we see the share of global energy that comes from low-carbon sources. We’ve certainly made progress since half a century ago: while the global consumption of energy increased almost 4-fold, the share of low-carbon sources has nearly tripled.
Fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables: how is the global energy mix changing?
In the chart, we see the share of global energy that comes from fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear. The sum of the top two is what we want to increase.
Part of this slow progress is due to the fact that much of the gains made in renewables have been offset by a decline in nuclear energy. Renewables have been growing while nuclear has been rolled back.8
Overall, this means that the combined share from low-carbon sources has increased by less than we might have expected. Having both renewables and nuclear pulling in the same direction would certainly have helped. But it wouldn’t be enough: the rate of progress would still have been slow.
It’s the total amount of fossil fuels we burn that matters – and we continue to burn more each year
But we’re still fooling ourselves a bit in looking at this progress through the lens of what share of our energy is low-carbon.
When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, the atmosphere does not care about shares, only absolutes. That is what ultimately determines the amount of CO2 we emit, and the rate at which it accumulates in the atmosphere.
Global energy consumption is not stagnant, but growing. And in the past years, it has been growing too quickly for renewables and nuclear to keep up.
In the chart here we see primary energy consumption in absolute terms for each source. We continue to produce more energy from fossil fuels – particularly oil and gas – each year.
Low-carbon energy is certainly growing across the world – undoubtedly a sign of progress.
Decarbonization is happening. But not nearly fast enough. To achieve the necessary progress that matters for the climate we need to see its growth not only meet our new energy demands each year but start displacing existing fossil fuels in the energy mix at a much faster rate.
Energy consumption by source
Fossil fuels: what share of energy comes from fossil fuels?
Fossil fuels are the sum of coal, oil, and gas. Combined, they are the largest source of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). We therefore want to shift our energy systems away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon sources of energy.
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas summed together) across the world.
Coal: what share of energy comes from coal?
Coal has been a critical energy source and a mainstay in global energy production for centuries.
But it's also the most polluting energy source: both in terms of the amount of CO2 it produces per unit of energy, but also the amount of local air pollution it creates. Moving away from coal energy is important for climate change as well as human health.
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from coal across the world.
Oil: what share of energy comes from oil?
Oil is the world's largest energy source today. It is the dominant source of energy for the transport sector in particular.
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from oil across the world.
Gas: what share of energy comes from gas?
Natural gas has, for decades, lagged behind coal and oil as an energy source. But today its consumption is growing rapidly – often as a replacement for coal in the energy mix. Gas is a major provider of electricity production and a key source of heat.
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from gas across the world.
Nuclear: what share of energy comes from nuclear?
Nuclear energy – alongside hydropower – has been a key source of low-carbon energy for many countries across the world in recent decades. But there are large differences in the role of nuclear – some countries rely heavily on it for energy production; others produce no energy at all from it.
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from nuclear across the world.
Renewables: how much of our energy comes from renewables?
Renewable energy is a collective term used to capture several different energy sources. 'Renewables' typically include hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and wave and tidal energy.
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from renewables (the sum of all renewable energy technologies) across the world.
The share of energy we get from individual renewable technologies – solar, or wind, for example – is given in the sections below.
Hydropower: what share of energy comes from hydropower?
Hydroelectric power has been an influential low-carbon energy technology for many countries for more than half a century. Globally, it is still the largest source of renewable energy.
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from hydropower across the world.
Solar: what share of energy comes from solar?
Solar energy is a relatively new energy technology but is growing very quickly.
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from solar technologies across the world.
Wind: what share of energy comes from wind?
This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from wind (both onshore and offshore) across the world.

ENDNOTES
Vaclav Smil (2017). Energy Transitions: Global and National Perspectives.
Note that this data presents primary energy consumption via the ‘substitution method’. The ‘substitution method’ – in comparison to the ‘direct method’ – attempts to correct for the inefficiencies (energy wasted as heat during combustion) in fossil fuel and biomass conversion. It does this by correcting nuclear and modern renewable technologies to their ‘primary input equivalents’ if the same quantity of energy were to be produced from fossil fuels.
The remaining quarter comes from industrial processes (such as cement production), agriculture, land use change, and waste.
This is based on primary energy data published annually in the Energy Institute’s Statistical Review of World Energy.

The emissions from these sources are not necessarily zero – the mining of materials, production, maintenance, and decommissioning of these technologies may produce some carbon, but per unit of energy this is very small relative to fossil fuels.

The remaining quarter comes from industrial processes (mainly cement production), agriculture, land use change, and waste.
This is even clearer when we focus on global electricity production: nuclear declined by almost as much as renewables gained.

Shoshone Dam, here on August 13, 2021, near Glenwood Springs, is generating electricity through its turbines on the Colorado River. The dam and power plant near the Hanging Lake parking area was constructed in the early 1900s. (Hugh Carey, The Colorado Sun)
A Western Slope coalition is making a play to buy the water rights of a small hydropower plant with a big role in how water moves across Colorado. If the group succeeds, farmers, water providers, anglers and rafters say they could sleep more easily for years into the future.
“Any kind of an agreement that would take the unknown out of the situation is a relief and allows me to sleep at night,” said Ken Murphy, who owns the rafting company Glenwood Adventure Company. “Recreation is only one aspect to this, and we’re just a small aspect of this, but a very important aspect in our local community.”
The Shoshone Power Plant, owned by Xcel Energy, is small compared with some of the company’s other power plants, but its right to water on the Colorado River is one of the oldest and largest within state lines. Local economies and communities from Glenwood Springs to Grand Junction are dependent on consistent flows out of the plant and have been worried for decades about another entity snapping up the Shoshone water rights and siphoning off their water supply.
The coalition, led by the Colorado River Water Conservation District, wants to buy the water rights for $98.5 million and lease them back to Xcel, a move it believes would protect the water and keep it in the river forever. The negotiations are in the early stages, and state officials are weighing some fundamental questions about the agreement. But the decadeslong effort to purchase the rights seems to be experiencing a moment of “convergence” that has Western Slope water users feeling hopeful.
“Today, we really are at a historic moment in our pursuit of Shoshone permanency,” said Peter Fleming, general counsel for the Colorado River District. His comments came Wednesday at a meeting of the Colorado Water Conservation Board, or CWCB. The coalition has asked the water agency for a $20 million grant to help fund the purchase.
The partners have a willing seller in Xcel, support from 17 municipalities and water providers across Western Colorado and access to “incredible” federal and state funding opportunities, he said.
“This is a big convergence that, in my long time at the river district, we’ve never come close to,”  Fleming said.
This Fresh Water News story is a collaboration between The Colorado Sun and Water Education Colorado. It also appears at wateredco.org/fresh-water-news.
Some board members asked how they could show support without tying up $20 million during a tight budget year. Others said they understood just how important Shoshone was to water on the Western Slope. 
When you live along the main stem of the Colorado River, Shoshone is central to how the whole river system is managed. 
“It’s how we all live,” said Paul Bruchez, a board member and rancher near Kremmling.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser questioned how the agreement would work, especially the portion related to instream water rights. State law says the CWCB is the only entity in Colorado that can own that type of water right. But as proposed, the river district would hold the title to the right, while assigning its management to CWCB in perpetuity. That’s not how things are ordinarily done, Weiser said.
“An alternative structure could easily be: Xcel doesn’t sell the right, which would then be held by the state as an instream flow right, until it’s done with it,” Weiser said during the meeting. “That would achieve the same result.”
“If we could convince the seller,” Fleming responded.
The board did not vote on the deal or discuss whether it would help fund the effort Wednesday. The deal is still in draft form, but the river district staff hopes it will be able to finalize the purchase and sale agreement in January. 
It could take one or two years to wrap up the whole process. After the purchase agreement comes consultation with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission and a water court case to legally update the water right — not to mention pulling together millions of dollars.
Why fight for Shoshone
Western Slope water users are hopeful that the deal will go through. They’ll support anything that keeps water flowing west, many said.
“It would guarantee there’s going to be water available for Western Slope agriculture in the mainstream of the Colorado Basin,” said Steve Child, a rancher and Pitkin County commissioner. “To me, it’s as close as you could come to a guarantee that we could keep irrigated agriculture going in this part of Western Colorado.”
The Shoshone Power Plant, about 8 miles east of Glenwood Springs, has been sitting on the Colorado River since the early 1900s, although the generating station and its two turbines are easily ignored by drivers speeding down Interstate 70.

The power plant helps bring consistent flows to hundreds of downstream users. There are approximately 140 water diversions that have over 600 combined water rights on the Colorado River main stem below the Shoshone Power Plant and above the Cameo Diversion where the Grand Valley Canal and Grand Valley Project water rights are taken, according to the state Department of Natural Resources. 
Glenwood Adventure’s Murphy said his business depends on the river. He runs rafting trips on the Colorado River downstream from Shoshone. The flows are consistent enough for him to be able to book trips a year or two in advance, which is key for his business. 
The rafting season is also long, sometimes lasting from late March to the end of October. That’s helpful for his employees, many of whom work the ski slopes in the winter and want to work in the recreation industry year-round.
“Mother Nature is our boss, and there’s nothing consistent these days with Mother Nature,” Murphy said. “Any conversations or agreements that can come out to give us consistent flows, then we can manage our operations a little bit easier.”
For water providers, more water in the river equals better water quality, which makes it easier to treat for drinking water or to comply with wastewater treatment standards. 
The Ute Water Conservancy District pulls from the river as a backup water source for 88,000 people in the Grand Junction area. The district, which drew water from the river for the first time in 50 years in 2021, joined the coalition to purchase the Shoshone water rights to keep the status quo and to preserve water flows for the Western Slope.
“It’s important because it provides the flow of water through all of Western Colorado,” said Larry Clever, the district’s general manager. “The big advantage to us is, it helps the irrigators down here with water quality and volume.”
Chemist Allison Dederick checks water quality in the lab at Ute Water Conservancy District in Grand Junction. The district began drawing water from the Colorado River on June 10, 2021, which will require the district to treat its supply differently. (Handout)
Downstream, steady flows are vital for the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program, which runs along a 15-mile stretch of the river near Palisade.
The Colorado River District estimated that, in dry years, Shoshone sends 41,000 acre-feet to 86,000 acre-feet of water through the reach that wouldn’t otherwise be there. That equates to about 17% to 50% of the actual flow on that stretch of the river, Mueller said. 
One acre-foot can provide a yearlong supply of water for two to three households.
Colorado water users are required to comply with the Endangered Species Act, and Andy Mueller, general manager of the river district, said Shoshone’s water rights can help Colorado fulfill that obligation.
“Keeping those fish thriving and being successful with that program as we have been over the last 40 years really rests on the back of the Shoshone Power Plant,” he said.
Ryan Davis, owner of Hookers Fly Shop, books trips on the Colorado River from Glenwood Canyon to Rifle. 
When water is low and warm, the company can’t use the Colorado River at all because it is closed to protect fish populations, Davis said. During closures, all of the outfitters head to the Roaring Fork River, which leads to lines of boats waiting to launch and overfishing on the river, he said. 
He and his team end up telling customers about the river conditions and leave it up to them to confirm the booking. Sometimes customers choose not to, he said.
“A lot of our customers only want to fish on the Colorado, so we book them to take them on the Colorado. If it’s too low or too warm, we can’t take them there,” Davis said. “It does cut into our business quite a bit.”

From Forests to Faucets
In the Green River Watershed, our well-managed forest lands help ensure high-quality drinking water. Forests filter water in many ways. Trees slow down the rainfall before it reaches the forest floor so it can release gradually into rivers. This helps prevent erosion and the rainwater is then naturally filtered as it moves through the ground.

In Ecuador, riverside communities feel impacts from hydropower push
Disasters and legal battles have plagued the San José del Tambo hydroelectric facility, raising concerns over the local impacts of Ecuador’s renewable energy plans

As winter arrives and the Dulcepamba River begins to swell, Polo Jiménez prays its waters do not reach his house. His bedtime routine now includes leaving a torch, a change of clothes and his identification papers by the door, in case he needs to evacuate during the night.
Jiménez never imagined such a routine 30 years ago, when he settled in this part of central Ecuador in his twenties. Jiménez lives in San Pablo de Amalí, a community of 480 people in Bolívar province. Here in the western foothills of the Andes, water is everywhere. Such abundance has long been a blessing, but it is fast becoming a major concern. 
“When I built [my house], I was 300 metres from the river, but now, as you can see, there are not even 15 metres,” says Jiménez. For this, he blames the San José del Tambo hydroelectric plant.
In 2005, Ecuador’s environment ministry authorised power company Hidrotambo to build this plant between the villages of San José del Tambo and San Pablo de Amalí. The plant entered operation in 2016, with an installed capacity of eight megawatts (MW). Since work on the project commenced, some of those living near the Dulcepamba River have denounced the diversions to its course that the project has caused. They claim that changes to the river have affected 140 communities by triggering deadly floods and economic losses.

Hydropower proliferation and paralysis
Hydropower generates over 80% of Ecuador’s electricity, with projects often sited in sensitive areas: the Ecuadorian Amazon, for example, is home to 18% of all active hydropower plants in the entire Amazon rainforest. This includes the country’s largest, the Coca Codo Sinclair dam, which has been linked to the disappearance of the San Rafael waterfall.
Hidrotambo’s San José del Tambo plant captures run-of-the-river hydropower, which means it relies on the natural energy of the Dulcepamba to move its turbines, rather than a reservoir-forming dam. Such plants are generally considered a more environmentally friendly way to generate hydropower compared to dams and reservoirs, which compromise a river’s ecology and increase flood risks. Nevertheless, the plant partially diverts the Dulcepamba River, bringing it closer to homes and causing a risk of floods when its levels are high.
Ecuadorian law does not grant the power to permanently deny authorisation for a project exploiting renewable resources on public land. Such proposals can therefore be submitted repeatedly until approval is granted, which is fuelling conflicts.
RECOMMENDED
One of country’s best-known hydroelectric predicaments is the “paralysed” Toachi Pilatón in central Ecuador. This 254 MW project was first awarded in 2007 but, following a series of delays and a government bribery scandal, it is still only partially operational.
In the case of the 30 MW Piatúa hydropower project in the eastern province of Pastaza, Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition (MAATE) granted it an environmental licence in 2014, but by 2019 construction had been halted by Pastaza’s provincial court. The ruling demanded a more thorough environmental impact report, and the case has since been picked up by Ecuador’s constitutional court.
Big changes on the Dulcepamba
Hidrotambo’s environmental impact report for the San José del Tambo hydroelectric plant, conducted in 2005, downplayed flood risks. The report acknowledged that displaced riverbed materials could block water drainage routes in the Dulcepamba river basin, but concluded that “the incidence of this phenomenon is low”.

Almost 20 years later, floods occur on a regular basis. In communications with Diálogo Chino, Hidrotambo’s general manager, Franklin Pico, describes the river basin as a “high-risk area” for flooding.
Jiménez first found himself living on the edge of the Dulcepamba in 2015, after the biggest flood in the river’s history brought its bank to his home. The flood also left three people dead and swept away houses, animals and crops.
Local resident Filadelfo Borja tells Diálogo Chino that before hydropower came to the area, Dulcepamba’s floods would destroy “a maximum of two cocoa plants”. In 2015, however, Borja lost all his crops and his family was forced to leave the area.
In 2014, Jiménez’s neighbour Manuel Trujillo filed a complaint with the Bolívar province court of justice. He claimed that the Dulcepamba had been diverted towards his property, which the court rejected. A year later, the floods washed away his house.
Following the 2015 flood, an inspection report by the ARCONEL, the national electricity regulator, advised Hidrotambo to build a breakwater to protect San Pablo de Amalí, warning that “the next flooding of the river could seriously affect the population.”
To date, a flood barrier has not been built. In the meantime, damaging floods have occurred in 2017, 2019 and 2023. During the flooding this year, the area’s sole access road was destroyed, and members of the local community tell Diálogo Chino that helicopters were needed to bring supplies.

Meanwhile, a recent drop in the Dulcepamba’s fish numbers has been noted by locals, including San Pablo de Amalí resident Carmen Guanulema: “They have disappeared; there is no more fishing like before.”
A 2021 study into Ecuador’s freshwater fish populations found that many native species are under threat from, among other factors, the physical alteration of rivers, as well as hydroelectric power plants. Run-of-the-river dams that divert significant amounts of water, like Hidrotambo’s on the Dulcepamba, can drastically alter fish habitats. Yet despite complaints from the population, no studies have been conducted on fish in this area to date.
Accusations of river manipulation
At the edge of the hydroelectric plant’s catchment area, Diálogo Chino observes a wall of stones. San Pablo de Amalí residents claim that this wall is built by Hidrotambo every summer, when the river is lower, to direct as much water as possible into the plant; in the winter, they claim Hidrotambo removes these stones. Consequently, local communities often suffer from water scarcity in the summer and floods in the winter.
Hidrotambo’s Pico tells Diálogo Chino that this wall of stones forms by itself, from “all the material that [a flood] carries from the higher areas of the mountain”. Furthermore, he asserts that the river has never been diverted by the company. However, some experts disagree. Jorge Celi, director of the UNESCO Chair on Tropical Freshwater Management, tells Diálogo Chino the wall could not have formed on its own. Based on his comparison of the Dulcepamba River during fieldwork in 2012 and 2018, Celi also says Hidrotambo’s hydroelectric plant “influenced the change in the riverbed”.

Residents claim that Hidrotambo, the company that runs the facility, builds a stone wall every summer to maximise the water diverted to the plant, and dismantles it in the winter, creating alternating water scarcity and floods. (Image: Misha Vallejo Prut)

Similarly, a March 2023 flood risk inspection by Ecuador’s Secretariat of Risk Management identified an increasing risk of flooding in San Pablo de Amalí and attributed “some degree of responsibility” to Hidrotambo. The report presented the wall of stones as an intentional construction by Hidrotambo and called for its removal. As of July 2023, however, the wall was still standing.
Hydropower litigation spreading across Ecuador
Hidrotambo has initiated various criminal proceedings against residents of San Pablo de Amalí since 2006, when construction of the power plant began. During that year, the company commenced legal action against 42 people who refused to comply with eviction notices. In 2013, Hidrotambo accused two residents of “terrorism” – a threat regularly levelled at environmental defenders during the era of Rafael Correa’s presidency (2007–2017).
The community has responded with its own legal action. In 2018, San Pablo de Amalí residents filed a request with Ecuador’s water secretariat, Senagua, to review Hidrotambo’s water use. The government accepted the request in 2019 and Hidrotambo lost the right to use the Dulcepamba during the summer months.

On 30 May this year, the environment ministry wholly withdrew its authorisation for Hidrotambo to use the waters of the Dulcepamba. This decision was triggered by instances of non-compliance uncovered by the review. Hidrotambo’s infractions included capturing a higher flow of water than authorised between July and December, and failing to submit agreed-upon redesigns for the plant to address its water abstraction issues.

Hidrotambo appealed the decision less than two weeks later, citing “violations of rights” during the review process. The ministry was meant to give a final verdict on the appeal within 90 days, but has yet to do so. With no verdict forthcoming, and with the country in the midst of political upheaval and elections, the company continues to operate, despite the ministry’s order.
The company is also being pursued through Ecuador’s constitutional court: in September 2019, the country’s Ombudsman’s Office and the Ecumenical Human Rights Commission filed a so-called extraordinary action for protection against Hidrotambo.
In 2008, Ecuador became the first country to protect the rights of nature in its constitution. Environmental lawyer Hugo Echeverría tells Diálogo Chino that the Hidrotambo-Dulcepamba case was selected by the constitutional court to “create jurisprudence” – or set a legal precedent – for defending these rights. It is one of six cases chosen by the court to build this jurisprudence. This set also includes the Piatúa hydropower case, and a well-known case named after a monkey called Estrellita, which ruled that wild animals have legal rights.
When a final decision arrives, the Hidrotambo-Dulcepamba case will be the first in which Ecuador’s constitutional court rules on the standards and limitations of state-managed renewable and non-renewable resource exploitation, as well as the actions of concessionary companies and whether they infringe upon collective rights and the rights of nature. In addition, this legal process will determine whether the possible inaction of the state caused a violation of human rights, because citizens had already earlier denounced the problems resulting from the overflowing of the river.

Ecuador’s hydroelectric future
Meanwhile, a hydroelectric plant twice the size of the Coca Codo Sinclair dam is currently being planned in Morona-Santiago province, in Ecuador’s south-east. Named after the Santiago River that it intends to exploit, the project would have a maximum capacity of 3,600 MW.
The project is scheduled for operation by 2031, although an operator is yet to be announced. It does not have an environmental licence.
“It is a unique river,” Celi says of the Santiago, one of the main arteries connecting the Peruvian and Ecuadorian Amazon. “We are talking about a hydroelectric facility that is 200 metres high, on a torrential river that carries a lot of sediment. All of these will stop behind the dam, and that has a strong impact on the downstream dynamics.”
Back in Bolívar province, Polo Jiménez and the communities of the Dulcepamba River continue to navigate the local consequences of Ecuador’s hydropower reliance, and hope for solutions. “I no longer want to be afraid of falling asleep,” he says. “I just hope there is more security so that the river doesn’t come, and will leave us alone.”

A dam is a structure built across a river or stream to hold back water. People have used different materials to build dams over the centuries. Ancient dam builders used natural materials such as rocks or clay. Modern-day dam builders often use concrete.
Manmade dams create artificial lakes called reservoirs. Reservoirs can be used to store water for farming, industry, and household use. They also can be used for fishing, boating, and other leisure activities. People have used dams for many centuries to help prevent flooding.
The ancient Mesopotamians may have been some of the first humans to build dams. The oldest known dam is the Jawa Dam, located in present-day Jordan. It was built in the fourth century B.C.E. Dams provided farmers with a steady source of water to irrigate crops. This allowed ancient Mesopotamians to feed a growing population.
The Romans were master-dam builders too. They used dams to divert water for drinking, bathing, and irrigation. One of the oldest dams still in use is the Cornalvo Dam in Spain. The ancient Romans built it in the first or second century C.E.
The force of flowing water creates mechanical power. People have harnessed this power for centuries with the use of dams. Small dams powered paddle wheels in pre-industrial Europe and America. These were used to help saw logs or grind corn and other grains.
During the Industrial Revolution, engineers began to build bigger dams. These industrial-sized dams could hold back more water to power the big machinery of factories and mines. They also could turn giant turbines to generate electricity.
The early 1900s ushered in an era of “big dam” building in America as demands for electricity increased. During the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt put Americans back to work building massive dam projects. The most famous of these is the Hoover Dam.
The Hoover Dam sits on the border between Nevada and Arizona. It was completed in 1936. The Hoover Dam is regarded as an engineering marvel. It was the tallest dam ever built at the time—222 meters (727 feet). The dam helped to control the flow of water on the Colorado River by creating Lake Mead, one of the largest reservoirs in the United States. Lake Mead provides drinking water for the city of Las Vegas.
Dams have long been viewed as a symbol of human ingenuity. However, ecologists who study rivers and lakes have uncovered some environmental downsides to dam construction. Dams change the way rivers function, and in some cases, this can harm local fish populations.
Flooding landscapes to create reservoirs can have consequences for biodiversity as well. Brazilian biologist Raffaello Di Ponzio studies the impact of big dam projects on the plants and animals of the Amazon Rainforest. More than 200 hydroelectric dams have been proposed in Brazil. While these dams could help satisfy growing South American energy demands, they would also flood more than 10 million hectares (25 million acres) of the Amazon Rainforest.

Human Modification of the Environment
For thousands of years, humans have modified the physical environment by clearing land for agriculture or damming streams to store and divert water. As we industrialized, we built factories and power plants. While these modifications directly impact the local environment, they also impact environments farther away due to the interconnectivity of Earth’s systems. For example, when a dam is built, less water flows downstream. This impacts the communities and wildlife located downstream who might depend on that water.

At a glance
The hydropower industry has had encouraging boosts this year in North and Central America, with policy changes that will further unlock the potential to develop and modernise hydropower. North America's substantial hydropower potential is predominantly concentrated within Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Mexico, with its varied topography and extensive river systems, holds an estimated 20 GW of exploitable hydropower potential. Canada, rich in water resources, has an estimated technical hydropower potential of 160 GW and the U.S. has an estimated exploitable potential at over 65 GW. In 2022, 1 GW of hydropower was developed, continuing with previous years’ development. Most notably, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Canada’s 2023 budget will both incentivise hydropower development through innovative tax credit schemes.

‍
There was also an increase across countries to modernise existing hydropower projects, which expanded their capacity and increased their expected lifespan, to continue providing renewable energy to communities and power systems for longer.  
To develop North and Central America’s sustainable hydropower projects, investment in the industry needs to follow the policy announcements. The path forward requires innovative technical solutions, inclusive and respectful engagement with indigenous communities, a strong commitment to environmental sustainability, and regulatory streamlining.

Hydropower provided Canada with approximately 61 per cent of the country’s total annual electricity generation and represents more than half of its total generation capacity. The 2023 Canadian Budget introduces a Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, which is a 15 per cent refundable tax credit for eligible investments in non-emitting electricity generation systems including hydropower (regardless of scale) and PSH, with new projects and refurbishment of existing projects to be eligible.  
The Keeyask power plant in Manitoba (695 MW), the last two of seven generating units were placed in service and the Romaine 4 power plant (245 MW) in Québec reached completion. The last unit came on-line, completing the commissioning of the four-plant cascade system, totalling its generation capacity to 1,550 MW.  
The Champlain Hudson Power Express is a ground breaking high-voltage direct current underwater and underground power cable project that will transfer 10.4 TWh of hydropower from Québec to New York City, expected to be commissioned in 2026.
Canadian TC Energy Corporation is the owner and developer of two pumped hydropower storage projects. The Ontario Pumped Storage Project (1 GW) is expected to become operational in 2030 and will create more than 3,800 jobs. Alberta will host TC Energy’s other project, the 75 MW Canyon Creek Pumped Hydro Energy Storage Project, which will provide up to 37 hours of on-demand, flexible, clean energy and ancillary services to the electricity grid.
Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro have proposed to expand the 604 MW Bay d'Espoir hydroelectric generating station, which began operating more than 50 years ago and includes seven generating units in two powerhouses.
In British Columbia, construction of the 1.1 GW Site C hydro project in Peace River, is ongoing, with the installation of the first turbine runner in 2022 and is expected to be operational in 2025.  
The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) in Ontario released two reports in 2022: the Pathways to Decarbonization (P2D) and the Annual Planning Outlook, both of which emphasise the need to take action to realise the potential of long-lead time hydropower projects. The IESO has highlighted that permitting and approvals must be streamlined, and Indigenous community participation is essential for success. The P2D assumes an additional 2,000 MW of long-duration storage will be added in the late 2030s to meet adequacy needs.


Case Study‍
The United States made several major investment announcements in 2022 that will positively impact the hydropower sector. Following the success of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) signed in November 2021, the US$370bn Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) adopted in 2022 is the nation’s most significant climate legislation to date. The landmark measure recognises that hydropower plays a critical role in accelerating the transition to a more reliable, clean energy grid. The tax credits created by the IRA will provide investment certainty upgrades at existing hydropower facilities, incentivise development of new pumped storage facilities, retrofits of non-powered dams with hydropower generation and new marine energy and hydrokinetic generation by creating a 10-year investment tax credit and production tax credit framework for these projects.  
The tax credits provided by the IRA will be equivalent to other renewable technologies such that a megawatt of electricity produced from hydropower receives the same level of federal tax support as a megawatt produced from other zero-carbon resources.  
Additionally, earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced US$8m for technologies to increase hydropower flexibility. The following projects were awarded the money:  
• General Electric’s research to develop a cost-effective and easy-to-implement method to increase hydropower units’ ability to ramp electricity generation.
• Littoral Power Systems Inc’s Turbine and Generator upgrade system that designs, builds, and field tests a rapidly deployable upgrade system for existing hydropower plants.
• Oregon State University’s Hybrid Hydropower-Storage Units that demonstrates and quantifies the value of a hybrid hydroelectric-storage generation units.
Fundamentally, the framework established by the IRA and the DOE could help the hydropower industry by supporting billions of dollars in investment in building new projects as well as maintaining and enhancing existing infrastructure.  
Interesting Fact  
One cannot speak about hydropower in North America without invoking the concerns of Indigenous rights.  
In the United States, the ‘Uncommon Dialogue’ initiative launched in 2021 set the blueprint for Native American tribes, environmentalists, and the hydropower industry to reach a deal in 2022 on a proposed legislative package that could boost clean energy as well as river conservation. This will give tribes the authority to put conditions on permits for things like protection of tribal cultural resources and fish passage.  
In neighbouring Canada, a settlement was reached with West Moberly First Nations, BC Hydro and the Canadian government regarding financial benefits, contracting opportunities and jointly developed recommendations for land management measures over provincial Crown lands for the Site C hydro project in British Columbia.  
In addition, the Québec portion of the CHPE line to bring hydropower to New York City will be co-owned by the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke (MCK), representing the Indigenous people whose community lies close to the start of the line. As noted by the MCK, “this project demonstrates that collaborating with an Indigenous community can prove to be mutually beneficial for industry and Indigenous communities alike”.

2021-2022 Hydropower Accomplishments
Hydropower, otherwise known as hydroelectric power, offers a number of advantages to the communities that they serve. Hydropower and pumped storage continue to play a crucial role in our fight against climate change by providing essential power, storage, and flexibility services. Below are just some of the benefits that hydropower can provide as the United States transitions to 100% clean electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050.
In a study led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on hydropower flexibility, preliminary analysis found that the firm capacity associated with U.S. hydropower’s flexibility is estimated to be over 24 GW. To replace this capability with storage would require the buildout of 24 GW of 10-hour storage—more than all the existing storage in the United States today. Additionally, in terms of integrating wind and solar, the flexibility presented in existing U.S. hydropower facilities could help bring up to 137 gigawatts of new wind and solar online by 2035.
ADVANTAGES OF HYDROPOWER:
Hydropower is a renewable source of energy. The energy generated through hydropower relies on the water cycle, which is driven by the sun, making it renewable.
Hydropower is fueled by water, making it a clean source of energy.
Hydroelectric power is a domestic source of energy, allowing each state to produce its own energy without being reliant on international fuel sources.
Impoundment hydropower creates reservoirs that offer recreational opportunities such as fishing, swimming, and boating. Most hydropower installations are required to provide some public access to the reservoir to allow the public to take advantage of these opportunities. 
Hydroelectric power is flexible. Some hydropower facilities can quickly go from zero power to maximum output. Because hydropower plants can generate power to the grid immediately, they provide essential backup power during major electricity outages or disruptions.
Hydropower provides benefits beyond electricity generation by providing flood control, irrigation support, and clean drinking water.
Hydropower is affordable. Hydropower provides low-cost electricity and durability over time compared to other sources of energy. Construction costs can even be mitigated by using preexisting structures such as bridges, tunnels, and dams.
Hydropower complements other renewable energy sources. Technologies like pumped storage hydropower (PSH) store energy to use in tandem with renewables such as wind and solar power when demand is high.
Hydropower is an established industry in the United States, employing 66,500 people(link is external). And there are a growing number of jobs(link is external) available in hydropower, including manufacturing, utilities, professional and business services, construction, trade and transportation, energy systems, water management, environmental science, welding, machinery, and other services.
The U.S. hydropower workforce(link is external) could grow to 120,000 jobs by 2030 and 158,000 by 2050. For those interested in becoming part of this workforce, hydropower education programs can be found nationwide.
Hydropower creates jobs(link is external) in rural locations and boosts local economies.

Glen Canyon Unit
Glen Canyon Dam, rising 710 feet above bedrock within the steep, rust-colored sand-stone walls of Glen Canyon, was constructed to harness the power of the Colorado River in order to provide for the water and power needs of millions of people in the West.
Water rushing from first two jet tubes opened for high-flow experiment at Glen Canyon Dam - March 5, 2008
Glen Canyon Dam is the second highest concrete-arch dam in the United States, second only to Hoover Dam which stands at 726 feet. The 25.16 million acre-feet of water storage capacity in Lake Powell, created by Glen Canyon Dam, serves as a ‘bank account’ of water that is drawn on in times of drought. This stored water has made it possible to successfully weather extended dry periods by sustaining the needs of cities, industries, and agriculture throughout the West.
Hydroelectric power produced by the dam’s eight generators helps meet the electrical needs of the West’s rapidly growing population. With a total capacity of 1,320 megawatts, Glen Canyon Powerplant produces around five billion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectric power annually which is distributed by the Western Area Power Administration to Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Nebraska. In addition, revenues from production of hydropower help fund many important environmental programs associated with Glen and Grand canyons.
The designation of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in 1972, underscores the value and importance of the recreation benefits associated with Lake Powell and the Colorado River downstream of the dam. The recreation area is managed by the National Park Service.
Glen Canyon Dam is the key water storage unit of the Colorado River Storage Project, one of the most complex and extensive river resource developments in the world. Without it, development of the Upper Colorado River Basin states’ portion of the Colorado River would not have been possible.

Lake Powell
Formed by the waters of the Colorado River behind Glen Canyon Dam, Lake Powell’s 1,960 miles of winding shoreline (when full) and 186 mile-length make it the second-largest reservoir in the United States. Lake Mead, formed by Hoover Dam is the largest.
Lake Powell began filling on March 13, 1963 and completed filling on June 22, 1980 reaching elevation 3,700 feet above sea level with a total capacity of over 25 million acre-feet of water. Lake Powell extends through the main corridor of Glen Canyon as well as into over 90 side canyons that extend outward.
Named after Major John Wesley Powell who successfully navigated the first expedition down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon in 1869, Lake Powell offers visitors spectacular scenery and numerous recreational opportunities. Managed by the National Park service, the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is visited by over 3 million people each year.
In addition to its significant recreation value, Lake Powell functions as a vast ‘bank account’ of water that can be drawn on during dry years. Lake Powell provides long-term carryover water storage that allows the Upper Basin states of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah to use their share of the Colorado River while still providing the required delivery of water to the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California, and Nevada. As drought conditions persist in the Southwest, the water storage in Lake Powell is especially critical.
As Lake Powell fulfills its intended purposes, it’s natural for the elevation of the lake to fluctuate depending on the amount of spring runoff from the mountains, deliveries to the Lower Basin, and the amount of water carried over from the previous year. Each year, the lake level increases between May and July from runoff followed by a decrease in lake level throughout the remainder of the year, leaving a visible ring along the shoreline. The amount of fluctuation varies each year but during extended periods of drought, Lake Powell’s elevation could drop by more than 200 feet below its maximum elevation.
Because of the many significant benefits provided by Lake Powell, Congress continues to include a direct prohibition concerning any planning actions or expenditure of public funds related to consideration or actions toward draining Lake Powell. Former Reclamation Commissioner, John W. Keys III said, ""Previous administrations of both political parties, as well as the U.S. Congress, have said that Glen Canyon Dam is here to stay because it is serving millions of people in the Southwestern United States. Congress, through the passage of the Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992, clearly stated that the dam and reservoir have a place in the tapestry of the country."" Reclamation is committed to operating Glen Canyon Dam in accordance with the Law of the River and all applicable environmental laws.

2021-2022 Hydropower Accomplishments
WHAT IS HYDROPOWER?
Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is one of the oldest and largest sources of renewable energy, which uses the natural flow of moving water to generate electricity. Hydropower currently accounts(link is external) for 28.7% of total U.S. renewable electricity generation and about 6.2% of total U.S. electricity generation. 
While most people might associate the energy source with the Hoover Dam—a huge facility harnessing the power of an entire river behind its wall—hydropower facilities come in all sizes. Some may be very large, but they can be tiny, too, taking advantage of water flows in municipal water facilities or irrigation ditches. They can even be “damless,” with diversions or run-of-river facilities that channel part of a stream through a powerhouse before the water rejoins the main river. Whatever the method, hydropower is much easier to obtain and more widely used than most people realize. In fact, all but two states (Delaware and Mississippi) use hydropower for electricity, some more than others. For example, in 2020 about 66%(link is external) of the state of Washington’s electricity came from hydropower. 
In a study led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on hydropower flexibility, preliminary analysis found that the firm capacity associated with U.S. hydropower’s flexibility is estimated to be over 24 GW. To replace this capability with storage would require the buildout of 24 GW of 10-hour storage—more than all the existing storage in the United States today. Additionally, in terms of integrating wind and solar, the flexibility presented in existing U.S. hydropower facilities could help bring up to 137 gigawatts of new wind and solar online by 2035.
HOW DOES HYDROPOWER WORK?
Hydropower technologies generate power by using the elevation difference,  created by a dam or diversion structure, of water flowing in on one side and out, far below, on the other. The Department of Energy's ""Hydropower 101"" video explains how hydropower works and highlights some of the research and development efforts of the Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO) in this area.

WHAT IS THE COST OF HYDROPOWER?
Hydropower is an affordable source of electricity that costs less than most. Since hydropower relies only on the energy from moving water, states that get the majority of their electricity from hydropower, like Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, have lower energy bills than the rest of the country.  
Compared to other electricity sources, hydropower also has relatively low costs throughout the duration of a full project lifetime in terms of maintenance, operations, and fuel. Like any major energy source, significant upfront costs are unavoidable, but hydropower’s longer lifespan spreads these costs out over time. Additionally, the equipment used at hydropower facilities often operates for longer periods of time without needing replacements or repairs, saving money in the long term.

The installation costs for large hydropower facilities consist mostly of civil construction works (such as the building of the dams, tunnels, and other necessary infrastructure) and electromechanical equipment costs (electricity-generating machinery). Since hydropower is a site-specific technology, these costs can be minimized at the planning stage through proper selection of location and design.
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HYDROPOWER?
The benefits of hydropower have been recognized and harnessed for thousands of years. In addition to being a clean and cost-effective form of energy, hydropower plants can provide power to the grid immediately, serving as a flexible and reliable form of backup power during major electricity outages or disruptions. Hydropower also produces a number of benefits outside of electricity generation, such as flood control, irrigation support, and water supply.
WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF HYDROPOWER?
The history of hydropower dates back thousands of years. For example, the Greeks used water wheels to grind wheat into flour more than 2,000 years ago. The evolution of the modern hydropower turbine began in the mid-1700s when a French hydraulic and military engineer, Bernard Forest de Bélidor, wrote Architecture Hydraulique. Many key developments in hydropower technology occurred during the first half of the 19th century, and more recently, the past century has seen a number of hydroelectric advancements that have helped hydropower become an integral part of the renewable energy mix in the United States.

Places to Go
Introduction
Located in the heart of the St. Anthony Falls and east bank milling district, this small park has great views of the falls. Interpretive panels describe the re-engineering of the falls from a natural cascade into one harnessed for industry.
History
The history of this area is largely about power: spiritual, physical, and political. Native American regarded the falls as having significant spiritual power. Logging interests floated logs south to the falls, where entrepreneurs built sawmills that tapped the power of the falling water to cut the logs into lumber. Other industrialists used the falls to power flour mills.
Both logging and flour industries declined, but St. Anthony Falls still represented a significant source of power and in 1882 a commercial hydroelectric power station harnessed the power of the falls at this location. The advent of hydroelectric power profoundly changed the way local communities developed. Energy-dependent businesses once had to be on the river bank to gain access to the power of falling water using turbines or waterwheels.
After the advent of hydroelectric power generation, businesses could tap the enormous power of the falls in the form of electric power transported through cables, allowing them to locate far away from the river.
Hydroelectric power would have great effects on the region and spur a national discussion about rivers and their uses. A growing nation would wrestle with who would control river resources, who would benefit, and how competing claims would be accommodated. This vital discussion continues to this day.
Water Power Park commemorates the nation’s first commercial hydroelectric generation station and how hydroelectric power changed the nation.
The St. Anthony Falls Hydroelectric Project, completed in 1908, generates 14 megawatts of electricity. It was constructed near the first commercial hydroelectric generating station and is located within the St. Anthony Falls Historic District.
The 1.4-acre park is owned and operated by Xcel Energy and was created as a condition of the federal relicensing of the St. Anthony Falls Hydroelectric Project.
Activities
Water Power Park has foot trails, bike paths and benches. Visitors obtain great views of the river and dam that tamed St. Anthony Falls. Interpretative panels illustrate the area’s rich history.

Hydropower (from Ancient Greek ὑδρο-, ""water""), also known as water power, is the use of falling or fast-running water to produce electricity or to power machines. This is achieved by converting the gravitational potential or kinetic energy of a water source to produce power.[1] Hydropower is a method of sustainable energy production. Hydropower is now used principally for hydroelectric power generation, and is also applied as one half of an energy storage system known as pumped-storage hydroelectricity.
Hydropower is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as it does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other atmospheric pollutants and it provides a relatively consistent source of power. Nonetheless, it has economic, sociological, and environmental downsides and requires a sufficiently energetic source of water, such as a river or elevated lake.[2] International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a low-carbon means for economic development.[3]
Since ancient times, hydropower from watermills has been used as a renewable energy source for irrigation and the operation of mechanical devices, such as gristmills, sawmills, textile mills, trip hammers, dock cranes, domestic lifts, and ore mills. A trompe, which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.[4][1]
Calculating the amount of available power[edit]
The Three Gorges Dam in China; the hydroelectric dam is the world's largest power station by installed capacity.
A hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available power. Power is a function of the hydraulic head and volumetric flow rate. The head is the energy per unit weight (or unit mass) of water.[5] The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls. Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.
The power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water, the height of fall, and the local acceleration due to gravity:
where
(work flow rate out) is the useful power output (SI unit: watts)
(""eta"") is the efficiency of the turbine (dimensionless)
is the mass flow rate (SI unit: kilograms per second)
(""rho"") is the density of water (SI unit: kilograms per cubic metre)
is the volumetric flow rate (SI unit: cubic metres per second)
is the acceleration due to gravity (SI unit: metres per second per second)
(""Delta h"") is the difference in height between the outlet and inlet (SI unit: metres)
To illustrate, the power output of a turbine that is 85% efficient, with a flow rate of 80 cubic metres per second (2800 cubic feet per second) and a head of 145 metres (476 feet), is 97 megawatts:[note 1]
Operators of hydroelectric stations compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency. Procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as ASME PTC 18 and IEC 60041. Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer's efficiency guarantee. Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine accounts for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock, rise in tailwater level due to flow, the location of the station and effect of varying gravity, the air temperature and barometric pressure, the density of the water at ambient temperature, and the relative altitudes of the forebay and tailbay. For precise calculations, errors due to rounding and the number of significant digits of constants must be considered.[6]
Some hydropower systems such as water wheels can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the kinetic energy of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy.[7] The flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season. The development of a hydropower site requires analysis of flow records, sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However, reservoirs have a significant environmental impact, as does alteration of naturally occurring streamflow. Dam design must account for the worst-case, ""probable maximum flood"" that can be expected at the site; a spillway is often included to route flood flows around the dam. A computer model of the hydraulic basin and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.[citation needed]
Disadvantages and limitations[edit]
Main articles: Hydroelectricity § Disadvantages, and Renewable energy debate § Hydroelectricity
Some disadvantages of hydropower have been identified. Dam failures can have catastrophic effects, including loss of life, property and pollution of land.
Dams and reservoirs can have major negative impacts on river ecosystems such as preventing some animals traveling upstream, cooling and de-oxygenating of water released downstream, and loss of nutrients due to settling of particulates.[8] River sediment builds river deltas and dams prevent them from restoring what is lost from erosion.[9][10] Furthermore, studies found that the construction of dams and reservoirs can result in habitat loss for some aquatic species.[11]

Large and deep dam and reservoir plants cover large areas of land which causes greenhouse gas emissions from underwater rotting vegetation. Furthermore, although at lower levels than other renewable energy sources, it was found that hydropower produces methane gas which is a greenhouse gas. This occurs when organic matters accumulate at the bottom of the reservoir because of the deoxygenation of water which triggers anaerobic digestion.[12]
People who live near a hydro plant site are displaced during construction or when reservoir banks become unstable.[11] Another potential disadvantage is cultural or religious sites may block construction.[11][note 2]

Mechanical power[edit]
Watermills[edit]
This section is an excerpt from Watermill.[edit]
Watermill of Braine-le-Château, Belgium (12th century)
Interior of the Lyme Regis watermill, UK (14th century)
A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower. It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. These watermills may comprise gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills.
One major way to classify watermills is by wheel orientation (vertical or horizontal), one powered by a vertical waterwheel through a gear mechanism, and the other equipped with a horizontal waterwheel without such a mechanism. The former type can be further divided, depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles, into undershot, overshot, breastshot and pitchback (backshot or reverse shot) waterwheel mills. Another way to classify water mills is by an essential trait about their location: tide mills use the movement of the tide; ship mills are water mills onboard (and constituting) a ship.
Watermills impact the river dynamics of the watercourses where they are installed. During the time watermills operate channels tend to sedimentate, particularly backwater.[13] Also in the backwater area, inundation events and sedimentation of adjacent floodplains increase. Over time however these effects are cancelled by river banks becoming higher.[13] Where mills have been removed, river incision increases and channels deepen.[13]
Compressed air[edit]
See also: Trompe
A plentiful head of water can be made to generate compressed air directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is deliberately mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This allows it to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the Montreal River at Ragged Shutes near Cobalt, Ontario, in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.[14]
Electricity[edit]
Main article: Hydroelectricity
Hydroelectricity is the biggest hydropower application. Hydroelectricity generates about 15% of global electricity and provides at least 50% of the total electricity supply for more than 35 countries.[15] In 2021, global installed hydropower electrical capacity reached almost 1400 GW, the highest among all renewable energy technologies.[16]
Hydroelectricity generation starts with converting either the potential energy of water that is present due to the site's elevation or the kinetic energy of moving water into electrical energy.[12]
Hydroelectric power plants vary in terms of the way they harvest energy. One type involves a dam and a reservoir. The water in the reservoir is available on demand to be used to generate electricity by passing through channels that connect the dam to the reservoir. The water spins a turbine, which is connected to the generator that produces electricity.[12]
The other type is called a run-of-river plant. In this case, a barrage is built to control the flow of water, absent a reservoir. The run-of river power plant needs continuous water flow and therefore has less ability to provide power on demand. The kinetic energy of flowing water is the main source of energy.[12]
Both designs have limitations. For example, dam construction can result in discomfort to nearby residents. The dam and reservoirs occupy a relatively large amount of space that may be opposed by nearby communities.[17] Moreover, reservoirs can potentially have major environmental consequences such as harming downstream habitats.[12] On the other hand, the limitation of the run-of-river project is the decreased efficiency of electricity generation because the process depends on the speed of the seasonal river flow. This means that the rainy season increases electricity generation compared to the dry season.[18]
The size of hydroelectric plants can vary from small plants called micro hydro, to large plants that supply power to a whole country. As of 2019, the five largest power stations in the world are conventional hydroelectric power stations with dams.[19]
Hydroelectricity can also be used to store energy in the form of potential energy between two reservoirs at different heights with pumped-storage. Water is pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.[20]
Other forms of electricity generation with hydropower include tidal stream generators using energy from tidal power generated from oceans, rivers, and human-made canal systems to generating electricity.[12]
A conventional dammed-hydro facility (hydroelectric dam) is the most common type of hydroelectric power generation.

Rain power[edit]
Rain has been referred to as ""one of the last unexploited energy sources in nature. When it rains, billions of litres of water can fall, which have enormous electric potential if used in the right way.""[21] Research is being done into the different methods of generating power from rain, such as by using the energy in the impact of raindrops. This is in its very early stages with new and emerging technologies being tested, prototyped and created. Such power has been called rain power.[22][23] One method in which this has been attempted is by using hybrid solar panels called ""all-weather solar panels"" that can generate electricity from both the sun and the rain.[24]
According to zoologist and science and technology educator, Luis Villazon, ""A 2008 French study estimated that you could use piezoelectric devices, which generate power when they move, to extract 12 milliwatts from a raindrop. Over a year, this would amount to less than 0.001kWh per square metre – enough to power a remote sensor."" Villazon suggested a better application would be to collect the water from fallen rain and use it to drive a turbine, with an estimated energy generation of 3 kWh of energy per year for a 185 m2 roof.[25] A microturbine-based system created by three students from the Technological University of Mexico has been used to generate electricity. The Pluvia system ""uses the stream of rainwater runoff from houses' rooftop rain gutters to spin a microturbine in a cylindrical housing. Electricity generated by that turbine is used to charge 12-volt batteries.""[26]
The term rain power has also been applied to hydropower systems which include the process of capturing the rain.[21][25]
History[edit]
Ancient history[edit]

Directly water-powered ore mill, late nineteenth century
Evidence suggests that the fundamentals of hydropower date to ancient Greek civilization.[27] Other evidence indicates that the waterwheel independently emerged in China around the same period.[27] Evidence of water wheels and watermills date to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC.[28]: 14  Moreover, evidence indicates the use of hydropower using irrigation machines to ancient civilizations such as Sumer and Babylonia.[11] Studies suggest that the water wheel was the initial form of water power and it was driven by either humans or animals.[11]
In the Roman Empire, water-powered mills were described by Vitruvius by the first century BC.[29] The Barbegal mill, located in modern-day France, had 16 water wheels processing up to 28 tons of grain per day.[4] Roman waterwheels were also used for sawing marble such as the Hierapolis sawmill of the late 3rd century AD.[30] Such sawmills had a waterwheel that drove two crank-and-connecting rods to power two saws. It also appears in two 6th century Eastern Roman sawmills excavated at Ephesus and Gerasa respectively. The crank and connecting rod mechanism of these Roman watermills converted the rotary motion of the waterwheel into the linear movement of the saw blades.[31]
Water-powered trip hammers and bellows in China, during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), were initially thought to be powered by water scoops.[28]: 26–30  However, some historians suggested that they were powered by waterwheels. This is since it was theorized that water scoops would not have had the motive force to operate their blast furnace bellows.[32] Many texts describe the Hun waterwheel; some of the earliest ones are the Jijiupian dictionary of 40 BC, Yang Xiong's text known as the Fangyan of 15 BC, as well as Xin Lun, written by Huan Tan about 20 AD.[33] It was also during this time that the engineer Du Shi (c. AD 31) applied the power of waterwheels to piston-bellows in forging cast iron.[33]
Another example of the early use of hydropower is seen in hushing, a historic method of mining that uses flood or torrent of water to reveal mineral veins. The method was first used at the Dolaucothi Gold Mines in Wales from 75 AD onwards. This method was further developed in Spain in mines such as Las Médulas. Hushing was also widely used in Britain in the Medieval and later periods to extract lead and tin ores. It later evolved into hydraulic mining when used during the California Gold Rush in the 19th century.[34]
The Islamic Empire spanned a large region, mainly in Asia and Africa, along with other surrounding areas.[35] During the Islamic Golden Age and the Arab Agricultural Revolution (8th–13th centuries), hydropower was widely used and developed. Early uses of tidal power emerged along with large hydraulic factory complexes.[36] A wide range of water-powered industrial mills were used in the region including fulling mills, gristmills, paper mills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, and tide mills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic Empire had these industrial mills in operation, from Al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia.[37]: 10  Muslim engineers also used water turbines while employing gears in watermills and water-raising machines. They also pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.[38]
Furthermore, in his book, The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, the Muslim mechanical engineer, Al-Jazari (1136–1206) described designs for 50 devices. Many of these devices were water-powered, including clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools, where three of them are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water. Moreover, they included an endless belt with jugs attached, a cow-powered shadoof (a crane-like irrigation tool), and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.[39]
Benoît Fourneyron, the French engineer who developed the first hydropower turbine
19th century[edit]
In the 19th century, French engineer Benoît Fourneyron developed the first hydropower turbine. This device was implemented in the commercial plant of Niagara Falls in 1895 and it is still operating.[11] In the early 20th century, English engineer William Armstrong built and operated the first private electrical power station which was located in his house in Cragside in Northumberland, England.[11] In 1753, the French engineer Bernard Forest de Bélidor published his book, Architecture Hydraulique, which described vertical-axis and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines.[40]
The growing demand for the Industrial Revolution would drive development as well.[41] At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, water was the main power source for new inventions such as Richard Arkwright's water frame.[42] Although water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories, it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations, such as driving the bellows in small blast furnaces (e.g. the Dyfi Furnace) and gristmills, such as those built at Saint Anthony Falls, which uses the 50-foot (15 m) drop in the Mississippi River.[43][42]
Technological advances moved the open water wheel into an enclosed turbine or water motor. In 1848, the British-American engineer James B. Francis, head engineer of Lowell's Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency.[44] He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design. His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions. The Francis reaction turbine is still in use. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry, Lester Allan Pelton developed the high-efficiency Pelton wheel impulse turbine, which used hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the Sierra Nevada.[citation needed]
20th century[edit]
The modern history of hydropower begins in the 1900s, with large dams built not simply to power neighboring mills or factories[45] but provide extensive electricity for increasingly distant groups of people. Competition drove much of the global hydroelectric craze: Europe competed amongst itself to electrify first, and the United States' hydroelectric plants in Niagara Falls and the Sierra Nevada inspired bigger and bolder creations across the globe.[46] American and USSR financers and hydropower experts also spread the gospel of dams and hydroelectricity across the globe during the Cold War, contributing to projects such as the Three Gorges Dam and the Aswan High Dam.[47] Feeding desire for large scale electrification with water inherently required large dams across powerful rivers,[48] which impacted public and private interests downstream and in flood zones.[49] Inevitably smaller communities and marginalized groups suffered. They were unable to successfully resist companies flooding them out of their homes or blocking traditional salmon passages.[50] The stagnant water created by hydroelectric dams provides breeding ground for pests and pathogens, leading to local epidemics.[51] However, in some cases, a mutual need for hydropower could lead to cooperation between otherwise adversarial nations.[52]
Hydropower technology and attitude began to shift in the second half of the 20th century. While countries had largely abandoned their small hydropower systems by the 1930s, the smaller hydropower plants began to make a comeback in the 1970s, boosted by government subsidies and a push for more independent energy producers.[48] Some politicians who once advocated for large hydropower projects in the first half of the 20th century began to speak out against them, and citizen groups organizing against dam projects increased.[53]
In the 1980s and 90s the international anti-dam movement had made finding government or private investors for new large hydropower projects incredibly difficult, and given rise to NGOs devoted to fighting dams.[54] Additionally, while the cost of other energy sources fell, the cost of building new hydroelectric dams increased 4% annually between 1965 and 1990, due both to the increasing costs of construction and to the decrease in high quality building sites.[55] In the 1990s, only 18% of the world's electricity came from hydropower.[56] Tidal power production also emerged in the 1960s as a burgeoning alternative hydropower system, though still has not taken hold as a strong energy contender.[57]
United States[edit]
Especially at the start of the American hydropower experiment, engineers and politicians began major hydroelectricity projects to solve a problem of 'wasted potential' rather than to power a population that needed the electricity. When the Niagara Falls Power Company began looking into damming Niagara, the first major hydroelectric project in the United States, in the 1890s they struggled to transport electricity from the falls far enough away to actually reach enough people and justify installation. The project succeeded in large part due to Nikola Tesla's invention of the alternating current motor.[58][59] On the other side of the country, San Francisco engineers, the Sierra Club, and the federal government fought over acceptable use of the Hetch Hetchy Valley. Despite ostensible protection within a national park, city engineers successfully won the rights to both water and power in the Hetch Hetchy Valley in 1913. After their victory they delivered Hetch Hetchy hydropower and water to San Francisco a decade later and at twice the promised cost, selling power to PG&E which resold to San Francisco residents at a profit.[60][61][62]
The American West, with its mountain rivers and lack of coal, turned to hydropower early and often, especially along the Columbia River and its tributaries. The Bureau of Reclamation built the Hoover Dam in 1931, symbolically linking the job creation and economic growth priorities of the New Deal.[63] The federal government quickly followed Hoover with the Shasta Dam and Grand Coulee Dam. Power demand in Oregon did not justify damming the Columbia until WWI revealed the weaknesses of a coal-based energy economy. The federal government then began prioritizing interconnected power—and lots of it.[64] Electricity from all three dams poured into war production during WWII.[65]
After the war, the Grand Coulee Dam and accompanying hydroelectric projects electrified almost all of the rural Columbia Basin, but failed to improve the lives of those living and farming there the way its boosters had promised and also damaged the river ecosystem and migrating salmon populations. In the 1940s as well, the federal government took advantage of the sheer amount of unused power and flowing water from the Grand Coulee to build a nuclear site placed on the banks of the Columbia. The nuclear site leaked radioactive matter into the river, contaminating the entire area.[66]
Post-WWII Americans, especially engineers from the Tennessee Valley Authority, refocused from simply building domestic dams to promoting hydropower abroad.[67][68] While domestic dam building continued well into the 1970s, with the Reclamation Bureau and Army Corps of Engineers building more than 150 new dams across the American West,[67] organized opposition to hydroelectric dams sparked up in the 1950s and 60s based on environmental concerns. Environmental movements successfully shut down proposed hydropower dams in Dinosaur National Monument and the Grand Canyon, and gained more hydropower-fighting tools with 1970s environmental legislation. As nuclear and fossil fuels grew in the 70s and 80s and environmental activists push for river restoration, hydropower gradually faded in American importance.[69]
Africa[edit]
Foreign powers and IGOs have frequently used hydropower projects in Africa as a tool to interfere in the economic development of African countries, such as the World Bank with the Kariba and Akosombo Dams, and the Soviet Union with the Aswan Dam.[70] The Nile River especially has borne the consequences of countries both along the Nile and distant foreign actors using the river to expand their economic power or national force. After the British occupation of Egypt in 1882, the British worked with Egypt to construct the first Aswan Dam,[71] which they heightened in 1912 and 1934 to try to hold back the Nile floods. Egyptian engineer Adriano Daninos developed a plan for the Aswan High Dam, inspired by the Tennessee Valley Authority's multipurpose dam.
When Gamal Abdel Nasser took power in the 1950s, his government decided to undertake the High Dam project, publicizing it as an economic development project.[68] After American refusal to help fund the dam, and anti-British sentiment in Egypt and British interests in neighboring Sudan combined to make the United Kingdom pull out as well, the Soviet Union funded the Aswan High Dam.[72] Between 1977 and 1990 the dam's turbines generated one third of Egypt's electricity.[73] The building of the Aswan Dam triggered a dispute between Sudan and Egypt over the sharing of the Nile, especially since the dam flooded part of Sudan and decreased the volume of water available to them. Ethiopia, also located on the Nile, took advantage of the Cold War tensions to request assistance from the United States for their own irrigation and hydropower investments in the 1960s.[74] While progress stalled due to the coup d'état of 1974 and following 17-year-long Ethiopian Civil War Ethiopia began construction on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in 2011.[75]
Beyond the Nile, hydroelectric projects cover the rivers and lakes of Africa. The Inga powerplant on the Congo River had been discussed since Belgian colonization in the late 19th century, and was successfully built after independence. Mobutu's government failed to regularly maintain the plants and their capacity declined until the 1995 formation of the Southern African Power Pool created a multi-national power grid and plant maintenance program.[76] States with an abundance of hydropower, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana, frequently sell excess power to neighboring countries.[77] Foreign actors such as Chinese hydropower companies have proposed a significant amount of new hydropower projects in Africa,[78] and already funded and consulted on many others in countries like Mozambique and Ghana.[77]
Small hydropower also played an important role in early 20th century electrification across Africa. In South Africa, small turbines powered gold mines and the first electric railway in the 1890s, and Zimbabwean farmers installed small hydropower stations in the 1930s. While interest faded as national grids improved in the second half of the century, 21st century national governments in countries including South Africa and Mozambique, as well as NGOs serving countries like Zimbabwe, have begun re-exploring small-scale hydropower to diversify power sources and improve rural electrification.[79]
Europe[edit]
In the early 20th century, two major factors motivated the expansion of hydropower in Europe: in the northern countries of Norway and Sweden high rainfall and mountains proved exceptional resources for abundant hydropower, and in the south coal shortages pushed governments and utility companies to seek alternative power sources.[80]
Early on, Switzerland dammed the Alpine rivers and the Swiss Rhine, creating, along with Italy and Scandinavia, a Southern Europe hydropower race.[81] In Italy's Po Valley, the main 20th century transition was not the creation of hydropower but the transition from mechanical to electrical hydropower. 12,000 watermills churned in the Po watershed in the 1890s, but the first commercial hydroelectric plant, completed in 1898, signaled the end of the mechanical reign.[82] These new large plants moved power away from rural mountainous areas to urban centers in the lower plain. Italy prioritized early near-nationwide electrification, almost entirely from hydropower, which powered their rise as a dominant European and imperial force. However, they failed to reach any conclusive standard for determining water rights before WWI.[83][82]
Modern German hydropower dam construction built off a history of small dams powering mines and mills going back to the 15th century. Some parts of Germany industry even relied more on waterwheels than steam until the 1870s.[84] The German government did not set out building large dams such as the prewar Urft, Mohne, and Eder dams to expand hydropower: they mostly wanted to reduce flooding and improve navigation.[85] However, hydropower quickly emerged as an added bonus for all these dams, especially in the coal-poor south. Bavaria even achieved a statewide power grid by damming the Walchensee in 1924, inspired in part by loss of coal reserves after WWI.[86]
Hydropower became a symbol of regional pride and distaste for northern 'coal barons', although the north also held strong enthusiasm for hydropower.[87] Dam building rapidly increased after WWII, this time with the express purpose of increasing hydropower.[88] However, conflict accompanied the dam building and spread of hydropower: agrarian interests suffered from decreased irrigation, small mills lost water flow, and different interest groups fought over where dams should be located, controlling who benefited and whose homes they drowned.[89]

Overview
South Dakota stretches from fertile lowlands in the eastern part of the state across rolling hills, canyons, and buttes to the state's famous Badlands and Black Hills in the west. The state's modest crude oil and natural gas reserves are concentrated in western South Dakota.1,2,3,4 However, substantial renewable resources are found statewide. The Missouri River, the longest river in North America, cuts across central South Dakota and, along with its many tributaries, provides the state with abundant hydroelectric resources.5 Four of the six major hydroelectric dams along the Missouri River are located in South Dakota.6 Winds that blow unobstructed across the state's broad plains and prairie provide a significant wind energy resource.7,8 Solar resources are found statewide but are greatest in southwestern South Dakota, and much of the western two-thirds of the state also has geothermal resources.9,10 Biomass, from the state's more than 43 million acres of farmland and from its western forests, provides additional renewable resources.11,12,13 Uranium, the source for nuclear reactor fuel, was found in western South Dakota in the early 1950s. Although it is not currently mined in the state, a uranium in-situ leach mining project is in development.14,15
South Dakota’s industrial sector accounts for more than two-fifths of the state’s total energy use.
The industrial sector, which accounts for more than two-fifths of state total energy use, is South Dakota's leading energy consumer, and agriculture is the state's primary industry.16,17 In addition to farming and food production, the state's manufactured products include machinery, chemicals, fabricated metal products, and transportation equipment.18 The Black Hills, along the state's western border, are a mineral-rich area with gold, silver, copper, and lead deposits. South Dakota's Homestake Mine had the largest single gold deposit ever found in the Western Hemisphere and produced more than 40 million ounces of gold during its 125-year history. In 2001, the mine closed, and it became an important deep underground scientific research site. South Dakota is still a leading gold producer. Other large-scale energy-intensive mining activities continue in the state, including the extraction of sand, gravel, crushed stone, clays, granite, limestone, and gypsum. Natural gas and crude oil production contribute to the state's energy-intensive mining activities as well.19,20,21
South Dakota's transportation sector accounts for one-fourth of state total energy consumption, and the residential and commercial sectors split the remaining one-third.22 In part because South Dakota has one of the smallest populations of any state, its total energy consumption is among the lowest in the nation.23,24 However, because of its energy-intensive industries and a climate typified by hot summers and exceptionally cold winters, South Dakota is among the top 10 energy-consuming states in the nation on a per capita basis.25,26
Electricity
In 2022, South Dakota’s electricity generation was three times greater than it was in 2007, primarily because of wind power.
South Dakota's total electricity net generation was three times greater in 2022 than it was in 2007, primarily because of increased generation from wind. In 2022, wind provided more than half the state's total electricity net generation, up from about one-fifth in 2019. In 2021, wind surpassed the state's previous leading electricity source, hydroelectric power, for the first time, when 6 of the 10 largest power plants in South Dakota by generation were wind powered.27 Hydropower had been the state's most important energy resource until that time. Three of South Dakota's four largest power plants by capacity and the two largest by generation are hydroelectric facilities located on the upper Missouri River and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.28 The northernmost is the Oahe Dam, which forms a 231-mile-long lake that is the fourth-largest man-made reservoir in the nation. It began generating hydroelectric power in 1962. Downstream is the Big Bend Dam, whose power plant went into operation in 1964. The Fort Randall Dam, just north of the Nebraska state line, is the oldest of the three and first produced power in March 1954. Water released from those and other upstream dams is stored in Lewis and Clark Lake behind South Dakota's fourth large federal dam, Gavins Point. That dam straddles the border between South Dakota and Nebraska; however, its power plant is on the Nebraska side. The Gavins Point Dam plays an important role in controlling the water flow on the 800 miles of open river between the South Dakota border and St. Louis, Missouri.29 The state's only other utility-scale (1 megawatt or larger capacity) hydroelectric power plant has 4 megawatts of generating capacity and has been in operation since 1912.30 South Dakota's remaining net generation comes almost entirely from coal and natural gas. Coal's contribution declined from more than half of the state's net generation in 2008 to about one-tenth in 2022. Natural gas' share of South Dakota's net generation was almost 6% in 2022. Petroleum, biomass, and solar energy also contributed small amounts.31 South Dakota does not have any nuclear power plants.32
South Dakota population is less than in all but four other states, and it consumes less electricity than all but seven other states.33,34 However, South Dakota's per capita electricity consumption is greater than in 35 of the states.35 Electricity sales have steadily increased for more than two decades. In 2022, the residential sector accounted for 40% of the state's electricity sales, followed closely by the commercial sector at 37%. The rest was purchased by the industrial sector.36 Per capita electricity sales to South Dakota's residential sector are more than in almost three-fourths of the states, in part because one in three households uses electricity for home heating during the state's extremely cold winters.37,38,39
Renewable energy
In 2022, wind supplied 55% of the South Dakota’s total in-state net generation, a larger share than in all other states except Iowa.
Renewable resources supplied more than four-fifths (84%) of South Dakota's total in-state electricity generation in 2022, almost all of it from wind and hydroelectric power. After surpassing hydroelectric power's contribution to in-state electricity generation in 2021, wind provided nearly twice as much electricity as hydropower in 2022.40 The state has some of the best onshore wind resources in the nation, and in 2022, wind supplied 55% of South Dakota's total in-state net generation, a larger share than in all other states except Iowa.41,42 In early 2023, South Dakota had almost 2,800 megawatts of wind energy capacity at 23 active wind farms.43,44 A 200-megawatt wind farm is being built and is expected to be operational by the end of 2023.45 Hydropower accounted for 29% of the state's total electricity generation in 2022, down from 41% in 2020, in large part because of the increase in generation at the state's wind facilities.46
South Dakota's agricultural activities and forest waste provide the state with important renewable resources. South Dakota is one of the nation's top corn producers, and the abundant corn crop is used, in part, to supply the feedstock for the state's fuel ethanol production industry.47,48 South Dakota is among the top five fuel ethanol producers in the nation, accounting for about 9% of the U.S. total.49,50 The state's 16 fuel ethanol plants can produce about 34 million barrels per year. Only about 1.2 million barrels of fuel ethanol are consumed in the state.51,52 There are no biodiesel production plants in South Dakota.53
Almost half of South Dakota‘s agricultural economy comes from raising livestock, primarily cattle and hogs.54 There are several renewable natural gas (RNG) projects in South Dakota that use animal manure from some of the state's farms to produce biogas.55,56 The city of Sioux Falls also uses biogas created by anaerobic digestion at its water reclamation facility to generate enough electricity to meet about 40% of the facility's needs.57 In 2022, biomass was used to fuel about 0.1% of South Dakota's in-state electricity generation.58 Wood pellets, also known as densified biomass, are manufactured from forest and mill waste and can be used for electricity generation and space heating.59 One fuel ethanol plant in the state uses wood waste to generate power for the plant's own use.60 South Dakota has two wood pellet manufacturing plants that have a combined production capacity of about 70,000 tons per year.61
There are additional renewable resources in South Dakota. Moderate solar photovoltaic (PV) potential exists across most of the state, with the greatest solar resources in the southwest corner of South Dakota.62 However, the state has only small amounts of solar electricity generation, and half of it is from customer-sited, small-scale (less than 1 megawatt capacity) installations, such as rooftop solar panels.63 South Dakota's only utility-scale (1-megawatt or larger) solar farm, a 1-megawatt facility, came online in 2016. An 80-megawatt solar farm is under construction in the southwest corner of the state and is scheduled to go online in late 2023.64 Geothermal energy is used in direct heat applications in South Dakota, such as district heating through distribution networks. It is also used to heat individual spas, swimming pools, residences, barns, and other buildings.65 However, there is no utility-scale electricity generation from geothermal energy in the state.66
In 2008, South Dakota's legislature established a voluntary renewable portfolio objective. Renewable and recycled energy resources, and later energy conservation, were to provide 10% of all electricity retail sales in the state by 2015. Many, but not all, of South Dakota's electricity providers met that goal. Those who did not noted barriers that limited their ability to do so, including lack of transmission capacity for renewable projects, intermittent nature of renewable power, competition from other fuels, and distance from renewable resources.67,68 South Dakota does have other state and utility policies, financial incentives, and technical resources that encourage energy efficiency and renewable electricity generation. The state also has interconnection standards for systems as large as 10-megawatts but does not have net metering rules, and interconnection costs are usually paid by the generating system owner.69,70
Petroleum
South Dakota has no significant proved crude oil reserves and no oil refineries, but it does have a small amount of crude oil production.71,72,73 Although the Williston Basin extends into South Dakota from the north, its oil-rich Bakken Shale does not.74 Almost all of the state's crude oil production is concentrated in the northwestern corner of the state, where Harding County produces most of South Dakota's crude oil and natural gas.75 Since the 1980s, the state's annual crude oil production has ranged between about 1 million and 2 million barrels per year. It declined from a peak of nearly 1.9 million barrels in 2013 to less than 1 million barrels in 2022, the lowest level since at least 1981.76 Crude oil production in South Dakota accounts for about 0.02% of the nation's total.77 Two crude oil pipelines that cross eastern South Dakota transport oil to refineries and terminals in other states.78 The route of a proposed third crude oil pipeline, the Keystone XL, was designed to provide a shortcut to transport oil produced from the Canadian tar sands and from the U.S. Bakken shale to a pipeline interconnect in Nebraska. The planned route ran diagonally across South Dakota. However, in 2021, the Biden administration revoked the 2019 presidential permit for construction of that pipeline.79,80 Other petroleum product pipelines bring refined products to South Dakota consumers through neighboring states.81
South Dakota uses less total petroleum than all but three other states and the District of Columbia. However, because of the state's small population, it uses more petroleum per capita than all but eight other states.82 The transportation sector accounts for more than three-fourths of the state's petroleum consumption, most of it as motor gasoline and diesel fuel.83,84 In part because of its relatively low population density and lack of access to alternative forms of public transportation, the state has a high number of vehicle miles traveled per capita.85 As a result, it is one of only a handful of states with significantly higher motor gasoline expenditures per capita than the U.S. average—it ranked fourth-highest in 2021.86 South Dakota does not have any U.S. Environmental Protection Agency air quality non-attainment areas, and conventional gasoline without ethanol can be sold statewide.87 However, like most states, almost all gasoline sold in South Dakota is blended with at least 10% ethanol.88 There also are about 80 fueling stations in South Dakota that sell E85, a motor gasoline blend that is 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.89 The industrial sector and the residential sector consume almost all the rest of the petroleum used in the state. In 2021, the industrial sector accounted for about 16% of state consumption. The residential sector, where about one in six South Dakota households use petroleum products, mostly propane, for heating, accounted for 5% of the state's petroleum use. The commercial sector used about 2%. The electric power sector uses a minimal amount of petroleum, primarily as a backup fuel when additional power is needed.90,91
Natural gas
South Dakota does not have any significant proved natural gas reserves, and with fewer than 100 producing wells natural gas production in the state is modest.92,93,94 Natural gas is produced from both natural gas and crude oil wells in Harding County in the northwest corner of South Dakota.95 Gross withdrawals of natural gas in the state increased steadily from 1980 until 2013 when they reached an annual high of more than 16 billion cubic feet. They remained near that level through 2015, but then rapidly decreased as the number of producing wells declined.96 Since 2016, South Dakota has produced less than 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per year and accounts for much less than 0.01% of U.S. natural gas gross withdrawals.97,98
In part because of its small population, South Dakota uses little natural gas. However, more natural gas is consumed in the state than is produced there.99,100 The industrial sector is South Dakota's largest natural gas-consuming sector. In 2022, it accounted for 57% of the natural gas delivered to the state's consumers. Although almost half of South Dakota households use natural gas as their primary fuel for home heating, the residential sector accounted for only about 17% of the natural gas delivered to state consumers.101 The commercial sector used 15% and the electric power sector used about 11%.102
South Dakota does not have any intrastate pipelines other than local distribution systems owned by natural gas utilities. A handful of major interstate pipelines bring natural gas into the state.103,104 Almost all the natural gas that enters the state comes from North Dakota. South Dakota does not have any underground natural gas storage fields, and nine-tenths of the natural gas that enters South Dakota leaves the state. Almost all of it continues on to Minnesota.105,106
Coal
South Dakota does not have any coal mines and the state's estimated recoverable coal reserves are small, less than 300 million tons.107 Coal arrives from Wyoming by rail and truck to meet the state's limited needs.108 In 2021, about 83% of the 1.3 million tons of coal consumed in South Dakota was used for electricity generation at the state's only coal-fired power plant.109 The rest of the coal was delivered to industrial facilities in the state.110
Energy on tribal lands
Native Americans account for almost one-tenth of South Dakota's population, and tribes or individual tribal members hold almost one-tenth of the state's land. South Dakota has the fifth-largest amount of acreage in tribal hands in the nation.111 The tribes on the Pine Ridge, Cheyenne River, Rosebud, and Standing Rock reservations are among the largest tribal landholders in the lower 48 states.112 South Dakota is home to nine federally recognized tribes on nine reservations. Two of the reservations straddle the North Dakota-South Dakota border.113
South Dakota's tribal lands have some of the best onshore wind resources in the nation. Four of the nation's top five reservations with the greatest wind-powered electricity generation potential are in South Dakota.114 In 2003, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe installed a 750-kilowatt wind turbine. It was the first tribe-owned and -operated commercial wind turbine that large in the Lower 48 states.115 In 2013, six South Dakota Sioux tribes announced plans to collaborate in the development of an interconnected grid of wind farms that would have more than 1,000 megawatts of generating capacity.116 To expedite development of the wind project, including transmission lines, the six tribes formed a Multi-Tribal Power Authority. The wind farm locations were selected because they are near existing transmission lines.117 Phase one of the development, with its first two interconnected wind power projects, has a planned combined capacity of 570 megawatts from the two sites. The 450-megawatt site on the Cheyenne River Reservation in north-central South Dakota and the 120-megawatt site on the southwestern Pine Ridge Reservation were initially expected to come online in 2021 but have experienced delays.118 The 120-megawatt site is now expected to come online in late 2024 and the 450-megawatt site is expected to be completed in 2026.119,120
South Dakota tribes also have biomass and solar resources. The Sisseton Tribe of northeastern South Dakota is one of the five tribes in the nation with the greatest potential for biomass-fueled electricity generation. The Pine Ridge reservation of southwestern South Dakota and northern Nebraska has some of the largest potential for concentrated solar power generating potential in the nation. The Standing Rock reservation that straddles the North and South Dakota border is one of the five reservations with the greatest utility-scale solar PV power potential in the nation.121 A planned solar farm on 810 acres leased from tribal members of the Pine Ridge reservation could provide up to 140 megawatts of power to the regional electric grid. It would be the state's largest solar farm to date.122 Other smaller solar projects are in development on South Dakota tribal lands. In 2018, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Tribal Utilities Commission received a U.S Department of Energy (DOE) grant to deploy 250 kilowatts of solar PV in Rosebud, and, in 2019, DOE awarded the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe a grant to expedite the installation of a total of 318 kilowatts of solar PV in Flandreau. In 2020, Oglala Sioux (Lakota) Housing received a grant to install about 55 kilowatts of solar PV capacity on the Pine Ridge Reservation.123 Individual tribal members on several reservations in South Dakota have installed small-scale, customer-sited solar PV systems.124,125

Description
This photograph shows an aerial view of the Hoover Dam with a power station at the top. On one side of the dam, there is visible water, while on the other side, there is none. The Hoover Dam is on the border between Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The Hoover Dam generates, on average, about 4 billion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectric power each year for use in Nevada, Arizona, and California - enough to serve 1.3 million people.

Overview
Washington generates more hydroelectric power than any other state.
Washington State borders Canada and is the furthest northwest of the Lower 48 states. The Pacific Ocean forms the state's western boundary.1 The Columbia River, second only to the Mississippi in volume of water flow among the nation's rivers, enters Washington near the state's northeastern corner and flows in an arc through the eastern half of the state. It forms much of the boundary between Washington and Oregon and drains all of eastern Washington and the western slopes of the Cascade Range south of Mt. Rainier.2 The river provides water for vast hydroelectric projects including Washington's Grand Coulee Dam, one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world, and helps make the state the nation's largest hydroelectric power producer.3,4,5 Washington's climate ranges from rainforest in the extreme western part of the state, where the heaviest precipitation in the continental United States occurs, to near desert conditions in areas east of the Cascade Range.6 Crop residues from Washington's agricultural areas in the east and those from the state's western forests provide ample biomass resources, and many areas of the state have significant wind power development potential.7,8 Even though the state has few fossil fuel resources, its five petroleum refineries provide the only crude oil refining capacity in the Pacific Northwest.9,10,11 Washington also is the only Pacific state other than California that generates nuclear power.12
Washington's economy developed around logging, fishing, and agriculture.13 Today, the state's top industries include: real estate; information and information technology; manufacturing, particularly of transportation equipment; and professional, scientific, technical, and business services.14 Washington is a leader in the energy-intensive forest products industry and in the aerospace industry, including the manufacture of aircraft.15 In 2020, the transportation sector accounted for 28% of the state's total energy consumption, while the industrial sector accounted for 27%.16 Most of Washington's more densely populated areas are west of the Cascade Range where the climate is moderated by the Pacific Ocean and summers are cool and winters are mild.17,18 The residential sector accounted for 26% of the state's energy consumption, and the commercial sector accounted for 19% of the state's total energy use.19 Overall, Washington consumes nearly twice as much energy as it produces, but its per capita energy consumption is less than in almost three-fourths of the states.20,21
Electricity
Washington’s Grand Coulee Dam is the seventh-largest hydroelectric power plant in the world.
In 2022, hydroelectric power accounted for 67% of Washington's total electricity net generation from both utility-scale (1 megawatt or larger) and small-scale (less than 1 megawatt) facilities.22 Washington typically contributes between one-fourth and one-third of all conventional hydroelectric generation in the nation annually, and 9 of the state's 10 largest power plants by capacity and 7 of the 10 by actual generation are hydroelectric facilities.23,24 Most of those hydroelectric plants are located on the Columbia River, and one of them, the Grand Coulee Dam, is the seventh-largest hydroelectric power plant by capacity in the world.25,26 Grand Coulee Dam's hydroelectric plant typically produces more than 21 million megawatthours of electricity each year and supplies power to 8 western states and parts of Canada.27 In part because of regional drought, Grand Coulee Dam produced about 17 million megawatthours of electricity in 2019, down from a high of more than 26 million megawatts in 2012. Grand Coulee Dam's contribution rose to more than 21 million megawatthours in 2022.28,29 The second-largest power plant in the state—Chief Joseph—is also a hydroelectric facility.30 Grand Coulee and Chief Joseph are among the eight Washington hydroelectric power plants that are owned and operated by the federal government.31 The Bonneville Power Administration, one of four federal power marketing administrations, distributes the electricity ¬produced at all federal dams in Washington.32,33
Natural gas, nonhydroelectric renewable resources (mostly wind), nuclear energy, and coal provide almost all the rest of Washington's in-state electricity generation. Natural gas is the second-largest in-state source of net generation, and it fueled 12% of the state's total electricity generation in 2022. Renewable resources other than hydroelectric power accounted for about 9% of state generation. Wind represented more than four-fifths of that share and biomass fueled almost all the rest, with solar energy supplying a small amount. Nuclear provided about 8% of total in-state generation, all¬¬¬¬¬¬ of it from the Columbia Generating Station, which is Washington's only operating nuclear power plant.34,35 It also is the only nonhydroelectric power plant among the state's 10 largest by capacity. In 2021, the Columbia nuclear plant was the state's fifth-largest power plant by capacity, but it was the state's third-largest provider of electricity.36 In 2022, coal fueled about 3% of the total electricity generated in Washington, almost all of it from one coal-fired power plant, the TransAlta Centralia plant.37 One of Centralia's two coal-fired units permanently shut down at the end of 2020, and the other is scheduled for retirement in 2025.38 Overall, Washington's electricity net generation exceeds electricity demand in the state, and the excess power generated is sent to the Western Interconnection, a regional grid that stretches from British Columbia and Alberta in Canada, to the northern part of Baja California, Mexico, and across all or parts of 14 western states.39,40
In 2022, Washington was among the six states in the nation with the lowest average electricity prices.41 The residential sector, where almost three in five households use electricity as their primary heating source, accounted for more than two-fifths of Washington's electricity sales in 2022.42 The commercial sector used almost one-third of the state's electricity, and the industrial sector accounted for almost one-fourth. The transportation sector also used a small amount of electricity for light rail and electric trolley buses.43,44 Washington is part of the West Coast Electric Highway, a network of public charging stations for electric vehicles located along Interstate 5 and other major roads in the Pacific Northwest. It is part of the larger West Coast Green Highway that extends from Canada to Mexico.45 More than 66,000 all-electric vehicles are registered in Washington, the fourth-most of any state.46 As of February 2023, the state had more than 1,600 public-access electric vehicle charging stations and about 4,100 charging ports.47
Renewable energy
In 2022, Washington produced one-tenth of the total renewable-sourced utility-scale electricity nationwide.
Washington leads the nation in electricity generation from hydroelectric power and accounted for about 31% of the nation's total hydroelectric generation in 2022.48 The state was second in the nation, after Texas, in utility-scale renewable generation from all sources. In 2022, Washington produced one-tenth of the nation's total renewable-sourced utility-scale electricity generation.49 Hydroelectric power accounted for almost nine-tenths of the state's total renewable power generation, and wind and biomass provided most of the rest.50 Some renewable energy resources are used in energy applications other than electricity generation, such as biofuel blends used for transportation and space heating as well as wood and solar energy used for space and water heating. About 3% of Washington's households heat with wood.51,52 When biofuels and thermal energy are included with renewable electricity generation, renewable resources account for about 90% of Washington's total energy production.53
Wind power is the second-largest contributor to the state's renewable electricity generation. It has supplied more than 6% of Washington's total electricity net generation in every year since 2013. In 2022, it supplied almost 8% of the state's power.54 Washington's first utility-scale wind project came online in 2001, and development of the state's wind resources, particularly along the Columbia Gorge, continues.55,56 As of December 2022, Washington had almost 3,400 megawatts of wind-powered capacity.57 The state's largest wind farm is along the Snake River in southeastern Washington. It came online in 2012 and has a capacity of about 343 megawatts.58
In 2022, biomass accounted for about 1% of Washington's total electricity net generation, about 3% of the nation's total net generation from biomass.59 Forests cover about half of Washington's land area, and wood and wood-derived fuels are the main sources of biomass used to fuel electricity generation in the state.60,61 Washington also has two wood pellet manufacturing plants with a combined production capacity of about 90,000 tons per year. Wood pellets are used for electricity generation and space heating.62
Solar energy supplies a small amount of Washington's total electricity generation. In 2022, almost all of it came from small-scale, customer-sited solar photovoltaic (PV) power installations, such as rooftop solar panels.63 One of the state's wind farms includes a 0.5-megawatt solar array, which came online in 2007, but Washington's first utility-scale solar PV project, a 19-megawatt facility, came online in 2018. A 150-megawatt solar project in Klickitat County came online in 2022 and is Washington's largest solar power plant so far. Other large solar projects are planned.64
Washington has several biogas and biofuel projects. There are several dairy farms in the state that use anaerobic digesters to generate electricity from methane captured from manure.65 Washington also has two biofuel manufacturing facilities. One plant can produce about 107 million gallons of biodiesel per year.66 The other facility, completed in late 2022, can produce about 110 million gallons of renewable diesel each year from waste vegetable oils and animal fats.67 In 2020, Washington consumers used about 22 million gallons of biodiesel.68 State law requires that at least 2% of all diesel fuel sold in Washington be biodiesel or renewable diesel. The law also requires that at least 20% of all diesel fuel used in state agency vehicles be biodiesel or renewable diesel.69 There are no commercial fuel ethanol producers in Washington.70 However, oxygenated motor gasoline blended with fuel ethanol is required statewide.71
Much of Washington has geothermal resources. Although the state does not generate electricity from geothermal energy, those resources are used to heat buildings, greenhouses, and water.72 Several of Washington's natural hot and mineral spring spas use their hot waters to provide space heating.73
Washington established a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in 2006 and revised it in 2019 when it enacted the Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA). The CETA requires electric utilities that serve retail customers to phase out coal-fired electricity from their energy mix by 2025. CETA also requires that utilities make their electricity supply greenhouse gas emissions neutral by 2030 and allows utilities to meet a portion of the requirement through offsets. By 2045, 100% of all electricity sold to in-state customers must come from renewable or non-emitting sources.74,75
Petroleum
Washington has the fifth-largest crude oil refining capacity in the nation.
Washington does not have any crude oil reserves or production.76 Even though oil exploration in the state began in 1900, drillers found only small amounts of crude oil, and the state has not produced any crude oil since the early 1960s.77 Nonetheless, Washington is a major oil refining center with the fifth-largest crude oil refining capacity in the nation.78 Washington's refineries receive crude oil supplies by pipeline, ship, and rail.79,80 The state's five refineries process domestic and foreign crude oils, primarily from Canada, North Dakota, and Alaska.81,82 Collectively, Washington's refineries can process about 650,000 barrels of crude oil per calendar day, which they process into a wide variety of products including transportation fuels. The largest refinery, Cherry Point in northwestern Washington, can process about 242,000 barrels of crude oil per calendar day.83 That refinery is also one of the few in the country that can produce renewable diesel from biomass-based feedstocks. In 2022, the plant expanded its renewable diesel production capacity to nearly 110 million gallons of renewable diesel per year.84,85
In 2020, Washington's total petroleum consumption was the 16th-highest in the nation, but its per capita consumption of petroleum ranked 37th among the states.86 The transportation sector accounted for 76% of the petroleum consumed in Washington.87 Motor gasoline, which all five of the state's refineries produce, accounts for more than two-fifths of Washington's total petroleum consumption, and distillate fuel oil (diesel) accounts for almost one-fourth. Washington is also the nation's 10th-largest jet fuel consumer and jet fuel accounts for about one-tenth of the state's petroleum consumption.88,89 The industrial sector is the second-largest petroleum consumer and accounted for 19% of state use.90 The commercial sector consumed 3%, and the residential sector, where about 1 in 20 households heat with petroleum products, used about 2%.91,92
Natural gas
Canada supplies most of the natural gas that Washington uses.
Washington has no natural gas reserves or production.93 However, the state has one underground natural gas storage field, the Jackson Prairie Gas Storage Facility located in western Washington. It has a total storage capacity of about 47 billion cubic feet.94,95,96 Canada supplies most of the natural gas that Washington uses. Almost two-thirds of the natural gas that enters the state comes from Idaho and most of that is originally from Canada. Another more than one-third enters Washington directly from Canada.97 Canada's Sumas Center, near the border between Washington and British Columbia, is a major natural gas trading and transportation hub.98 Nearly two-thirds of the natural gas that enters Washington continues south to Oregon.99
Washington consumes less natural gas than about half of the states, and uses less per capita than all but four other states and the District of Columbia.100 In 2019, the electric power sector accounted for the largest share of Washington's natural gas consumption for the first time. The electric power sector has remained the largest natural gas consumer in the state since then. In 2022, three-tenths of the natural gas delivered to consumers was used to generate electricity.101 The residential sector, where more than one-third of households rely on natural gas as their primary heating fuel, was the second-largest natural gas-consuming sector and accounted for more than one-fourth of the state total.102 The industrial sector accounted for about one-fourth of the natural gas consumed. The commercial sector consumed almost one-fifth, and the transportation sector used a small amount as compressed natural gas vehicle fuel.103
Coal
In 2021, Seattle was the fifth-largest coal export center in the United States.
Washington has nearly 700 million tons of estimated recoverable coal reserves, but there are no longer any active coal mines in the state.104 The last coal mine closed in 2006. That mine provided most of the coal used at the state's only coal-fired power plant near Centralia. Currently, coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana supplies the Centralia power plant, but the power plant's last coal-fired unit will retire by 2025.105 Industrial facilities in the state also receive small amounts of coal.106 Washington consumed about 2.2 million tons of coal in 2021, 38% less than in 2020.107 Coal from several western states is exported through Washington's Seattle Customs District. In 2021, Seattle was the fifth-largest coal export center in the nation, and accounted for about 8% of U.S. total coal exports.108
Energy on tribal lands
Washington is one of only eight states with more than 200,000 Native American residents, and Native Americans make up almost 3% of the state's population.109 There are 29 federally recognized tribes in Washington, and almost 6% of the state's land area is tribally held.110,111 Washington's tribal lands do not have fossil fuel resources, but they do have renewable resources.112
Many tribal lands in Washington have abundant biomass resources. The 12 tribes on the Colville Reservation and those on the Yakama Reservation—the two largest reservations in the state—have substantial forestry industries.113,114,115 Additionally, the Yakama reservation of southern Washington is among the top five reservations in the nation for potential electricity generation from biomass.116 The Quinault Indian Nation on Washington's Pacific coast has abundant woody biomass and uses sustainable forest practices. In addition to timber sales and cedar harvests, the tribe explored the feasibility of a wood pellet manufacturing facility on the reservation to manage forest slash, the woody debris from logging.117,118
In 2008, an agricultural cooperative, a salmon habitat restoration organization, and the Tulalip tribe joined together to form the Qualco electric cooperative. The cooperative generates electricity from methane produced in an anaerobic biodigester using manure and agricultural waste from local farms to reduce runoff that would otherwise enter and pollute nearby salmon streams.119,120 In 2022, Qualco Energy received funding from the state's Clean Energy Fund for participation in a hydrogen generation project using Qualco's renewable biogas. Clean burning hydrogen is a fuel that does not produce any CO2 emissions.121
Land that was once part of two Washington reservations—the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the Spokane Tribe Indian Reservation— is now the site of Grand Coulee Dam, the nation's largest hydroelectric power producer.122,123 Today, the Yakama reservation, the second-largest reservation in the state, has some of the best hydropower potential of any reservation in the nation and has more than 3 megawatts of hydroelectric capacity.124,125 The Yakama tribe is developing electric generation projects that will use solar and woody biomass resources and is exploring opportunities to develop its wind resources as well.126 Yakama Power, a tribal-owned utility, has worked toward acquisition of ownership interests in transmission and distribution facilities that serve the reservation.127
Several of Washington's tribal areas have solar and geothermal resources. The Spokane Nation of eastern Washington owns an energy company that constructed a 643-kilowatt community solar facility and has plans to build a 100-megawatt solar facility.128 In 2020, the Spokane Reservation received funding for 140 customer-sited solar PV installations from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).129 In 2021, the Lummi Nation received DOE funding to assist in the installation of a 100-kilowatt solar PV system in Bellingham, Washington.130 In 2022, a DOE grant to the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, whose lands are south of Seattle, will help pay for the installation of approximately 130 kilowatts of solar PV.131 Some tribal lands in eastern Washington also have geothermal resource potential.132

Hydro-Québec’s $6 Billion New York Line on Track for 2026 Start
April 20, 2023
Canadian power major Hydro-Québec expects to start exporting electricity from Québec to New York via the $6 billion underground and underwater Champlain Hudson Power Express by May 2026. It also hopes to restart work soon on another link to the US: the New England Clean Energy Connect.
These lines will enable the absorption of more renewables in the grid, Serge Abergel, chief operating officer of Hydro-Québec Energy Services, told BloombergNEF, underlining the critical role that hydropower has in the energy transition and the benefits of cross-border collaboration. Power could flow in the other direction from the US to Québec too, especially once planned offshore wind installations come online.
“You can see a future where Québec’s hydro-reservoirs with their storage capacity become a form of battery that provides support when there is not enough wind, or when there is too much wind,” said Abergel.
Hydro-Québec is Canada’s largest electricity producer, with over 37 gigawatts of installed capacity.
The company recently completed the acquisition of Great River Hydro, taking control of its 13 hydro stations totaling 589 megawatts in New England. “Our view is that these assets are going to have a great future…the natural course of events will make these assets valued in a way they are not currently,” Abergel said.
He expressed concern, however, about the time taken to receive approval for grid projects in the US. New transmission links are critical for energy transition. “The Biden administration has talked about tripling the grid, but if it takes 15 years to approve one link, some rethinking is required,” said Abergel.
Hydro-Québec is currently expanding its wind power portfolio. Last month, it invited bids for 1.5 gigawatts of wind power and it is in the process of finalizing contracts for another 1.3 gigawatts.
The following Q&A has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Q: The $6 billion Champlain Hudson Power Express will be operational by May 2026. What are the milestones between now and then?
A: Building CHPE [the Champlain Hudson Power Express] is no small challenge. There is over 300 miles of underwater-underground transmission lines all the way from the Québec border. There is a small section in Québec – roughly 35 miles – and then it runs to New York City. We had the ground-breaking ceremony in Whitehall with the Governor of New York [Kathy Hochul] in November.
This year – 2023 – is what we call a staging year, which involves preparing the route for cable laying and the construction of the zero-emissions converter station in Astoria, Queens, in New York City. On that site, our partner TDI [Blackstone-owned Transmission Developers] is dismantling six oil tanks that have been there since 1940 for fossil-fuel generation and remediating the area. Further, 2024 and 2025 will be construction and cable-laying years with power flowing in 2026.
Q: And what is the status of the other line under construction – the New England Clean Energy Connect?
A: A lot of work has been done on the NECEC [New England Clean Energy Connect] project. When the project was paused, our partner had already spent about $500 million toward building the NECEC. We hope to have a court decision on the project sometime this spring and restart construction to deliver the NECEC’s economic and climate benefits to folks in New England.
Both the projects are the same size and bring enough clean power from Québec to power a million homes each. We have 62 hydroelectric generating stations in Québec with over 37 gigawatts of installed capacity, and are bringing that clean power all the way to New England and New York City where electricity generation relies heavily on fossil fuels. The whole goal of this cross-border collaboration is to work together toward a clean energy future. Our neighbors are also ramping up their own sources of clean power with offshore wind, which is a really good fit with hydropower.
Q: We also keep hearing about the New England Clean Power Link. What is the status of that?
A: It is a proposal that has been put forward by our New York partner in the CHPE project – TDI, which is a Blackstone portfolio company. It is a viable solution, should, at some point in the future, there be a need for it. However, Québec’s long-term baseload energy commitments over new interties are reserved for the NECEC and CHPE projects.
Our strategic view is that interlinkages are extremely important to Canada and the US, and are the best way for us to work together toward the energy transition. The contracted flow of baseload energy is 10.4 terawatt-hours toward New York City (20% of the City’s needs). As the transition evolves in these regions, and as New York builds its renewables portfolio, there will be a need for two-way trade. These power lines are conceived to be bidirectional. You can see a future where Québec’s hydro reservoirs with their storage capacity become a form of battery that provides support when there is not enough wind, or when there is too much wind. The ambition is to store this excess power in our reservoir for future use in the northeast region, instead of wasting it.
Q: Does the Inflation Reduction Act change anything for you? Are there new incentives that can be tapped?
A:  From a Canadian perspective, no. From our partners’ perspective, I understand they are trying to analyze different options and see if there is anything that can be done with the IRA provisions.
Q: In addition to being the supplier of power, is Hydro-Québec a co-developer of the transmission link too? 
A: We are primarily the supplier of clean power. We are also the developer for the Québec portion of the line (35 miles) and the Hertel converter station. On the US side, TDI is building the link and converter station in Queens.
Q: What is the tariff that has been decided for the power that you send across and how does it escalate? Does inflation impact the cost of the project? 
A: Our contract with NYSERDA [the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority] is for the sale and purchase of renewable energy credits associated with energy delivered into New York City (under the Tier 4 program). That uses a structure that provides 25 years of predictable pricing for RECs.
Even with the current exceptional inflationary pressures, we feel that we are good in terms of the cost of the project. The large quantity of renewable energy from CHPE will reduce electricity price volatility driven by sharp changes in fossil-fuel prices, such as the 28% jump from December 2021 to January 2022.
Q: How do you view hydro’s role in the energy transition? 
A: This transition is not about ideology. You cannot transition an economy – especially not an economy of the size of New York’s or Québec’s – without having available on-demand power, or baseload power. You can have as much intermittent resources as you want, but these will not do the job at the times when you don’t have wind or sun. There is battery storage, but it is short duration – a few hours. If you have a wind gap for a week, you have a problem. You will be relying on fossil fuels, and not meeting your emissions-reduction goals, your climate goals. So, pragmatically, hydropower absolutely has a role to play. There are not many sources of clean baseload power available.
We go back to the science and look at the greenhouse gas emissions from different power generation options. When you compare the different sources over a 100-year lifespan – you look at GHG emissions from wind, you look at solar, look at hydro and fossil-fuel power sources – hydro is on par with wind. A hydroelectric generating station, if maintained, can live forever. In Québec, we have some that are over 100 years old.
If you are going to heat your house with electricity, like we do in Québec, you need something that is available on demand – sources that are 100% reliable when you need them. There are not many sources.
Q: Does Hydro-Québec plan to grow its own portfolio by building new plants or acquiring built-up assets?
A: The last generating station that we finished building recently is Romaine-4. It takes 15-20 years to plan and build a large hydroelectric project. It is a long-term investment. Our strategic plan and our vision for the next 10 years focuses on three elements.
Firstly, we are bringing much more wind power online. Multiple gigawatts. We are involved in some of the projects directly, or we are procuring through private companies that sell to us.
The second element is adding capacity to our existing hydropower generating stations by 2035. We have ongoing refurbishments which will yield about 2,000 megawatts of additional power through optimization using the latest digital tools, so every replaced generating unit ends up giving 5-10% additional power, squeezing more out from the same resources.
The third element is energy efficiency. Hydro-Québec has 4.5 million customers and almost 90% of them heat their facilities or homes with electricity in winter. Through automation, smart meters and interconnected devices, you can reduce peak power demand, create efficiencies and save energy. Our outlook for 2030 is about 10 terawatt-hours of saved energy.
There are no new hydro plants planned for now in Québec. But there will come a time when the Northeast region will face an intermittency problem and there will be a need for more clean baseload sources of power. This conversation is unavoidable at some point.
Q: I was once told that baseload as a concept will be retired in a smart, modern power system. Do you agree?
A: Baseload power is not a trendy cool concept to talk about when we talk about the transition. However, the intermittency issue is real. There are only two ways to balance out intermittent sources for an extended period of time at the moment – burning gas, coal or oil. But those unfortunately pollute. The other is hydro and nuclear which are clean.
Q: Hydro-Québec just completed the acquisition of Great River Hydro in New England. Are you open to more acquisitions?
A: Yes, we are open to further acquisitions. What you have seen with Great River Hydro is really us looking to invest further in our specific area of expertise, which is hydropower. Most of the 13 generating stations have a head reservoir. It is very similar to what we have in Québec, though on a smaller scale.
When you look at a grid that is entirely decarbonized – meaning you won’t be able to burn something to get electricity or you will have to compensate somehow – hydropower will become critical. Our view is that these assets are going to have a great future because they are in regions that have aggressive climate goals, and the natural course of events will make these assets valued in a way they are not currently.
Q: What is the biggest task before you as Hydro-Québec’s lead in the US?
A: Completing these projects – NECEC and CHPE – is the top priority for our US presence, obviously. We realize that there is a need for a greater understanding of our role. We are engaging in advocacy, and contributing to the conversation. Our goal is to have a strong US presence and to be a long-term partner.
Q: What do you say to those who argue that instead of exporting clean power, you should use that power to make something and then export it after some value-addition?
A: There are folks in Québec that want to keep all the power locally and use it to attract businesses. I think we can do both. This is a question that comes to many economies as they transition, because the value of green power is very high. There is going to be a lot of thinking about this. Being a partner to our neighbors for this transition is a very important part of our philosophy.
Q: The leadership at Hydro-Québec is changing. Could that lead to a change in strategy and philosophy? 
A: Hydro-Québec is a large organization with over 22,000 employees. We have changed CEOs before. Certain fundamental aspects will remain the same. Clean energy exports to the US and the pollution they allow to avoid is something we are proud of.
When we look around at the transmission throughout the US, it is a challenging business. There aren’t many projects moving forward. CHPE is a success, but it took 15 years to get all the approvals. It should not take this long. It is also a wake-up call. Maybe we ought to change the way we do things, because a lot more of these will need to be built. The Biden administration has talked about tripling the grid, but if it takes 15 years to approve one link, some rethinking is required. There are bigger challenges ahead. People will have to understand and get used to the fact that to transition, you will need new transmission infrastructure. The energy transition is costly, but not transitioning is going to be even more expensive.

One of my favorite questions to ask is: What is your favorite body of water? The answer to this question connects people to waterbodies that inspire us. Mine, is the Pacific Ocean.
I have spent endless hours with my children exploring the Pacific coast. This connection is why I do what I do to protect water for future generations.
Your turn. What is your favorite body of water? Is it a lake where you learned to swim? A stream where you turned over rocks to find critters as a kid? A river where you go fishing? Now, imagine if that waterbody was threatened by pollution that could be prevented using technologies that are available and affordable today. That’s where EPA and the Clean Water Act come in.
Understanding the Issue
Click to enlarge the diagram.
Steam electric power plants use heat to create steam that turns a turbine and produces electricity. Coal is one fuel that can be used to create heat, others include natural gas, oil, and nuclear fuel. Steam-electric power plants use a lot of water. In 2015, these facilities withdrew 133 billion gallons of water per day—primarily from our rivers, lakes, and estuaries. Coal-fired power plants use water for cooling, generating steam, and for industrial processes like scrubbing air pollutants and transporting coal ash. The industrial process wastewater that is returned to the environment can contain toxic metals and other pollutants that contaminate our vital water sources. Not only does this threaten fish and wildlife, but it can also contribute to serious health risks for people—like cancer in adults and lowered IQs in children. Some of these pollutants, once they are discharged into the environment, can remain there for years.
Making Strides
At EPA, it’s our privilege and responsibility to implement the Clean Water Act, which was passed by Congress 50 years ago with a bold vision that our waters be fishable and swimmable. Under this authority, we follow the science, including innovations in pollution control technology that can get us closer to the clean water future Congress called for.
EPA is committed to following the science and we are proud to propose the strongest limits ever on wastewater discharges from coal fired power plants, using decisions rooted in science.
This is why we proposed to strengthen wastewater discharge standards that apply to coal-fired power plants. EPA’s proposal applies the agency’s longstanding authority under the Clean Water Act to establish discharge standards that reflect the ability of more advanced treatment technologies to remove pollutants.
The Clean Water Act also gives the Environmental Protection Agency flexibility to create workable compliance options for coal-fired power plants that have already invested in water pollution controls or may stop burning coal in the coming years. These flexibilities are also a key feature of EPA’s proposal.
It’s All About Impact
This action will accelerate progress toward less polluting electricity generation that fosters clean water, clean air, healthy lands, and resilient communities. We estimate that the proposed regulation would reduce pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired power plants by approximately 584 million pounds per year.
This action will make the biggest difference in environmental justice communities that so often live, learn, work, and play just downstream from coal-fired power plants. We have known for years that disadvantaged communities are disproportionately hurt by pollution from power plants, and it is no surprise that water quality protections from our proposal would help close this water equity gap.
Our Promise
EPA is consistently working to ensure that all people have clean and safe water while providing regulatory certainty and supporting economic opportunity. Our proposal is one way we are delivering on that promise.
We are also committed to moving forward with transparency and collaboration. As we further develop rules pertaining to our power sector, we are committed to moving forward in a transparent and orderly way to provide industry, states, grid operators, and other stakeholders with regulatory certainty and a clear, long-term planning horizon to support their decision-making.
We are currently requesting public comment on this proposed rule and want to hear from you! You can submit comments in writing (by May 30 2023) and/or tell us your views at one of our public hearings on April 20 and 25, 2023.
This proposed rule would not have been possible without our professional EPA staff. I want to thank them for their tireless dedication to the agency’s mission. They help secure a brighter, cleaner, and healthier future for all.

Willamette Valley Projects
West Coast
The Willamette Valley Flood Control Project consists of 13 dams in Oregon, operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Most of these dams are ""high head"" dams that are over 250 feet tall. The primary purpose of the dams is to provide critical flood damage reduction for the entire Willamette Valley, including the cities of Eugene, Salem, and Portland. The dams also provide some hydroelectric generation (about 180 megawatts annually), along with recreational and fishing opportunities, water quality benefits, and municipal and irrigation water. The Willamette Project also includes maintenance of 42 miles of bank protection projects and operation of a hatchery mitigation program.
The Willamette Project has adversely affected Upper Willamette River Chinook salmon and steelhead by blocking access to a large amount of their historical habitat upstream of the dams and contributing to degradation of their remaining downstream habitat. The associated mitigation hatcheries that accompanied the dam building had an effect on the genetic diversity of Chinook salmon populations in the Willamette Basin. Other factors in the decline of Willamette salmon and steelhead include habitat degradation by other activities, hatchery effects, and harvest.
Reducing the adverse effects of the Willamette Project is one component of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) recovery plan for Upper Willamette River Chinook salmon and steelhead. NOAA Fisheries consulted with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bonneville Power Administration, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (collectively, the Action Agencies) to evaluate the effects of the Willamette Project on these ESA-listed species, resulting in our Willamette River Biological Opinion.
In the Biological Opinion’s Reasonable and Prudent Alternative, NOAA Fisheries identified measures and timelines for completion that the Action Agencies must implement to reduce the Willamette Project’s effects. These measures include providing fish passage at three dams, temperature improvements downstream of another dam, improvements in downstream flows, screening of irrigation diversions, improving hatchery practices and facilities, and habitat improvement projects. In addition, the Action Agencies will carry out a series of research, monitoring, and evaluation measures to develop appropriate actions and evaluate their effectiveness.
A new entity called the Willamette Action Team for Ecosystem Restoration (WATER) fosters an ecosystem-wide perspective and cooperation among all concerned parties, including states and tribes. Five teams address implementation and adaptive management.
The Willamette Biological Opinion is not a long-term salmon recovery plan, but efforts to make the dams more fish-friendly, to improve river water temperatures, and to improve hatchery practices will measurably aid long-term recovery efforts. Please see the Upper Willamette River Recovery Plan to learn more about recovery for Chinook salmon and steelhead in the river.
Upper Willamette Hatchery Program
In the Willamette Basin, there are four hatchery Chinook salmon programs, one hatchery summer steelhead program, and one rainbow trout program. All of these programs are funded by the Bonneville Power Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), and are operated by ODFW using seven hatchery facilities in the Upper Willamette.
The primary purpose of these hatchery programs is to mitigate for fishery losses associated with the construction and continued operation of the 13 federal dams in the Willamette Basin. Hatchery fish provide important societal benefits in ocean and freshwater fisheries.
The Willamette Biological Opinion’s Reasonable and Prudent Alternative states two primary goals for these hatchery programs:
Ensure the hatchery programs are not reducing the viability of natural-origin spring-run Chinook salmon and winter-run steelhead in the Upper Willamette populations.
Appropriately manage hatchery Chinook salmon on the spawning grounds to conserve and rebuild runs of natural-origin spring-run Chinook salmon above and below the federal dams.
Willamette Chinook
In the Willamette Valley basin, there are four hatchery Chinook salmon programs:
North Santiam Chinook
Chinook salmon in North Santiam River spawn, rear, and are released at the Marion Forks hatchery and Minto collection facility. Key actions in the Willamette Biological Opinion include:
using the hatchery program to reintroduce Chinook salmon back into historical habitat above Big Cliff and Detroit dams; and
(b) evaluating different growth rates in the hatchery to make hatchery smolts similar to their wild counterparts.
South Santiam Chinook
Key actions in the Willamette Biological Opinion for the South Santiam hatchery at Foster Dam include using the hatchery program to reintroduce Chinook salmon back into historical habitat above Foster and Green Peter dams, preserving genetic resources of the historical population, and discontinuing the release of this stock into the Molalla River (developing a local stock).
For McKenzie Chinook salmon at the McKenzie hatchery, key actions in the Willamette Biological Opinion include reducing the spawning of hatchery Chinook salmon in the wild and reintroducing Chinook salmon above Cougar Dam.
For Middle Fork Willamette Chinook at the Willamette hatchery and Dexter collection facility, key actions in the Willamette Biological Opinion include using the hatchery program to reintroduce Chinook salmon back into historical habitat above Dexter, Lookout Point, and Hills Creek Dams.
For more information on these programs, visit the ODFW Hatcheries web page and our Upper Willamette Hatchery Programs page.
Habitat Measures - Restoration
Operation of the Willamette Project impacts habitat that is important for healthy salmon and steelhead populations. It degrades rearing, holding, and spawning habitat below the dams, reducing the abundance and productivity of ESA-listed Upper Willamette Chinook salmon and Upper Willamette steelhead. Lack of upstream and downstream fish passage at the Willamette Project dams also prevent safe access to historical breeding and rearing habitat, restricting most of these fish to habitat below the dams.
A key habitat strategy of the Willamette Biological Opinion is to work with other partners in the basin to assess needs and identify and prioritize restoration projects. In addition, the Action Agencies will plan and carry out habitat restoration programs on off-site lands to protect and restore aquatic habitat to address limiting factors for ESA-listed fish.
The Habitat Technical Team reviews potential habitat protection and restoration projects for funding using the process approved by the Independent Scientific Review Panel. In 2010, The Bonneville Power Administration provided essential funds for three of these habitat protection projects and funded one restoration project. From 2011-2013, the Bonneville Power Administration provided $500,000 annually for habitat restoration and protection projects, and has since increased their funding to $800,000 annually through 2023 for these projects.

Amy Williams of Skellig contrasts Industry 4.0 and 3.0 principles in a theoretical greenfield Life Sciences plant. Her Unified Namespace demo uses Ignition and she says, ""Ten years ago when you heard of ignition you might have thought oh that's a SCADA system. That is not an accurate description of what it is today. It really has evolved into being an industrial platform you can use to solve so many use cases.""

Electricity Cooperative Pflersch

Small hydropower plants have long sustained remote communities in the Alps – but there is a growing debate over their environmental impact.
The Furtalm, an idyllic mountain farm in South Tyrol in the northern Italian Alps, is surrounded by waterfalls. Their rushing sound fills the air, along with the bells from a small herd of grazing cows. Hikers sit at long tables outside a tiny farm kitchen, enjoying hearty meals of homemade cheese dumplings and apple strudel. Having arrived after a bracing hike, I order a plate of dumplings, and enjoy the view over a nearby stream. Apart from looking very charming, the stream is doing me a practical favour: it is helping provide my lunch.
A tiny hydropower plant, tucked away out of sight, generates the electricity for the entire farm: enough to run the milking machine by the stable, the fridge in the dairy where the cheese is made, and all the kitchen appliances used to make my dumplings.
""Electricity is free here, it's always been that way. When it's right next to your door, you don't have an electricity counter,"" says Alexandra Larch, who runs the farm and restaurant with her family in the summer months, and spends the winters in the valley. Her parents have an even smaller hydro plant next to their own mountain farm: it's so tiny they have to switch off everything else in the house before they switch on the milking machine. As I enjoy my delicious dumplings, I can hear a faint clanging sound in the distance. It comes from a construction site for another hydro plant, built by a local cooperative.
South Tyrol and its Alpine neighbours are known as Europe's hydro powerhouses, mainly thanks to their large plants, which mark parts of the landscape with their valley-spanning reservoirs and giant pipes. Hydropower generates more than 7,300 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year in South Tyrol, some 90% of its total electricity production, enough to export about half of it to other Italian regions in the summer months. Over 80% of that hydropower output is generated by only 30 big plants. But in recent years, another aspect of the Alpine energy supply has been gaining increasing attention: hundreds of small hydropower plants, many rooted in traditional cultures of self-sufficiency and self-determination.

There are about 1,000 hydropower plants in South Tyrol, and the vast majority of them are small or medium-sized – ranging from tiny ones powering a single farm, to clusters of more sizeable ones covering an entire valley's supply. Most are run-of-river diversion plants, meaning a part of the stream is diverted, typically by small dams or weirs, through a pipe to a turbine. (There is no standard global definition of small hydro, and the upper limit can vary hugely between countries, but international reports tend to define it as up to 10 megawatt installed capacity. In South Tyrol, small typically means up to 220 kilowatt (kW) capacity, and medium, up to 3 megawatts [MW]). Elsewhere in the Alps, the picture is similar, with a multitude of small or mid-sized plants allowing individual farms or villages to be self-sufficient, while typically making a modest contribution of only around 10% or so to national hydropower production.
Advocates of small hydro present it as a relatively low-impact source of energy, with scope for global expansion. As rocketing energy prices and fears of blackouts, along with climate change, accelerate the quest to find alternatives to coal, gas and oil, the idea of a robust, renewable local energy source may sound very appealing. But critics argue that the ecological cost of small plants may be higher than previously thought – and needs to be carefully balanced against their benefits.

A few months after my summer hike, in November, I call the Pflersch energy cooperative, which is behind the new power plant being built near the Furtalm, in the beautiful Pflersch Valley. The managing director of the cooperative, Franz Schwitzer, chuckles as he tells me that he is getting a lot of media requests these days: with the world gripped by an energy crisis, his resilient cooperative is attracting attention.
In Brief: How sustainable is small hydropower?
Historically, small hydropower helped bring electricity to many remote communities such as farms and villages in the Alps. As a legacy of this decentralised energy landscape, there are still thousands of medium-sized, small and even tiny hydropower plants in the Alps, some powering entire valleys, others, a single farm, or even, a single milking machine. New ones have also been built, based on the assumption that their environmental impact is relatively low.
However, criticism of small hydropower has been growing. There is mounting scientific evidence that their impact is larger than was previously thought, and that they can disrupt streams, damage habitats and harm migratory fish.
Although small hydropower has faced criticism, those opposing it don't necessarily rule it out altogether. Rather, a common view is that the ecological impact and social and economic benefits have to be assessed carefully, case by case.
The cooperative owns four small-to-medium-sized hydro plants in the valley, the biggest of which has an installed capacity of about 3 megawatts, as well as the one under construction. Its roughly 300 members, such as farmers, villagers, small companies and small hotels, pay only 3.1 euro cents (3.2 US cents/2.7p) per kilowatt/hour (10 euro cents/10 US cents/8.7p including taxes), up to a consumption of 1,250kWh per month. (At the time of reporting, the market price in Italy was 66 euro cents (69 US cents/57p) per kWh for the typical household, including taxes). The cooperative also supplies non-members at the market price, such as big hotels and a ski lift. For most of the year, the hydro power it generates is enough to make the Pflersch Valley self-sufficient.
""If the Italian grid were to collapse, it wouldn't be a problem for us during nine months of the year – spring, summer and autumn – given normal weather. We'd just switch our network to 'isolated operation' [for self-consumption],"" says Schwitzer. In winter, the cooperative purchases additional energy from the market. If it could store the energy from the warmer months, it would be self-sufficient all year round. The community-centred model is not unusual in the region, where small firms and cooperatives are seen as adding diversity and resilience to the energy sector. According to Thomas Senoner, the director of South Tyrol's public agency for the sustainable use of water resources, part of the region's energy policy is to support rural life in the mountains, including traditional cooperatives.
To people whose lives are currently blighted by soaring energy prices, such self-sufficiency may seem like the ultimate luxury. But as Schwitzer points out, South Tyrol's cooperatives were a result of necessity, and extreme marginalisation.
The traditionally German-speaking region came under Italian rule in the early 20th Century. Some local families still harbour heartbreaking memories of the time when the central Italian government built big hydropower plants in their pristine valleys, flooding historical villages and centuries-old farms, to provide energy for Italian factories, not remote Alpine communities. Today, South Tyrol is still part of Italy but an autonomous province with control of its own energy resources.
""The cooperatives were originally created because of a disadvantage, because we were in the periphery. In the 1950s, we would never have received electricity from the main grid,"" says Schwitzer. ""So the people said to themselves, fine, we'll do it ourselves, we'll build our own power plant. They were brave pioneers who used their private funds as collateral to take out credit and pay for the turbines. And that disadvantage of the past, has now turned into an advantage.""
His cooperative has an especially long history: the local priest and three farmers started its first hydro plant in a hamlet called Boden almost 100 years ago.

Today, tighter environmental regulation is making any further construction beyond the cooperative's fifth plant unlikely, says Schwitzer. He sees wind and solar power as possible options for the future of his valley, but for now, both face constraints. Wind farms have faced resistance from Alpine hiking associations. Solar panels can only be installed on roofs in South Tyrol, not as solar farms on the ground. Renovating and optimising existing hydro plants, especially the big ones, is an important step, he says. Nevertheless, in his view, small hydro shouldn't only be judged on efficiency, but also on its social role enhancing life in the mountains.
""There's a broad consensus here: the water used to generate this energy comes from our valley, and that's why we want to keep the value it creates. It's always been that way here, we organise ourselves, we're not that dependent on outside help."" He compares it to the long tradition of mutual aid in bad weather and emergencies, and the tight network of volunteer-run associations, from the local orchestra to the fire brigade.
Proponents of small hydro argue that it could boost the wellbeing of many other communities around the world, too. The World Small Hydropower Development Report by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization promotes small hydropower as a ""renewable and rural energy source for sustainable development"". The report suggests that small hydropower could help provide power to the estimated one billion people worldwide who still do not have access to electricity.
Critics of small hydro power do tend to make an exception for remote, isolated communities. But they also emphasise that it should be used as a last resort. Cipra, an Alps-wide organisation promoting sustainable development in the area, for example recommends using small hydro plants ""for limited and isolated local needs only"". Using them for energy production beyond these remote areas would require such a large number of plants ""that the cumulative environmental impact would be ecologically unbearable"".
After all, the existing multitude of small hydro plants contributes little to the overall energy output, even in places where such plants have a long history. In Switzerland, more than 1,400 tiny, small and medium-sized hydropower plants of up to 10 MW capacity, together produce about 10% of the country's total hydropower output. In Bavaria, in Germany's mountainous south, 94% of the region's over 4,000 hydro plants have a capacity of under 1 MW, covering only about 9% of total hydropower output. In Austria, 95% of grid-connected hydro plants have a capacity of less than 10 MW, and generate about 14% of total hydropower output. There are another 2,000 or so off-grid plants in Austria, supplying private households.

Globally, that imbalance between the number of small plants and their overall output is similar. Small plants represent an estimated 91% of all hydropower installations, but only make up 11% of hydropower output. And yet, they have seen a worldwide boom in recent years – as well as a growing body of evidence from around the world suggesting their impact is more profound than was previously thought.
""The biggest problem associated with small hydropower concerns their sheer numbers,"" says Thiago Couto, an aquatic ecologist and postdoctoral associate at the University of Miami. He has studied the effects of small hydropower plants around the world, including in countries such as Brazil. ""Today, for every large hydropower dam operating there are other 11 'small' ones, and their numbers are expected to continue rising into the future. The cumulative impact of all these small dams on hydrology, fish migration and water quality is an issue of high concern, especially in rivers that accommodate multiple dams.""
Small hydropower dams may for example play a disproportionate role in interrupting the natural flow of rivers, known as river fragmentation, research by Couto and others shows. This can prevent migratory fish from travelling. Environmental activists have described the impact of such an accumulation of small, disruptive plants on rivers as ""death by a thousand cuts"".
From an environmental perspective, ""small"" is not a particularly meaningful term, Couto notes, since it usually just refers to generation capacity – rather than to factors that actually matter for the plant's ecological impact, such as how much water is diverted, and how much remains in the stream bed. And while small hydropower is often marketed as a good solution for unconnected communities, globally, ""the proliferation of small hydropower is not being primarily propelled by rural electrification,"" he says, but rather, by incentives and subsidies that make it a lucrative investment for businesses.
Nor are remote communities necessarily in favour of small hydropower. Sámi reindeer herders in northern Norway have opposed small hydropower development in the past, out of concern over its impact on reindeer pastures.
Scientists have also pointed to the knowledge gap around small hydro, since they are only beginning to fully understand how different factors affect a plant's overall impact.
A team of scientists conducting a long-term ecological research project in the Matschertal valley (Val di Mazia), led by the Institute for Alpine Environment at the Eurac Research Center in South Tyrol, made a surprising discovery. Their project's main aim has been to study the impact of climate change on an Alpine river ecosystem. But a few years into the study, a small run-of-river diversion hydropower plant with a weir was added to the steep, glacier-fed, fast-flowing stream they were monitoring. They used the opportunity to make a before-and-after comparison of the plant's impact on benthic macroinvertebrates – small aquatic animals such as stonefly larvae that live in waterbodies, and are commonly used as indicators of their ecological condition. They expected the plant to have a significant impact on the macroinvertebrates – but those expectations were not confirmed.
Instead, the results of the five-year study showed ""no significant variation in the benthic macroinvertebrate communities stemming from the activity of the hydropower plant"". A second study looking specifically at the functional traits of the macroinvertebrates before and after the plant's installation – meaning, how they interacted with their environment and with other species – and did not find any significant differences, either.
""One really important point is that there are no fish in this particular part of the river,"" says Roberta Bottarin, a limnologist and the vice head of the Institute for Alpine Environment at Eurac, who co-authored the study. ""If there had been fish, we would probably have had very different results."" In her view, other factors, including the relatively large amount of water left in the original stream, may also have helped buffer the impact of the plant.
Still, she cautions against interpreting the results as a green light for small hydropower in the high mountains, emphasising that the team only measured the impact on the macroinvertebrates, not on the wider ecosystem. ""From an ecological point of view, these high mountain streams are very sensitive. And if you build a plant there, you risk disrupting that ecological continuity and disturbing the natural balance. It's really something you have to weigh very carefully.""
Sophie Hardach
In the Pflersch Valley, there are four small hydropower plants and a fifth – probably the area's last – under construction (Credit: Sophie Hardach)
That tricky balance should, however, also take into account the energy needs of mountain communities, in her opinion: ""Sustainable doesn't only mean ecological, it also includes social and economic factors. That's really important, and has to be considered,"" she says. ""When there's no other option, you have to accept a compromise, and try and make it as ecologically acceptable as possible, for example by ensuring that enough water remains in the stream.""
Carbon Count
The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2, given Sophie was already in South Tyrol for reasons other than this reporting assignment. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.
Asked whether one should consider social and economic factors when assessing the impact of small hydropower, such as the needs of remote communities in the Alps, Christine Weber, a river ecologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), says: ""That is a difficult question. I tend to say that a case-by-case assessment is needed where the bigger picture is looked at,"" meaning, the ecological impact on the whole river basin.
A 2018 review by Weber and others analysed evidence on this basin-scale impact, which can include sediment clogging the stream bed, a poorer habitat for fish, and a negative effect on fish populations. According to the review, the small hydropower boom is ""exacerbating ongoing habitat fragmentation and degradation, and further fuelling biodiversity loss"".
Others have voiced similar warnings. Environmental organisations, for example in Austria, have raised concerns. German scientists have spoken out against small hydro plants in an open letter, describing them as a ""renewable but not necessarily environmentally friendly"" source of energy.
Looking back at my delightful Alpine dumpling lunch, powered by mini hydro, I reflect on my own role in this energy dilemma. Tourism is an important part of the South Tyrolean economy, and provides communities with a local source of income – but there is no doubt that I and my fellow tourists are also putting additional pressure on local energy sources. And saving energy is probably easier for a tourist with no chores and plenty of leisure time, than a farmer with cows to milk and cheese to refrigerate. I resolve to make any future Alpine holidays as energy-saving as possible. Keeping my footprint modest is, perhaps, a small contribution I can make to help the people of the Alps preserve their lovely part of the world for future generations.

Are you wondering how?

Hydroelectric power facilities emit no pollutants into the atmosphere. They often replace the production of fossil fuels, which lowers smog and acid rain. Furthermore, hydroelectric developments produce no hazardous waste.

In 2028, hydropower will remain the largest renewable electricity source
Renewable energy expansion in 2023 was heavily concentrated in just ten countries, responsible for 80% of global annual additions. To achieve a tripling of global renewable capacity, a much faster deployment rate is necessary in numerous other nations. Moreover, many emerging and developing economies rely primarily on hydropower.

Reaching the tripling of renewables by 2030 would necessitate the commissioning of almost 3 000 GW of new renewable capacity in 2029 and 2030. For hydropower and other renewables, annual additions need to triple compared with 2027 and 2028.

Tracking Hydroelectricity
More efforts needed
Hydroelectricity generation increased by almost 70 TWh (up close to 2%) in 2022, reaching 4 300 TWh. Hydropower remains the largest renewable source of electricity, generating more than all other renewable technologies combined. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, hydropower maintains an average annual generation growth rate of close to 4% in 2023-2030 to provide approximately 5 500 TWh of electricity per year. In the last five years the average growth rate was less than one-third of what is required, signalling a need for significantly stronger efforts, especially to streamline permitting and ensure project sustainability. Hydropower plants should be recognised as a reliable backbone of the clean power systems of the future and supported accordingly.

Opinion: Energy importers must consider true ‘sustainability’ of Laos hydropower
Proponents describe regional power grids as a way to promote economic growth, energy security and renewables in Southeast Asia, but this might come at a heavy cost

Ming Li Yong
August 23, 2022
On 23 June 2022, the import of 100 megawatts (MW) of hydropower from Laos to Singapore through Thailand and Malaysia was hailed as a historic milestone. Part of a pilot project known as the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP), this event represented Singapore’s first ever import of renewable energy, and also the first instance of cross-border electricity trade involving four countries from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
However, this development takes place amid rising concerns for the ecological future of the transboundary Mekong River and the millions of people who depend on it. A 2018 study by the Mekong River Commission concluded that further hydropower development on the river would negatively affect ecosystems, and would reduce soil fertility, rice production, fish yields and food security, while increasing poverty in the river basin.
The draw of hydropower and a regional power grid
For landlocked Laos, the recent export of energy to Singapore brings it one step closer to fulfilling its ambition to become the “battery of Southeast Asia” by harnessing the 23,000 MW of exploitable hydropower potential from the Mekong and its tributaries. Currently, Laos has more than 70 operational dams with a total generating capacity of 8,880 MW, of which two are on the Mekong’s mainstream. Seven more are in various stages of planning on the mainstream. According to Stimson’s Mekong Infrastructure Tracker, around 30 dams are under construction across Laos, and over 200 are planned.
How is hydropower exported?
Hydropower is a lucrative pillar of the Laotian government’s goal to lift the country out of its status as one of the world’s least developed countries. A 2010 assessment by the International Centre for Environmental Management found that if all proposed dams on the main Mekong River were to go ahead, Laos would earn up to USD 2.6 billion per year in export revenue.
In theory, establishing regional power grids connecting Mekong and ASEAN countries would enable power trading between countries such as Laos, which produces surplus energy, and energy-hungry countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. By 2021, out of Laos’ 10,400 MW total installed energy capacity, of which 80% is generated by hydropower dams, 5,421 MW was exported to Thailand and 572 MW was sold to Vietnam. Proponents describe regional grids as a way to promote economic growth, energy security and the development of renewable energy in Southeast Asia.
RECOMMENDED
What are the impacts of dams on the Mekong river?
Yet, this might be taking place at the expense of the environment, natural resource-based livelihoods and food security. A 2018 study by Mae Fah Luang University in Thailand and the Australian National University estimated that the total external costs of the 11 planned mainstream dams on the lower Mekong would total USD 18 billion, and that the projects were not economically viable when weighed against the loss of capture fisheries, sediment, and social mitigation costs.
Large-scale dams as drivers of environmental injustice
The production of renewable energy, be it wind, solar or hydropower, requires the construction of infrastructure that incurs different degrees of impact on the environment.
Large hydropower dams are controversial in terms of their destructive effects on river systems, even more so in watersheds that span multiple countries and in the context of climate change. For more than a decade, communities who live on riverbanks in northern Thailand have reported fluctuating water levels they claim are caused by upstream dam operations on China’s section of the Mekong, which they say have influenced their dry-season livelihoods negatively. 
Dams also block the supply of sediments that form fertile floodplains. A few weeks after the Xayaburi Dam in northern Laos became operational in October 2019, the usually-muddy Mekong turned clear blue, indicating that the river had become starved of nutrient-rich sediment.

In addition, Mekong hydropower dams block fish migration routes, threatening food security in one of the world’s largest inland fisheries. Fisheries account for up to 30% of Cambodia and Laos’ national protein supply, and fishers are overrepresented in poor and vulnerable communities in the lower Mekong basin. 
These issues contribute to concern that the construction of large dams in the Mekong region is a significant driver of environmental injustice. Despite claims by the Laotian government that hydropower dams are built in line with safeguards to mitigate their impact, a wide range of academic studies have demonstrated otherwise. The cases of the Nam Theun 2 project, which was supported by the World Bank and touted as a ‘model’ for dam-building in Laos, the Theun-Hinboun dam, and the collapse of the Xe Pian-Xe Namnoy dam in 2018 have demonstrated that the Laos government’s weak capacity in regulating hydropower dam construction has contributed to the creation of vulnerability among affected communities.
Dam construction along the Mekong and its tributaries takes place amid weak social and environmental safeguards; poor-quality environmental impact assessments that fail to fully account for the transnational and cumulative effects of hydropower development; and a lack of meaningful public participation in decision-making. Meanwhile, few avenues are available for affected communities to seek compensation for losses in livelihoods.
Sustainability beyond borders
By supporting the hydropower industry in Laos, Singapore’s energy import will inflict environmental harm and injustice on the Mekong’s ecosystems and the millions of people who depend on the river for their livelihoods and food security. But it is also in Singapore’s national interests to consider transboundary environmental sustainability.
RECOMMENDED
Wet-season dam operations hit Mekong ecology and communities
Firstly, the long-term sustainability of hydropower dams on the Mekong is doubtful, given the uncertainties of climate change that may cause prolonged droughts and water shortages, as seen from 2019 to 2021, when water levels fell unprecedentedly low. The cumulative effects of climate change in conjunction with dam-building by a range of uncoordinated private operators may result in operators being unable to fulfil their power-generation targets.
Secondly, Singapore’s food security might be impacted. In 2020, almost 65% of its rice was imported from the lower Mekong region, with the majority coming from Thailand Vietnam providing about 20%. Given the threat that hydropower development poses to sediment flow and therefore agricultural productivity, Singapore – and other countries – should consider the trade-offs between energy, water and food in the region carefully.
The long-term sustainability of hydropower dams on the Mekong is doubtful, given the uncertainties of climate change
Lastly, hydropower development is closely tied to geopolitical dynamics in Southeast Asia, particularly China’s economic and political influence. China is the second-largest investor in Laos’ power-generation sector after Thailand. Concerns over Laos’ high level of indebtedness to China were heightened in 2021, when the Laotian government granted a 25-year concession to a Chinese company to build, manage and control its power grid. The country’s high levels of dependency on Chinese investment in its hydropower and power-generation sector may have knock-on effects on ASEAN unity when it comes to managing the association’s complicated relationship with China in other areas.
On the surface, Singapore’s decision to import renewable energy appears to be a useful way to meet its climate goals. Its National Climate Change Secretariat notes that more than 95% of Singapore’s energy is fuelled by natural gas. The island nation’s options to decarbonise its energy sector through reducing its fossil fuel dependency is limited by its small land size and lack of natural resources. Similarly, renewable energy plays a growing role in Thailand’s Power Development Plan, and in 2021 Thailand agreed to buy electricity from an additional three planned Mekong mainstream dams in Laos. However, it is worth noting that the strong environmental movements against dams in Thailand have contributed to these decisions to import hydropower instead. It will serve these countries well to reconsider whether imported Laotian hydropower can truly be considered ‘sustainable’.

This article lists hydroelectric power stations that generate power using the conventional dammed method. This list includes power stations that are larger than 1,000 MW in maximum net capacity, and are operational or under construction. Those power stations that are smaller than 1,000 MW, or those that are only at a planning/proposal stage may be found in regional lists, listed at the end of the page.
The largest hydroelectric power station is the Three Gorges Dam in China, rated at 22,500 MW in total installed capacity. After passing on 7 December 2007 the 14,000 MW mark of the Itaipu Dam, the facility was ranked as the largest power-generating facility ever built. The dam is 181 m (594 ft) high, 2,335 m (7,661 ft) long and 115 m (377 ft) in width. Power is generated by 32 turbines rated at 700 MW, and two turbines rated 50 MW, which are used to power the facility itself. Construction of this dam commenced in 1994, and was completed in 2012, nearly two decades after it started.
The next six largest dams after the Three Gorges Dam are the Itaipu Dam, Xiluodu Dam, Belo Monte Dam, Guri Dam, Wudongde Dam and the Tucurui Dam, rated at 14,000 MW, 13,860 MW, 11,233 MW, 10,235 MW, 10,200 MW and 8,370 MW respectively. All seven dams are the largest power-generating bodies respectively, before the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant at 8,212 MW, the largest non-renewable energy-generating facility in the world. The currently planned Grand Inga Dam would be nearly twice the size of the Three Gorges Dam at 39,000 MW, surpassing all power-generating facilities once it passes the current-highest 22,500 MW mark.

The Future of Hydroelectric in Michigan
A Responsible Path for the Future
In Michigan, we love the water. We know how important our river hydro plants, and the reservoirs they create, are to the people living near them. People enjoy living, working and playing on the water and in the communities that have grown up near our 13 dams. But in the next 10 years, some of our hydro operating licenses issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), will expire. As we plan for a future of reliable, affordable clean energy we will take part in a multi-year review of all our hydroelectric plants.

Winter 2024 Updates
Community Meetings Recap
We would like to thank the thousands of community members, organizations, and municipal leaders who met with us at our community sessions. We listened and we heard clearly that that the reservoirs created by our dams are critically important to the residents that live there and the communities’ overall well-being. We are carefully considering the feedback that was shared with our team during those meetings.
Request for Proposals
As we continue to evaluate the future of the dams and consider all options to safely maintain the dam reservoirs, we are issuing a request for proposals (RFP) to explore the possibility of selling our 13 hydroelectric facilities. Selling the facilities is only one of many options for the future of our hydro facilities that remain in consideration. The RFP will open Feb. 15, with participants moving through a two-stage evaluation and bidding process that should finish by the end of 2024.
RFP Instructions can be found here.
Entities interested in participating can immediately register their interest and submit initial bids by March 15. For more information and to register, contact Ryan Cook of Clear Energy Brokerage & Consulting LLC at ryan.cook@clearenergybrokerage.com or 616-528-4682.
A Review of Current Hydro Operations
A detailed review of our 13 river hydro plants will help us choose the best path forward.
For each plant there are several potential results. It could lead to a renewal of our operating license for 30 more years. It could also lead to replacing or removal of the plant. A transfer of ownership is another possibility. During each review we will be looking at the following:

Safety
We will inspect the safety of each plant. We will also review the condition of the plant. On top of that we will review what could happen to people living downstream if a dam fails.

Complying with Regulations
We will evaluate the cost and feasibility of operating each plant safely, while meeting state and federal regulations.

Community
We will explore how each hydro plant and reservoir has affected the community and the areas around it. We will also explore how potential changes to the hydro plant could affect the community.

Cost of Operation
We will explore expected future spending for operating each plant. We will also add up the electricity we expect each plant to generate.

Environment
We will explore the impact of each plant on the environment. We will look at sediments, fish and other animals, invasive species, and other ways the plant affects the environment.

Recreation
We will review the impact of each hydro plant on local recreation.

2022 MEETING DOCUMENTS













































2023 MEETING DOCUMENTS


























































Federal and State Oversight
Everyone that is involved in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensing process is acutely aware of how final decisions will impact river hydro communities. We are committed to holding intentional interactions with all regulatory stakeholders in this process, including the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, to advocate for the most positive outcomes for customers and other residents in these valued river hydro communities. 
Questions About Hydro Planning
Why are you hosting a community meeting about the dam near me?




How does dam relicensing work?



Can we use the reservoirs for recreation during the planning process?

Is this process the same as the state’s dam safety task force?

How can I get more information and stay informed during the process?

How will you use comments from meetings? Will comments be addressed?

What is involved in the hydro relicensing process?

What is the potential timeline for relicensing and decommissioning dams?



How does hydropower fit into your renewable energy sources?
How is hydroelectric power produced and distributed?
How do you measure the condition of the dams?

If Consumers Energy sells their hydros, how can you assure the community that the reservoir will stay?
Who could be potential buyers of these facilities?
If Consumers Energy moved forward with selling their hydroelectric facilities, what would it mean for the reservoirs?
If Consumers Energy sells the hydro facilities, how do we know if they will still be safe?

We celebrated the legacy of Dr. Henry Acres, hydro power pioneer and founder of engineering consulting company H.G Acres, later renamed Acres International. Hatch has been able to continue the legacy of Dr. Acres through the purchase of Acres International in 2004. 
 
We joined The City of Niagara Falls and the hydro power industry to honour the significant impact that Dr. Acres had on the City of Niagara Falls by naming the final stretch of the Millennium Recreational Trail the Dr. Henry G. Acres Pathway, which fittingly runs along hydro canals.

I am thrilled to welcome new colleagues to Hatch in our eGRID business.   In 2023, Shekar Shanmugam joined us as our Global Director, eGRID (based in our Atlanta office) and Debi Jena joined us as our Regional Director, eGRID - Australasia (based in our Melbourne office).  Shekar and Debi bring decades of experience in the power industry, including consulting/engineering/project delivery and operations.

So what is eGRID you ask?    A few years ago we brought our Renewable Power and Transmission teams together to address the emerging transformation in the power sector.    Everyone loves acronyms so we coined the term ""eGRID"" to describe some of the changes we saw coming: electric Grid, Renewable, Intelligent, Dispatchable.

Our eGRID team serves our clients in three business lines:  Renewable Power, Power Transmission & Integration and Distribution & Smart Grid.   We have many world-class experts in #Powersystemstudies #HVDC #Energystorage #Gridmodernization and more!  Please reach out for assistance.

Why hydropower is the forgotten giant of clean energy

Why we need hydropower for a clean energy future
Hydropower is by far the largest renewable worldwide, producing over twice as much energy as wind, and over four times as much as solar. And pumping water up a hill, aka “pumped storage hydropower”, comprises well over 90% of the world’s total energy storage capacity. 
But in spite of hydropower’s outsize impact, we don’t hear much about it in the U.S. While the past few decades have seen wind and solar plummet in price and skyrocket in availability, domestic hydropower generation has remained relatively steady, as the nation has already built hydropower plants in the most geographically ideal locations.
Internationally, it’s a different story. China has fueled its economic expansion by building thousands of new, often massive, hydroelectric dams over the last few decades. Africa, India, and other countries in Asia and the Pacific are set to do the same.
But expansion without strict environmental oversight could lead to trouble, as dams and reservoirs disrupt river ecosystems and surrounding habitats, and recent studies show that reservoirs can emit more carbon dioxide and methane than previously understood. Plus, climate-driven drought is making hydro a less reliable source of energy, as dams in the American West have lost a significant amount of their electricity generating capacity.
“In a typical year, Hoover Dam will generate about 4.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy,” said Mark Cook, Manager of the iconic Hoover Dam. “With the lake being the way it is now, it’s more like 3.5 billion kilowatt hours.”
Yet experts say that hydro has a big role to play in a 100% renewable future, so learning how to mitigate these challenges is a must.
Domestic hydropower
In 2021, hydropower accounted for about 6% of utility-scale electricity generation in the U.S. and 32% of renewable electricity generation. Domestically, it was the largest renewable until 2019, when it was surpassed by wind.
The U.S. isn’t expected to see much hydropower growth in the coming decade, in part due to the onerous licensing and permitting process.
“It costs tens of millions of dollars and years of effort to go through the licensing process. And for some of these facilities, particularly some of the smaller facilities, they just don’t have that money or that time,” says Malcolm Woolf, President and CEO of the National Hydropower Association. He estimates that there are dozens of different agencies involved in licensing or re-licensing a single hydropower facility. The process, he said, takes longer than licensing a nuclear plant.
The Shasta Dam in Shasta County, California began generating power in 1945.

Because the average hydroelectric plant in the U.S. is over 60 years old, many will need to be relicensed soon.
“So we could be facing a raft of license surrenders, which is ironic just as we’re trying to ramp up the amount of flexible, carbon-free generation we have in this country,” Woolf said.
But the Department of Energy says there is potential for domestic growth, through upgrades to old plants and adding power to existing dams.
“We have 90,000 dams in this country, most of which were built for flood control, for irrigation, for water storage, for recreation. Only 3% of those dams are actually used for generating power,” said Woolf.
Growth in the sector also relies on expanding pumped storage hydropower, which is gaining traction as a way to “firm” renewables, storing excess energy for use when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.
When a pumped storage facility is generating power, it operates just like a regular hydro plant: Water flows from the upper reservoir to the lower, spinning an electricity-generating turbine along the way. The difference is that a pumped storage facility can recharge, using power from the grid to pump water from below up to the higher reservoir, thereby storing potential energy that can be released when needed. 
While pumped storage has about 22 gigawatts of electricity-generating capacity today, there’s over 60 gigawatts of proposed projects in the development pipeline. That’s second only to China.
In recent years, permits and licensing applications for pumped storage systems have increased considerably, and new technologies are being considered. These include “closed-loop” facilities, in which neither reservoir is connected to an outside water source, or smaller facilities that use tanks instead of reservoirs. Both methods would likely be less disruptive to the surrounding environment.
Emissions and drought
Damming rivers or creating new reservoirs can obstruct fish migration and ruin surrounding ecosystems and habitats. Dams and reservoirs have even displaced tens of millions of people throughout history, usually indigenous or rural communities.
These harms are widely acknowledged. But a new challenge — emissions from reservoirs — is now gaining increased attention.
″What people don’t realize is that these reservoirs actually emit a lot of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, both of which are strong greenhouse gases,” said Ilissa Ocko, Senior Climate Scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.
The emissions come from decomposing vegetation and other organic matter, which break down and release methane when an area is flooded to create a reservoir. “Usually that methane then turns into carbon dioxide, but you need oxygen in order to do that. And if the water is really, really warm, then the bottom layers are depleted of oxygen,” said Ocko, meaning that methane is then released into the atmosphere.
When it comes to warming the world, methane is over 80 times more potent than CO2 for the first 20 years after its release. So far, research shows that hotter parts of the world, like India and Africa, tend to have more polluting plants, while Ocko says that reservoirs in China and the U.S. are not of particular concern. But Ocko says there needs to be a more robust way to measure emissions.
“And then you could have all sorts of incentives to reduce it, or regulations by different authorities to make sure that you’re not emitting too much,” Ocko said.
Another major problem for hydropower is climate-driven drought. Shallow reservoirs produce less power, and that’s of particular concern in the American West, which has seen the driest 22-year period in the last 1,200 years.
Lake Mead, the large reservoir located in Nevada and Arizona that feeds the Hoover Dam, is at an all-time low. The white rocks indicate the water level of the lake when it is full.

As reservoirs like Lake Powell, which feeds the Glen Canyon Dam, and Lake Mead, which feeds the Hoover Dam, produce less electricity, fossil fuels are picking up the slack. One study found that from 2001-2015, an additional 100 million tons of carbon dioxide were released across 11 states in the west because of the drought-induced shift away from hydropower. During a particularly rough patch for California between 2012-2016, another study estimated that lost hydropower generation cost the state $2.45 billion.
For the first time in history, a water shortage has been declared at Lake Mead, triggering water allocation cuts in Arizona, Nevada and Mexico. The water level, currently at 1,047 feet, is expected to drop further, as the Bureau of Reclamation has taken the unprecedented step of holding back water at Lake Powell, situated upriver of Lake Mead, so that the Glen Canyon Dam can continue to produce power. If Lake Mead drops below 950 feet, it will no longer generate power.
Future of hydropower
Modernizing existing hydropower infrastructure could increase efficiency and recoup some drought-related losses, as well as ensure that plants are able to operate for many decades to come. 
Between now and 2030, $127 billion will be spent on modernizing old plants globally. That accounts for nearly one fourth of total global hydropower investment, and nearly 90% of investment in Europe and North America.
At Hoover Dam, that’s meant retrofitting some of their turbines to operate more efficiently at lower elevations, installing thinner wicket gates, which control the flow of water into the turbines and injecting compressed air into the turbines to increase efficiency.
But in other parts of the world, the majority of investment is going toward new plants. Large, state-owned projects in Asia and Africa are expected to account for over 75% of new hydropower capacity through 2030. But some worry about the impact such projects will have on the environment.
“In my humble opinion, they’re overbuilt. They’re built to massive capacity that isn’t necessary,” Shannon Ames, Executive Director of the Low Impact Hydropower Institute said, “They could be done as run-of-river and they could just be designed differently.”
Run-of-river facilities don’t include a reservoir, and thus have less impact on the environment, but they cannot generate energy on demand, since output depends on seasonal flows. Run-of-river hydropower is expected to account for about 13% of total capacity additions this decade, while traditional hydropower will make up 56% and pumped hydro 29%.
But overall, hydropower growth is slowing, and is set to contract by about 23% through 2030.. Reversing this trend will largely depend on streamlining the regulatory and permitting processes, and setting high sustainability standards and emissions measuring programs to ensure community acceptance. A shorter development timeline would help developers obtain power purchase agreements,  thereby incentivizing investment since returns would be guaranteed.
“Part of the reason it doesn’t look as attractive sometimes as solar and wind is because the horizon for the facilities is different. For example, a wind and solar plant typically gets looked at as a 20 year project,” Ames said, “On the other hand, hydropower is licensed and operates for 50 years. And many of them have been operating for 100 years… But our capital markets don’t necessarily appreciate a longer return like that.”
Finding the right incentives for hydropower and pumped storage development, and ensuring that it’s done in a sustainable manner, is going to be critical to weaning the world off fossil fuels, Woolf says.
“We don’t get the headlines that some of the other technologies do. But I think folks are increasingly realizing that that you can’t have a reliable grid without hydropower.”

RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES
The percentage of renewable energy generated in Hawai‘i has doubled since 2014.
BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS (BESS)
Often included or integrated with renewable energy systems, battery energy storage systems store excess energy for use later. Batteries that store excess renewable energy and discharge when that energy is not available extends the usefulness and improves the predictable availability of renewable sources. Batteries come in various sizes ranging from home-use to utility-scale and can be made from a variety of rechargeable mineral elements. Currently, the most commonly known system is lithium-ion, but the industry is going through a significant transformative phase as scientists are innovating solutions to increase battery performance and diversify production options to lessen reliance on specific minerals.
BIOENERGY
Bioenergy comes from organic materials (anything that used to be alive or parts of a living thing, such as leaves, branches, wood chips, paper, algae, or manure). Biomass can be used to produce electricity, can be converted into liquid fuels (called “biofuels”), or can be burned to produce heat for cooking or other uses (such as wood in a barbecue grill).

Biomass
Biomass is plant and animal matter and includes energy crops, wood, grasses, algae, vegetable oils, and agricultural and municipal wastes.
Biofuels
Biofuels are liquid fuels made from biomass. As defined in Section 486J-1 of the Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, “Biofuels means liquid or gaseous fuels produced from organic sources such as biomass crops, agricultural residues, and oil crops such as palm oil, canola oil, soybean oil, waste cooking oil, grease, and food wastes, animal residues and wastes, and sewage and landfill wastes.” They include:
Ethanol
Biodiesel
Bio-based diesel fuel (also known as green diesel)
Bio-based gasoline (also known as green gasoline)
Bio-based jet fuel (including sustainable aviation fuel)
Bio-based pyrolysis oils
Hydrogen (from biomass sources)

GEOTHERMAL
Geothermal energy comes from heat inside the Earth. Geothermal energy can be harnessed to produce electricity and can also be used for heating and cooling purposes. It is particularly prevalent in Hawai‘i’s young islands, most notably on the volcanically active Hawai‘i Island. However, the resource is not limited to areas with volcanic activity. Geothermal energy can be generated anywhere there is adequate subsurface heat with underlying geology that allows for “optimum geothermal play” or a geological setting that includes a heat source, a migration pathway, a heat reservoir, and potential for economic recovery. Geothermal sources may be accessed through wells that tap into steam, hot water, or geothermal fluid that when brought to the surface can be used to turn turbines, which in turn drive generators to create electricity.
The Kilauea East Rift Zone, thus far the only region developed for geothermal energy in Hawai‘i, has all the attributes necessary for energy generation. Hawai‘i’s only currently operating geothermal facility, the 38-megawatt Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) power plant, is located in this region. Geothermal is a low carbon energy resource as it does not produce any greenhouse gas emissions and, as a steam-based resource, generally provides the same amount of output at all times of the day. In 2021, geothermal energy from PGV provided Hawai‘i Island with 17.6% of its electricity needs. Prior to the Kīlauea eruption in 2018, geothermal energy from PGV provided an estimated 31% of the island’s energy.
Other areas in Hawai‘i have been studied and show suitable attributes for geothermal energy generation. In general, the probability of accessible geothermal heat decreases as you move up the island chain to the older islands; however, certain areas on these islands, including Oʻahu, where energy demand is high, exhibit geothermal resource probabilities that may make it plausible for electricity generation. Probabilities are believed to be higher in areas of rejuvenated volcanism, such as areas on the south flank of the Koʻolau mountain range (Ito, et al., 2017).

HYDROELECTRIC (HYDROPOWER)
Flowing water — in Hawai‘i’s streams, rivers, reservoirs, pipes, and irrigation ditches — can be used to generate electricity. Hydroelectric facilities were among the first power plants in the islands, dating back to the late 1800s. Some of Hawai‘i’s existing hydroelectric plants date back to the early 1900s and have been maintained and upgraded to continue producing power. Currently, only the islands of Kauaʻi, Hawai‘i, and Maui have operating hydroelectric plants. Collectively, hydroelectric projects provided 1.2% of all electricity sold by Hawai‘i’s electric utilities to their customers in 2021.
Hawai‘i has “run-of-the-river” hydro plants, which means free-flowing water is used to spin a turbine and generate electricity. For these projects, a regulated volume of water is diverted from its natural waterway into the pumphouse and then rerouted back to its original waterway. The amount of energy generated by a run-of-the-river hydro plant depends on the volume of water in a waterway and the speed at which is flows. Electrical output from Hawai‘i’s hydro plants is heavily impacted by annual rainfall due to reliance on surface waters.
Another hydroelectric resource being explored in Hawai‘i is “pumped storage.” When extra electricity is available, pumped storage hydroelectric facilities pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir, where the water is stored (similar in concept to charging a battery). When power is needed, the water is released back down through a turbine to the lower reservoir. Pumped storage is more of a “closed loop” system — meaning it does not rely on external inputs of water to normally operate — which reduces reliance on rainfall. The exception is that water loss due to evaporation and natural seepage can occur, in which case the reservoir can be replenished with water from nearby waterways and rainfall. Unlike run-of-the-river plants, pumped storage hydro projects allow operators to control when a hydroelectric facility discharges electricity. In many cases, including the West Kauaʻi Energy Project now being pursued on Kauaʻi, solar energy is used to pump the water “upstream” from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir, making these facilities 100% renewable.

HYDROGEN
Hydrogen has several uses and applications. It is used as a transportation fuel. It can also be produced from renewable sources, stored, and then used in vehicles or to produce electricity. The production of hydrogen can be timed to make use of excess renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted (curtailed); likewise, the use of hydrogen to produce electricity can be timed to meet peak electricity demands. Like other energy storage systems, in theory hydrogen can be dispatchable: supporting the grid by absorbing excess electricity supply, and providing electricity to meet demand when needed. Finally, it can be blended and distributed through pipelines for use in homes and businesses as a component of utility gas.
OCEAN
The ocean holds a great deal of the Earth’s energy — the Sun heats the surface, wind creates waves, and tidal forces exerted by the Sun and the Moon create tidal fluxes. Hawai‘i has significant wave and ocean thermal resources but minimal potential for tidal energy due to its relatively mild tidal changes. Most potential technologies that would harness ocean energy resources are in early pilot stages and have not yet been commercialized.
Thermal Energy (heat)
Two major ocean thermal technologies are of interest in Hawai‘i: seawater air conditioning (SWAC) and ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). Both rely on the fact that the deep ocean is significantly colder than the tropical surface. Thanks to the volcanic nature of Hawai‘i’s islands rising from the seafloor, this deep cold water is close to shore in many locations.
The Hawai‘i Ocean Science & Technology Park at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawai‘i Authority (NELHA) on the Kona coast of Hawai‘i Island hosts Hawai‘i’s only active OTEC project — a pilot project developed by Makai Ocean Engineering called the Ocean Energy Research Center. NELHA also uses sea water air conditioning for its visitor center and other buildings on site.
SWAC projects have also been proposed off Honolulu; however, none have yet come to fruition.
Marine Hydrokinetic Energy (motion – wave or tidal)
Marine hydrokinetic (MHK) technologies tap the kinetic energy of the ocean — the energy carried by moving water. Most typically, the ocean’s motion is converted to useable electricity by a device that either spins as the water flows past it or bobs up and down in the water. This means MHK facilities can generate more electricity from the oscillating (short period) rough seas created by trade winds than the slow and spread out (long period) swells that generate the famously large waves in Hawai‘i. Therefore, Hawai‘i’s relatively consistent trade winds are attractive for MHK developers. 
Hawai‘i hosts one of the world’s most unique MHK test facilities: Wave Energy Test Site (WETS) off the Kāneʻohe Marine Corps Base Hawai‘i (KMCBH) on Oʻahu. The WETS is a grid-connected hub on the bottom of the seafloor a few miles of KMCBH that enables MHK or wave buoys of various designs and manufacturers to connect to a grid-connected undersea hub. In partnership with the Hawai‘i National Marine Renewable Energy Center connected to the Hawai‘i Natural Energy Institute and the University of Hawai‘i, wave buoy manufacturers can test the performance of their wave buoy designs. KMCBH is located on the east coast of Oʻahu, which gets the brunt of the trade winds. 
SOLAR
Solar energy is energy in the form of light and heat from the Sun. Solar energy is harnessed for use and electricity generation primarily with two categories of solar energy system technologies: solar thermal and solar photovoltaics. Solar photovoltaics are most common for electricity production, while solar thermal systems offer significant energy savings through solar water heaters.

Photovoltaics
Photovoltaic (PV) systems do not have the moving parts (such as turbines) or steam production found in most other electricity generation systems. Instead, the sunlight shines on the solar cell and causes a voltage differential (photo voltaic) which generates direct electric current to be generated. Thousands of photovoltaic systems are in use in Hawai‘i. Some generate power for use on-site (such as on residential, commercial, and other buildings) in systems that are known as distributed energy resources, while other (larger) systems generate power that is provided directly to electric utilities to power the grid.
Solar Thermal

Solar thermal systems (including solar water heaters) use the Sun’s energy to heat water for residential use (up to 160°F); industrial use, including air conditioning, plastic forming, and desalination (170°-750°F); or electricity generation (750°-2,000°F).
Tens of thousands of solar water heaters are used in residences throughout Hawai‘i, reducing utility costs for users by eliminating the need for traditional grid-powered water heaters.
Facilities that use solar thermal energy to generate electricity most commonly do so by concentrating solar thermal energy into a small area to heat working fluids (commonly water) to generate steam and drive a heat engine turbine to produce power; this is called concentrated solar power (CSP). The technology is not currently in use in Hawai‘i.

WIND
Onshore Wind
Onshore Wind, or wind that is sited on land, has been developed on Oʻahu, Maui, and Hawai‘i Island. In total, nine utility-scale wind projects accounted for 8.1% of the total energy sales in the state in 2021. Onshore wind has not been a desirable technology in areas where there are large populations of endangered bird species. For example, on Kauaʻi, where there are large populations of seabirds, onshore wind has not been developed.

View Wind Map
Wind turbines used for electrical generation primarily come in two design variants (horizontal axis and vertical axis) and three size classifications (utility, community, and distributed). Most of the wind capacity installed in Hawai‘i is utility-scale horizontal axis turbines.
Offshore Wind
Offshore wind, or wind energy that is sited in the ocean, has not yet been developed in Hawai‘i and there is currently no timeline or specific plan to develop offshore wind in Hawai‘i’s waters. The discussion on the development of offshore wind has focused on projects connected to Oʻahu, as Oʻahu has the highest population, greatest electric use, and limited land space for the development of renewable energy. With the advancement of floating turbines, offshore wind has become more feasible for use in Hawaiʻi. Due to the volcanic formation of the islands, the ocean depth drops steeply off the coastline, making fixed-structure turbines (or structures that are mounted on the seafloor) infeasible. If developed, offshore wind facilities would be a floating turbine design with transmission by undersea cables
In 2021, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published the study titled The Cost and Feasibility of Floating Offshore Wind Energy in the Oahu Region. HSEO collaborated with Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and local stakeholders to develop the scope of the cost and feasibility study, which served to provide estimates of the cost of energy in regions of interest around Oʻahu while considering the technologies, ports, and grid connections that may impact the cost.

RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS (RNG)
Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) also know as biogas, is a form of gaseous energy created from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater biosolids, food wastes or animal manure under anaerobic conditions, or conditions without oxygen. Gas produced in this manner for production and use is pipeline quality and interchangeable with conventional natural gas, including synthetic natural gas (SNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG), both currently used in Hawaiʻi.
There is currently one RNG plant located on O‘ahu, which utilizes the methane from the Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant. The facility produces enough gas for more than 6,000 homes.
More information on the Honouliuli Natural Gas Plant operated by Hawai‘i Gas is available at: https://www.hawaiigas.com/clean-energy/decarbonization

Title
View of the Ķegums Hydro Power Plant Construction Site, August 19, 1937.
Summary
Eduards Kraucs (1898--1977) was a renowned Latvian photographer and cinematographer who, between 1936 and 1940, documented the construction of the Ķegums Hydro Power Plant on the Daugava River in central Latvia. This photograph, taken on August 19, 1937, shows the construction site with the new metal bridge over the river in the foreground; part of its architectonic shape was preserved until September 1986. Housing for engineers and workers can be seen in the background, on the right bank. The plant was a unique engineering structure for the Baltic countries and Northern Europe, involving a collaborative effort of Latvian and Swedish engineers. Technological solutions new to Europe were used in its construction. The plant had great importance in Latvia as a symbol of state and national identity during the first period of the history of the independent Latvian state (1918--1940). Its completion marked the beginning of a unified statewide power system and of the Latvenergo group. The plant triggered rapid economic growth, resulted in the electrification of Latvia's regions, and improved the welfare of the Latvian population. Kraucs took images of the work once or twice a week during the period of construction. The resulting collection of 1,736 glass plate photonegatives is the only known example in Europe of such a comprehensive photographic record of a large-scale building project. The collection was inscribed on the Latvian National Memory of the World Register in 2009.

Summary
All energy sources have negative effects. But they differ enormously in size: as we will see, fossil fuels are the dirtiest and most dangerous, while nuclear and modern renewable energy sources are vastly safer and cleaner. From the perspective of both human health and climate change, it matters less whether we transition to nuclear power or renewable energy and more that we stop relying on fossil fuels.
Energy has been critical to the human progress we’ve seen over the last few centuries. As the United Nations rightly says: “energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today.”
But while energy brings us massive benefits, it’s not without its downsides. Energy production can have negative impacts on human health and the environment in three ways.
The first is air pollution: millions of people die prematurely every year as a result of air pollution. Fossil fuels and the burning of biomass – wood, dung, and charcoal – are responsible for most of those deaths.
The second is accidents. This includes accidents in the mining and extracting of fuels – coal, uranium, rare metals, oil, and gas. It also includes accidents in transporting raw materials and infrastructure, the construction of the power plant, or their maintenance.
The third is greenhouse gas emissions: fossil fuels are the main source of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change. In 2020, 91% of global CO2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry.1
No energy source is completely safe. They all have short-term impacts on human health, either through air pollution or accidents. And they all have long-term impacts by contributing to climate change.
But, their contribution to each differs enormously. Fossil fuels are both the dirtiest and most dangerous in the short term and emit the most greenhouse gases per unit of energy. This means that there are thankfully no trade-offs here: low-carbon energy sources are also the safest. From the perspective of both human health and climate change, it matters less whether we transition to nuclear power or renewable energy and more that we stop relying on fossil fuels.
Nuclear and renewables are far, far safer than fossil fuels
Before we consider the long-term impacts of climate change, let’s look at how each source stacks up in terms of short-term health risks.
To make these comparisons fair, we can’t just look at the total deaths from each source: fossil fuels still dominate our global electricity mix, so we would expect that they would kill more people.
Instead, we compare them based on the estimated number of deaths they cause per unit of electricity. This is measured in terawatt-hours. One terawatt-hour is about the same as the annual electricity consumption of 150,000 citizens in the European Union.2
This includes deaths from air pollution and accidents in the supply chain.3
Let’s look at this comparison in the chart. Fossil fuels and biomass kill many more people than nuclear and modern renewables per unit of electricity. Coal is, by far, the dirtiest.
Even then, these estimates for fossil fuels are likely to be very conservative. They are based on power plants in Europe, which have good pollution controls and are based on older models of the health impacts of air pollution. As I discuss in more detail at the end of this article, global death rates from fossil fuels based on the most recent research on air pollution are likely to be even higher.
Our perceptions of the safety of nuclear energy are strongly influenced by two accidents: Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and Fukushima in Japan in 2011. These were tragic events. However, compared to the millions that die from fossil fuels every year, the final death tolls were very low. To calculate the death rates used here, I assume a death toll of 433 from Chernobyl, and 2,314 from Fukushima.4 If you are interested, I look at how many died in each accident in detail in a related article.
The other source which is heavily influenced by a few large-scale accidents is hydropower. Its death rate since 1965 is 1.3 deaths per TWh. This rate is almost completely dominated by one event: the Banqiao Dam Failure in China in 1975. It killed approximately 171,000 people. Otherwise, hydropower was very safe, with a death rate of just 0.04 deaths per TWh – comparable to nuclear, solar, and wind.
Finally, we have solar and wind. The death rates from both of these sources are low but not zero. A small number of people die in accidents in supply chains – ranging from helicopter collisions with turbines, fires during the installation of turbines or panels, and drownings on offshore wind sites.
People often focus on the marginal differences at the bottom of the chart – between nuclear, solar, and wind. This comparison is misguided: the uncertainties around these values mean they are likely to overlap.
The key insight is that they are all much, much safer than fossil fuels.
Nuclear energy, for example, results in 99.9% fewer deaths than brown coal; 99.8% fewer than coal; 99.7% fewer than oil; and 97.6% fewer than gas. Wind and solar are just as safe.
Putting death rates from energy in perspective
Looking at deaths per terawatt-hour can seem abstract. Let’s try to put it in perspective.
Let’s consider how many deaths each source would cause for an average town of 150,000 people in the European Union, which – as I’ve said before – consumes one terawatt-hour of electricity per year. Let’s call this town ‘Euroville’.
If Euroville were completely powered by coal, we’d expect at least 25 people to die prematurely every year from it.  Most of these people would die from air pollution.
This is how a coal-powered Euroville would compare with towns powered entirely by each energy source:
Coal: 25 people would die prematurely every year;
Oil: 18 people would die prematurely every year;
Gas: 3 people would die prematurely every year;
Hydropower: In an average year, 1 person would die;
Wind: In an average year, nobody would die. A death rate of 0.04 deaths per terawatt-hour means every 25 years, a single person would die;
Nuclear: In an average year, nobody would die – only every 33 years would someone die.
Solar: In an average year, nobody would die – only every 50 years would someone die.
The safest energy sources are also the cleanest
The good news is that there is no trade-off between the safest sources of energy in the short term and the least damaging for the climate in the long term. They are one and the same, as the chart below shows.
In the chart on the left-hand side, we have the same comparison of death rates from accidents and air pollution that we just looked at. On the right, we have the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of electricity production.
These are not just the emissions from the burning of fuels but also the mining, transportation, and maintenance over a power plant’s lifetime.5
Coal, again, is the dirtiest fuel. It emits much more greenhouse gases than other sources – hundreds of times more than nuclear, solar, and wind.
Oil and gas are also much worse than nuclear and renewables but to a lesser extent than coal.
Unfortunately, the global electricity mix is still dominated by fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas account for around 60%. If we want to stop climate change, we have a great opportunity in front of us: we can transition away from them to nuclear and renewables and also reduce deaths from accidents and air pollution as a side effect.6
This transition will not only protect future generations, but it will also come with huge health benefits for the current one.
Methodology and notes
Global average death rates from fossil fuels are likely to be even higher than reported in the chart above
The death rates from coal, oil, and gas used in these comparisons are sourced from the paper of Anil Markandya and Paul Wilkinson (2007) in the medical journal, The Lancet. To date, these are the best peer-reviewed references I could find on the death rates from these sources. These rates are based on electricity production in Europe.
However, there are three key reasons why I think that these death rates are likely to be very conservative, and the global average death rates could be substantially higher.
European fossil fuel plants have strict pollution controls. Power plants in Europe tend to produce less pollution than the global average and much less than plants in many low-to-middle-income countries. This means that the pollution generated per unit of electricity will likely be higher in other parts of the world.
In other countries, more people will live closer to power plants and be exposed to more pollution. If two countries produce the same amount of coal power and both have the same pollution controls, the country where power plants are closer to urban centers and cities will have a higher death toll per TWh. This is because more people will be exposed to higher levels of pollution. Power plants in countries such as China tend to be located closer to cities in many countries than they are in Europe, so we would expect the death rate to be higher than the European figures found by Markandya and Wilkinson (2007).7
More recent research on air pollution suggests the health impacts are more severe than earlier research suggested. The analysis by Markandya and Wilkinson was published in 2007. Since then, our understanding of the health impacts of air pollution has increased significantly. More recent research suggests the health impacts are more severe. My colleague, Max Roser, shows this evolution of the research on air pollution deaths in his review of the literature here. Another reason to suspect that the global average rates are much higher is the following: if we take the death rates from Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) and multiply them by global electricity production, the resulting estimates of total global deaths from fossil fuel electricity are much lower than the most recent research. If I multiply the Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) death rates for coal, oil, and gas by their respective global electricity outputs in 2021, I get a total death toll of 280,000 people.8 This is much lower than the estimates from more recent research. For example, Leliveld et al. (2018) estimate that 3.6 million die from fossil fuels yearly.9 Vohra et al. (2021) estimate more than double this figure: 8.7 million.10 Not all deaths from fossil fuel air pollution are due to electricity production. But we can estimate how many deaths do. In a recent paper, Leliveld and his colleagues estimated the breakdown of air pollution deaths by sector. They estimate that 12% of all (fossil fuel and pollution from other sources) air pollution deaths come from electricity production.11
By my calculations, we would expect that 1.1 million to 2.55 million people die from fossil fuels used for electricity production each year.12 The estimates we get from Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) death rates undercount by a factor of 4 to 9. This would suggest that actual death rates from fossil fuels could be 4 to 9 times higher. That would give a global average death rate from coal of 93 to 224 deaths per TWh. Unfortunately, we do not have more up-to-date death rates for coal, oil, and gas to reference here, but improved estimates are sorely needed. The current death rates shown are likely to be underestimated.
We need a timely global database on accidents in energy supply chains
The figures we reference on accidents from nuclear, solar, and wind are based on the most comprehensive figures we have to date. However, they are imperfect, and no timely dataset tracking these accidents exists. This is a key gap in our understanding of the safety of energy sources – and how their safety changes over time.
To estimate death rates from renewable energy technologies, Sovacool et al. (2016) compiled a database of energy-related accidents across academic databases and news reports. They define an accident as “an unintentional incident or event at an energy facility that led to either one death (or more) or at least $50,000 in property damage,” which is consistent with definitions in the research literature.
This raises several questions about which incidents should and shouldn’t be attributed to a given energy technology. For example, included in this database were deaths related to an incident where water from a water tank ruptured during a construction test at a solar factory. It’s not clear whether these supply chain deaths should or shouldn’t be attributed to solar technologies.
The comparability of these incidents across the different energy technologies is, therefore, difficult to assess with high certainty. One additional issue with this analysis by Sovacool et al. (2016) is that its database search was limited to English reports or non-English reports that had been translated. Some of these comparisons could therefore be a slight over- or underestimate. It is, however, unlikely that the position of these technologies would change significantly – renewable and nuclear technologies would consistently come out with a much lower death rate than fossil fuels. Consistent data collection and tracking of incidents across all energy technologies would greatly improve these comparisons.
We need improved estimates of the health impacts of the mining of minerals and materials for all energy sources
The figures presented in this research that I rely on do not include any health impacts from radiation exposure from the mining of metals and minerals used in supply chains.
While we might think that this would only have an impact on nuclear energy, analyses suggest that the carcinogenic toxicity of other sources – including solar, wind, hydropower, coal and gas are all significantly higher across their supply chains.13
These figures only measure potential exposure to toxic elements for workers. They do not give us estimates of potential death rates, which is why we do not include them in our referenced figures above.
However, the inclusion of these figures would not change the relative results, overall. Fossil fuels – coal, in particular – have a higher carcinogenic toxicity than both nuclear and renewables. Hence the relative difference between them would actually increase, rather than decrease. The key insight would still be the same: fossil fuels are much worse for human health, and both nuclear and modern renewables are similarly safe alternatives.
However, estimates of the health burden of rare minerals in energy supply chains is still an important gap to fill, so that we can learn about their impact and ultimately reduce these risks moving forward.

Per capita electricity consumption in the EU-27 in 2021 was around 6,400 kWh.
1 terawatt-hour is equal to 1,000,000,000 kilowatt-hours. So, we get this figure by dividing 1,000,000,000 by 6,400 ≈ 150,000 people.
The following sources were used to calculate these death rates.
Fossil fuels and biomass = these figures are taken directly from Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P. (2007). Electricity generation and health. The Lancet, 370(9591), 979-990.
Nuclear = I have calculated these figures based on the assumption of 433 deaths from Chernobyl and 2,314 from Fukushima. These figures are based on the most recent estimates from UNSCEAR and the Government of Japan. In a related article, I detail where these figures come from.
I have calculated death rates by dividing this figure by cumulative global electricity production from nuclear from 1965 to 2021, which is 96,876 TWh.
Hydropower = The paper by Sovacool et al. (2016) provides a death rate for hydropower from 1990 to 2013. However, this period excludes some very large hydropower accidents which occurred prior to 1990. I have therefore calculated a death rate for hydropower from 1965 to 2021 based on the list of hydropower accidents provided by Sovacool et al. (2016), which extends back to the 1950s. Since this database ends in 2013, I have also included the Saddle Dam accident in Laos in 2018, which killed 71 people.
The total number of deaths from hydropower accidents from 1965 to 2021 was approximately 176,000. 171,000 deaths were from the Banqian Dam Failure in China in 1975.
I have calculated death rates by dividing this figure by cumulative global electricity production from hydropower from 1965 to 2021, which is 138,175 TWh.
Solar and wind = these figures are taken directly from Sovacool, B. K., Andersen, R., Sorensen, S., Sorensen, K., Tienda, V., Vainorius, A., … & Bjørn-Thygesen, F. (2016). Balancing safety with sustainability: assessing the risk of accidents for modern low-carbon energy systems. Journal of Cleaner Production, 112, 3952-3965. In this analysis, the authors compiled a database of as many energy-related accidents as possible based on an extensive search of academic databases and news reports and derived death rates for each source from 1990 to 2013. Since this database has not been extended since then, it’s not possible to provide post-2013 death rates.

The IPCC AR5 report was published in 2014 and relies on studies conducted several years prior to its publication. For technologies that have been developing rapidly – namely solar, wind, and other renewables, production technologies, and intensities have changed significantly since then and will continue to change as energy systems decarbonize. Life-cycle figures for nuclear, solar, wind and hydropower have therefore been adopted by the more recent publication by Pehl et al. (2017), published in Nature Energy.

The Carbon Brief provides a clear discussion of the significance of these more recent lifecycle analyses in detail here.
Since oil is conventionally not used for electricity production, it is not included in the IPCC’s reported figures per kilowatt-hour. Figures for oil have therefore been taken from Turconi et al. (2013). It reports emissions in kilograms of CO2eq per megawatt-hour. Emissions factors for all other technologies are consistent with results from the IPCC. The range it gives for oil is 530–900: I have taken the midpoint estimate (715 kgCO2eq/MWh, or 715 gCO2eq/kWh).

The project involved the construction of a roller-compacted concrete (RCC) thick-arch dam in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico. The dam is 220 feet high and 1,230 feet long at the crest; it features an integral ski-jump spillway and has a volume of 380,000 yd³ of RCC.
The project also includes the construction of a crest access road, an intake structure, and a valve house with a control room. Thermal limitations for concrete fabrication and placement required the installation of a coarse aggregate cooling system (chilled water tunnel), and an ice flakes plant. Climatic and material availability conditions at the site necessitated the construction and operation of auxiliary facilities such as an aggregate processing plant, a sand washing plant, a high speed concrete conveying system, and two on-site concrete plants.

Is hydropower making a comeback in the Amazon?
Brazil’s government authorises studies for plants in the Amazon after a decade without new projects, rekindling energy debates in an election year

March 17, 2022
Seemingly out of nowhere, and after almost ten years without bids for new medium- or large-scale hydropower projects in Brazil, the federal government revealed in January that it is studying the possibility of three large plants in the Tapajós River basin, in the northwest of the state of Pará, in what is one of the best preserved areas of the Amazon.
“There was no prior conversation or announcement to the market. It was a real surprise,” said Roberto Kishinami of the Institute for Climate and Society Institute (ICS), an NGO based in Rio de Janeiro.
The possible resumption of such large-scale projects in the planet’s largest tropical forest has emerged in an election year for Brazil, as debates around climate change intensify. Last year, Brazil experienced its worst drought in over a century, exacerbated by global warming – for which a better preserved Amazon is seen as part of the solution.

The 881-megawatt (MW) Jamanxim plant, as well as the Cachoeira do Caí (802 MW) and Cachoeira dos Patos (528 MW) plants, are back on the political agenda in the capital Brasília – remnants of an ambitious project to build the largest hydroelectric complex in the country. Previous plans also included the giant São Luiz do Tapajós (8,040 MW) and Jatobá (1,650 MW) plants. Yet, they floundered in 2016 due to their enormous anticipated impacts on indigenous land.
Dams awaken outmoded energy plans
January’s announcement revived energy plans that seemed to have been consigned to the past. “In the 21st century, we have to look for alternative ways of generating energy,” said Juvêncio Cardoso, a researcher from the Federal University of Amazonas.
“Dams change the natural course of water, impacting biodiversity, the fish population and the lives of the peoples of the Amazon,” added Cardoso, who is also a leader of the Baniwa people and a teacher in the Alto Rio Negro indigenous territory, near the border with Colombia in Amazonas state.
Activist Antônia Melo, who in 2014 was evicted from her home in Altamira, northern Pará, when the Belo Monte mega-dam was under construction, said: “The experience of the peoples of the Xingu is that hydroelectric dams in the Amazon do not work. It doesn’t bring development and it’s not sustainable.”
The myth of hydroelectricity as a low-emission source has fallen apart
Inaugurated in 2016 by then president Dilma Rousseff, Belo Monte marked the end of a wave of building large hydropower projects in the Amazon, which began a few years earlier under her predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Belo Monte’s construction was marred by severe social and environmental problems that led to the Organization of American States filing a complaint against the Brazilian government. Riverside families were forcibly removed from their land and the livelihoods of the indigenous people of the Xingu’s Volta Grande region, home to several protected territories, altered drastically, with lower river levels recorded. The lack of planning for the arrival of 25,000 labourers to the region’s urban centres led to surging levels of violence, especially against women.
Belo Monte was also the target of hundreds of lawsuits and corruption investigations. The project’s infamy helped bury the debate on new dams in the Amazon – until now.
“The maxim was: no hydroelectric dams in the Amazon, no way,” said Luiz Eduardo Barata, an energy consultant who between 2016 and 2020 was director of the National Electric System Operator (ONS), the body responsible for energy planning in Brazil.
Dozens of dams in the Amazon
Research by Diálogo Chino, based on data from the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) shows that, besides the 32 hydroelectric power plants that currently operate in the Amazon, 31 are in the planning stages. A further 57 sites in the region have been identified as highly promising, in terms of their hydropower potential. Projects may or may not materialise, depending on proper feasibility studies, investor interest and political will. All these projects, their capacities and owners can be explored in the interactive map below.
Private investors, however, are reluctant to back Amazon hydropower, precisely because of the reputational damage that another Belo Monte fiasco could cause. “Hardly a single bank or private company would expose itself to enterprises of this nature, because there is already a well-established debate about the role of capital in preserving the Amazon,” Kishinami said.
Chinese-backed hydro plants
Caution is growing but there are already major investments in Amazon hydropower from Portuguese, Spanish, Canadian, German, Italian and French companies. Chinese companies have invested in six of the 63 plants that are already operating or are planned, data shows. The pandemic slowed a longer-term uptick in Chinese interest in the Brazilian energy sector, but it could now pick up again.
Chinese interest in hydro
Of the 63 hydroelectric plants that are already operating or planned in Brazil, six have Chinese involvement, Diálogo Chino’s investigations found.
In Rondônia state, a deal for the acquisition of the Santo Antônio power plant on the Madeira River by the Chinese State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) stalled in 2019. Despite a challenging political climate, the deal is back on the table, according to Charles Tang, president of the Brazil-China Chamber of Commerce.
“It has become much more difficult to travel, and face-to-face is important. But there is a second reason for the slower pace of business: the government has not been friendlier with the Chinese,” Tang said, referring to President Jair Bolsonaro’s antagonism towards China.
Bolsonaro is running for re-election later this year. Amazon deforestation has hit record highs under his watch and he has dismantled environmental protection agencies. And although Bolsonaro revived the debate about Amazon hydropower, both his record, and that of main opposition candidate Lula, who presided over the past dam-building boom, suggest a possible revitalisation of the controversial energy source. “In addition to destroying everything, this government is announcing more plants in the Amazon,” Melo said.
The building of large dams in the Amazon could return even bigger than before in the event of a new Lula government
Amid a pandemic-induced economic slump that has thrown thousands of Brazilians back into poverty, analysts fear that Worker’s Party candidate Lula, who currently leads the polls, could revive Amazon hydropower development as a strategy to boost the economy. “The project of building large hydroelectric dams in the Amazon is not only not over, but I suspect that it could return even bigger [than before] with an eventual Lula government,” Kishinami said.
“Hydroelectric dams mobilise a lot of capital, and it looks good for a government to say that it is inaugurating the second or third largest hydroelectric dam in the world,” said Roberto Schaeffer, a professor of energy planning at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).
Poor geographical and climate conditions
Research published in the journal Nature in 2019 found that the Brazilian Amazon has uniquely bad conditions for the construction of hydropower plants. Beyond the inherent socio-environmental impacts of large-scale projects in the middle of the rainforest, the region is very flat, so any reservoir requires flooding huge areas.
“The social and environmental impact of hydroelectric power is incomparable to any other type of energy,” said Philip Fearnside, a researcher at Amazon research institute INPA. Among the main consequences is the emission of methane, as the remains of tree trunks and plants decompose at the bottom of the reservoir.
The Nature study also reported how some hydroelectric plants, such as Balbina in Amazonas state, have even been found to be more polluting than coal-fired power plants, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. With this knowledge, “the myth of hydroelectricity as a low-emission source falls apart,” said Gustavo Pinheiro of ICS.
Below capacity

According to Brazil’s grid operator (ONS), Belo Monte has operated at only 24% of capacity, based on the monthly average of the last five years. It is not the only one: the Tucuruí, Jirau and Santo Antônio hydroelectric plants also performed poorly, with an average capacity of 40%, 49% and 55% respectively.
A standing forest is also vital in order to fend off climate change, and major hydropower development implies deforestation that also contributes to drought. Without rain, there is a lack of water to turn turbines and generate energy, especially in run-of-the-river hydro projects. These do not have sizeable reservoirs to store water for the dry season.
Belo Monte was projected to be Brazil’s largest hydroelectric plant with the capacity to generate 11,233 MW. However, it has been operating with only half of its 18 turbines during the dry season, generating less than 400 MW per month, or 3% of its capacity, according to ONS.
Over the last five years, Belo Monte has operated at an average of only 24% of capacity, ONS says. This problem affects other plants in the Amazon. At Tucuruí, on the Tocantins River, the average was 40%. Jirau and Santo Antônio, both on the Madeira River, operated at an average of 49% and 55% of their capacity, respectively.
“In the last decade, especially, hydro plants have not been able to deliver all the contracted energy due to lack of water. One explanation is that many hydro plants have lost efficiency since they were built, and the other is that in some basins there has been a reduction in rainfall,” Kishinami explained.
The reduction in the size of the Belo Monte reservoir, from 1,225 km2 in the original project to 478 km2, alleviated some civil society resistance to the mega-project. It also made the plant more dependent on rainwater.
From a technical point of view, hydroelectric power in Brazil no longer has a place
Belo Monte quickly proved to be a mistake. But not for lack of warning. In 2015, a study entitled “Brazil 2040”, commissioned by Rouseff’s own government, warned of “falls in the flow of hydroelectric reservoirs” with “enormous impacts” for the national system, “leading to a de-structuring of the system and unacceptable probabilities of [energy generation] deficit”.
Six years later, the worst drought in over 100 years hit Brazil, leading to its lowest ever rates of generation from hydropower. To avoid a blackout, the federal government turned on thermoelectric power plants, a highly polluting and more expensive source of energy. The move resulted in an increase in Brazilians’ electricity bills.
“Reality imposes itself, nature does not respect political decisions, the scenarios in Brazil 2040 are materialising and even worse than scientists predicted. I think this makes the plants unfeasible,” said Pinheiro.
For UFRJ’s Schaeffer, who coordinated the Brazil 2040 study, hydropower’s days could be numbered: “From a technical point of view, hydroelectric power in Brazil no longer has a place.”

One option for the future of hydropower plants in Brazil is the greater use of the reversible power plant model, in which the water not used during the rainy season is stored in a second reservoir. When water supply is lower or demand for energy is greater, the stored water supplies are pumped back to the plant.
Adjustments to the generation and distribution system could also help ease the dependence on hydropower. Experts unanimously agree that it is necessary to increase the share of wind and solar power in the Brazilian energy matrix. These sources currently account for less than 13% of electricity generated.
“There is a huge space for unconventional renewables, such as wind and solar power plants,” notes Barata, a former director of ONS. “Studies show that up to 40% of our consumption could come from these types of renewables.”

Such a shift would also allow changes to the way hydroelectric plants are used. Today, they are Brazil’s main source of energy, accounting for 58% of the matrix. Yet, since they work around the clock, they cannot store water for periods of greater demand or drought.
“The hydroelectric dam reservoirs are a huge battery within the system, but today it is impossible for them to stay full because they are generating energy all the time,” Kishinami said.
The equation seems simple: stimulate wind and solar when there is abundant sun and wind and, at times when demand exceeds generation, turn on the hydroelectric turbines. Today, it is the role of thermoelectric plants to back up the system.
“On top of everything, the thermoelectric plant can take several days to reach its full capacity. But in the hydroelectric plant, all you have to do is open the floodgates and in a few seconds it is generating power intensely,” said Kishinami.
For this to work, contracts with hydroelectric plants and the distribution system itself would need to be redrawn to incorporate greater capillarity – the flow of water throgh narrow spaces without relying on external forces, such as gravity.
According to Schaeffer, “a well connected system means that if at a time when there is sun in Bahia and there is a lot of wind in Pernambuco, all the other [hydroelectric plants] must stop generating energy to save water for when we have less”.
Several of these suggestions are included in the Ten Year Energy Expansion Plan 2031, a study by the federal government to guide the the sector. Concluded in January, the document foresees a reduction in the participation of hydroelectric plants in the Brazilian energy matrix – from 58% in 2021 to 45% in 2031 – compensated for by the expansion of wind and solar.
The energy generation debate dominates the conversation around hydropower in the Amazon. But it impacts so much more, according to Kishinami. “It is about the role of the Amazon for the country,” he said.
“We cannot forget that this type of undertaking puts its socio-environmental heritage at risk and leads to the extinction of hundreds of languages.”

QUICK FACTS
By capacity, the Grand Coulee Dam on Washington's Columbia River is the largest power plant in the United States, and the seventh-largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. It typically supplies about 21 million megawatthours of electricity annually to 8 western states and parts of Canada.
Washington generated more electricity from hydropower than any other state and accounted for 31% of the nation's total utility-scale hydroelectric generation in 2022.
Washington has the fifth-largest crude oil refining capacity in the nation and can process a combined total of almost 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day at the state's 5 refineries. 
In 2021, Washington consumed less natural gas than about half of the states, and in 2020, the state used less per capita than all but four other states and the District of Columbia. The largest share of the state's natural gas comes from Canada, either directly or through the state of Idaho.
Washington is part of the West Coast Electric Highway, and more than 66,000 all-electric vehicles are registered in the state, the fourth-most in the nation. As of February 2023, Washington had more than 1,600 public access electric vehicle charging stations with about 4,100 charging ports.

Brandon
Brandon was originally powered by 4 coal-fired generators. A fifth 105-MW coal-fired unit was added in 1970. The original 4 units were taken offline in 2001 and 2 combustion gas turbines were added. These 140-MW turbines use diesel fuel as a backup.
The last coal-fired unit was decommissioned in 2018. It now runs most of the year as a synchronous condenser which regulates our grid’s voltage in southwest Manitoba, but does not create any electricity of its own.
It is our fifth largest generating station.
The Brandon generating station is located on the south bank of the Assiniboine River in the City of Brandon.
Capacity 280 MW;
Construction started in 1958, upgrades added in 1969 and 2001;
2 combustion gas turbines;

Slave Falls
The name Slave Falls is derived from an Indigenous legend. While trying to escape across the river from a warrior who enslaved her, a young woman was swept over the falls to her death.
Powerful falls and a natural island divided the river at Slave and made it an ideal location for a power plant. The builders saved huge sums of money by using the island’s granite base as a foundation – earning it the nickname “Million Dollar Island”.
In 1931, the first unit went into service. The generating station has an average annual generation of 499 million kWh. In 1970, $743 thousand was spent to automate the Slave Falls plant, allowing it to be operated by remote control from the Pointe du Bois control room.
The Slave Falls generating station is located on the Winnipeg River, about 35 km east of Lac du Bonnet. The station is only accessible by a private road from Pointe du Bois.
Capacity 68 MW;
Cost $8.3 million;

Wuskwatim represents the first time we entered into a partnership with a First Nations community on a generating station project. The station is owned by the Wuskwatim Power Limited Partnership (WPLP), a legal entity involving Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) and Manitoba Hydro. We operate the station on behalf of the WPLP.
First Nations input was also critical during the design and planning phase of the project, which included combining traditional knowledge with scientific knowledge during the environmental assessment studies. Traditional knowledge will continue to play an important role in monitoring the operation of the project from an environmental perspective.
Wuskwatim’s low-head design meant the project created less than one half of a square kilometre of flooding, all contained within the immediate forebay area.
The Wuskwatim generating station is located on the Burntwood River, in the Nelson House Resource Management Area, approximately 45 km southwest of Thompson and 35 km southeast of Nelson House.
Capacity 211 MW;
Cost $1.3 billion;
Construction started in 2006 and completed in 2012;
3 turbine generators (vertical propeller type);
Transmission lines: 230 kV Thompson and Herblet Lake Station;
Powerhouse 118 metres long.

Hydropower in Sweden
Facts about hydropower
Facts about hydropower
In the Swedish electricity system, hydro power is currently Sweden’s largest source of renewable energy and accounts for approximately 45% of Swedish electricity generation. Together with nuclear power, hydropower is the foundation of the Swedish electricity system. Its operation causes no carbon emissions and the water is returned to the river after leaving the turbine.  
Image
Hydropower is a renewable energy source 
With its Swedish company, Sydkraft Hydropower AB, Uniper is Sweden’s third largest hydropower producer. Its 74 wholly and jointly owned hydro powerplants located from Lycksele in the North to Kristianstad in the South provide a combined output of approximately 1,700 MW and an annual delivery of about 8,000 GWh of renewable electricity. Corresponding to about 12% of Sweden’s total hydropower production. 
As the share of weather-dependent electricity generation (such as wind and solar power) in the electricity system increases, the role of hydropower will be even more important in the future, thanks to its unique contribution of renewable baseload power and balancing capacity. 
How hydropower works 
The water’s potential energy is harnessed for electricity generation. 
When the water is channeled into the turbine, it falls downward through a headrace or penstock. The water’s weight and momentum cause the turbine and generator to rotate. Potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. 
The kinetic energy is converted into electricity by the generator. 
The tailrace leads the water back to the river. 
The power is transferred from the generator to a transformer, where it is converted to a high voltage current before being distributed to customers via major power lines, incurring some minor transmission losses. 
Image
Hydropower electricity generation 
The volume of water in the rivers and landscape’s differences in elevation create the preconditions for hydropower plants. Watercourses that are most suited to power production either have a high head or large water flow. The amount of energy that can be generated from a hydro powerplant is directly related to the head and water volume. It is thus easy to understand why the greatest share of hydropower is produced in Northern Sweden’s rivers. Hydropower production usually entails the regulation of river flows. The water that is required for electricity generation is stored in reservoirs and can be used in the exact volume required at any given time. 
Significance of spring floods to hydropower 
The temperature determines when spring floods will occur. The floods usually occur sometime in April, when the spring weather first gets milder. The reservoirs are then refilled, after having lower levels during the winter months, when the water was bound by snow.

Critical factors include levels of precipitation in the Scandes mountain range during the year and, naturally, the amount of snow that melts into water in conjunction with the spring floods. 
By measuring snow depths in the Scandes mountain range, hydropower companies can forecast the inflows into reservoirs when spring flooding is underway.  
Image
During an annual cycle, the critical factors for hydropower can be divided into three areas. Snow depth in the winter, floods in the spring, and summer and autumn precipitation levels in the regions where hydro powerplants are located. This means that water can be stored in reservoirs during periods of high inflow (for example, during the spring flood). The reservoirs with the largest volumes are located upstream of the hydropower producing rivers. The large year-round reservoirs enable us to utilize about half of the hydropower produced in Sweden. Instead of being wasted when inflows are very high during spring floods and periods of heavy precipitation, production is saved for a later time, when the demand for electricity rises. 
Balancing power for a balanced electricity system 
The distinguishing features of hydropower are that it is renewable and easy to regulate. This means that it can quickly adapt production as demand fluctuates. These fluctuations may pertain to slower changes that are impacted by, for example, the season and economic cycles. They may also pertain to rapid changes that are linked to society’s activities at different times of the day. The balancing capacity of hydropower is a prerequisite to, for example, solar and wind power, which must be compensated for when the weather is unfavorable. 
Nature’s own eco cycle 
Heat from the sun causes water from the ground, lakes, rivers and seas to evaporate and rise. As the air cools at higher altitudes, the evaporated water condenses to form clouds that then lead to precipitation in the form of rain or snow. Most evaporation occurs in southern Sweden, while the most precipitation occurs in the Scandes mountain range, in the form of snow. The snow melts during spring and drains into the watercourses, and some of this water is collected in the reservoirs to be used for generating power, primarily during the subsequent winter period. The entire process is repeated year after year with some variation in precipitation levels – referred to as dry years, normal years and wet years. 
History of hydropower 
Harnessing the potential energy of flowing water to generate electricity is an old and proven technique that stretches a long way back in time. As early as in times of antiquity, water wheels were used to perform mechanical tasks. 
The first hydropower facility had already been built in Sweden by the 12th century. The 13th century Land Code in Äldre Västgötalagen (old Westrogothic law) comprises a section with the heading, “Huru miulna skal gaerea” (How mills shall be built). 
However, it was not until the 19th century that hydropower began to be used for large-scale electricity generation, which essentially jump-started Sweden’s industrialization.  
In the early 1900s, the first hydropower association was formed and, shortly thereafter, the Swedish Parliament passed a series of resolutions that enabled further expansion and collaboration. It was only in the 1940s that major river developments gained momentum, with major projects by the rivers: Indalsälven, Ångermanälven and Faxälven. The foundations where thereby laid for the Swedish welfare state. 
Dam safety – leaving nothing to chance 
We own and are responsible for approximately 100 hydropower dams in Sweden. Our entire operations are based on a well-functioning dam-safety system. We are responsible for the consequences of a dam collapse and therefore invest significant resources in the maintenance and inspection of our dams. We utilize systems that monitor water surfaces, temperature and movement, as well as inspections by trained personnel who perform everything from weekly rounds to FDUs (Eng: In-depth Dam Safety Assessments). This is the most qualified step in our dam safety work, when supervisory authorities and external experts participate in thorough analysis of dam safety. 
The energy industry has jointly developed a compendium of rules and guidelines for dam safety work known as RIDAS (Eng: Swedish Dam Safety Guidelines) together with associated guidelines. Svenska kraftnät and the county administrative boards are the supervisory authorities that ensure that dam safety is managed correctly. A crucial aspect of the dam safety work is based on ensuring our capacity to manage the water, even at really high flows. In concrete terms, this entails that we, for example, build extra spillways in our dams or rebuild those that already exist, in order to cope with major water flows. 
Reservoir levels impact prices 
The water added by the melting spring snow and from annual precipitation can be stored in large reservoirs along the rivers. This allows the water to be saved for electricity generation during periods of the year when electricity is in highest demand. The dispatchability of hydropower is highly beneficial to the Swedish electricity system. 
Consequently, it is important to monitor reservoir levels, which is done continuously via the website of the Nordic electricity exchange, Nord Pool. Access to water is one of many factors that impact both short- and long-term electricity prices. Well-filled reservoirs usually entail a lower average electricity price, while dry years with little precipitation can cause electricity prices to be higher than in normal years.

Advantages of hydropower
Hydropower has many advantages. It has near-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, while providing a reliable electricity supply at a competitive price. Hydropower is renewable, because the water that is utilized by the powerplant is not consumed, but constantly returned in the form of precipitation.
Image
Hydropower and the environment
All electricity and energy production impacts the environment. When it comes to hydropower, powerplants and dams involve an encroachment on the environment that changes the conditions of life in and adjacent to watercourses.
Image
Balancing power – matching electricity supply and timing to loads
We are seeing rising demand for electricity as society develops and new innovations see the light of day. Consequently, balancing power becomes increasingly important, the more solar and wind power we utilize in the electricity system.

Hydropower Draws Bipartisan Support as Renewable Energy Source
Drought, maintenance costs hinder energy’s capacity
Lawmakers seek to provide greater hydropower incentives to industry
January 11, 2022 2:26 PM

Drought, expensive facility upgrades, and a slow permitting process threaten the country’s ability to harness and expand hydropower to generate electricity, witnesses and lawmakers agreed at a Senate hearing that sought solutions to overcome the challenges.
Democrats and Republicans both view hydropower as a unique and valuable renewable energy because it provides baseload electricity and can repower grids that collapse—an increasing concern after last winter’s devastating power outage in Texas. Hydropower provided 7.3% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2020, most of it generated at federal dams operated by the Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation. It’s a critical complement to other forms of renewable energy, but advocates say it lacks significant federal incentives for investors and industry that alternative sources like wind and solar enjoy.
“I think we have taken it for granted for far too long on hydropower, and really paying attention to it and developing it the way it should be developed,” said Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) during Tuesday’s hearing.
The bipartisan infrastructure law (Public Law 117-58) invests more than $750 million for new and existing incentives—including tax credits—for hydropower production and improvements. It also provides $8.2 billion to the Bureau of Reclamation for western water infrastructure, including upgrades.
Bipartisan Appeal
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to do more to make the energy source more attractive to investors and operators through greater incentives and a less burdensome licensing process.
Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) are co-sponsoring legislation (S. 2306) that would create new federal tax incentives to promote environmental grid resiliency upgrades for hydropower dams. Murkowski on Tuesday said she hopes the bill will move this Congress. “I think that will be a big step forward.”
Montana Sens. Steve Daines (R) and Jon Tester (D) along with Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) on Monday introduced legislation (S. 3450) to authorize hydropower for the Sun River Project, including the Gibson Dam, in the state. Hydropower provides nearly half of all the electricity in Montana, Daines said.
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) on Tuesday told Cantwell he is interested in working with her on streamlining the federal re-licensing process. Hydropower has been “a good source of power” in Oklahoma, which has 10 facilities, but the re-licensing process has been a challenge, he said. Other federal agencies don’t always follow permitting and re-licensing guidelines by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, drawing out the process, Lankford said.
Maintenance upgrades and retrofits at non-federally operated facilities, necessary to remain in line with FERC, are expensive. Nearly 300 facilities are up for federal re-licensing before 2030, which requires them to meet certain federal standards that cost money to implement. “There’s a real possibility that many of these plants could face closure,” said Manchin.
Industry interest is high in hydropower, said Malcolm Woolf, president and chief executive officer of the National Hydropower Association, but the “crazy” permitting process is a deterrent. He said there needs to be greater “process discipline” to make sure agencies honor FERC deadlines and rein in “agency overrun” related to non-germane projects that get tacked onto hydropower initiatives. Woolf said NHA and other groups would submit to Congress next month recommended reforms to the Federal Power Act.
Just 3% of the country’s 80,000 dams currently generate electricity, meaning there’s an untapped opportunity to get non-powered dams, including Montana’s Gibson Dam, to produce energy, said Woolf.
Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said expediting the permitting and licensing processes for those dams that don’t involve environmental issues could be one way of expanding hydropower. One of the major environmental concerns related to dams, which are essential to hydropower, is how they impact fisheries because they disrupt the natural flow of water.
Drought Concerns
The record low water levels in the Colorado River as well as Lake Mead has “immediate impacts on hydropower production,” said Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton during the hearing.
A multi-state partnership in the West, known as the 500+ plan, would conserve and store water to Lake Mead across the Lower Colorado River Basin. That plan, which received funding in the infrastructure law, ultimately will benefit hydropower production, Touton said.
Touton told Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) that all the partners and users agree on the plan’s water conservation goals, and “we are ready to work.”
She added that the federal government and the participating states have committed significant financial resources. “The Bureau of Reclamation has already found the $50 million of $100 million of the cost-share that we have with the states and the states have gone to their boards and brought those monies to bear as well.”

Abstract
Perspectives on the Environmental Implications of Sustainable Hydropower gathers scientific papers from three of the worlds most important hydropower producers to discuss aspects of sustainable hydropower and the means by which it can be studied and achieved. The papers examine the application and use of new technologies and protocols for studying hydropower, adaptive management and the implications and use of long-term data sets for minimizing hydropower impacts on fish populations. The papers include a cross section of biological and hydrological experts. The implicit among country comparisons highlight a number of common hydropower themes, particularly the need to expand from single species studies to include broader consideration of the ecosystem, the importance of maintaining habitat, trait and species diversity and the need for consistently collected long-term data sets.

Question
Give your opinion about whether hydroelectric plants are environment friendly or not?
Solution
Environment friendly are the things that don’t cause any harm to nature and our surroundings, and Hydroelectric power plants also are eco-friendly.
Hydroelectric power plants use energy from the water, which doesn’t produce any waste products or harmful gases into the atmosphere when power is generated.
Water is a natural resource that is available in plenty on Earth and is a renewable source also. So, it is quite certain that this energy source is not dying out.
These Hydroelectric power plants are eco-friendly as they provide a clean, renewable, and efficient form of energy.

In a *sense* it is done all the time. Some power *grids* have both nuclear & hydroelectric power plants providing electricity. This has the advantage of the nuclear plant running steadily & the hydro plant covering the variability of electricity demand.
You can look at what provides electricity to a lot of regions in the world with this webpage
Live 24/7 CO₂ emissions of electricity consumption
Electricity Maps is a live 24/7 visualization of where your electricity comes from and how much CO2 was emitted to produce it.
https://app.electricitymaps.com/map
Click on a region that isn’t grey and it shows the power supply in a sub-page to the left of the map.
Eg: Ontario, Finland, and Sweden all have substantial amounts of both nuclear & hydro.

Did Harry inherit more than William?
Yes and no. When the Queen mother died back in 2002 she left more money to Harry, knowing that William would eventually become Prince and inherit the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate valued at over $1 billion.
Which is exactly what happened when Queen Elizabeth passed away in 2022. So overall, Willian inherited quite a bit more than Harry.
But this $1 billion estate is nothing compared to the $10 billion that King Charles received tax free, thanks to a clever investment by the Queen into one of the world’s most exclusive asset classes … fine art.
The Royal family has been investing a portion o

I’ve never heard of one, but as a lay person I can imagine it. Hydroelectric power could be used for emergency cooling of the waste pool and to enable a black start. Diesel is usually used for this. Such a plant wouldn’t necessarily put power from the hydroelectric system on the grid since the nuclear part, unless small reactors take off, is likely to generate much more. The main issue I see that would prevent this is that buying diesel generators might be much cheaper than building a hydrielectric plant and their may be no suitable sites for doing that.
Also, although it may not be at the same

Sure. I would argue it currently exists. Put a pond on top of a mountain. During the night, pump water to the top of the mountain to store in the pond. Power use at night is lower than during the day.
During the day, drain water from the pond to the basin below running the pump as a turbine. Power use during the day is higher than at night.
Your nuclear power plant is baseloaded at 100%. Your pumped storage is for peak load support.

I imagine it would be possible. One uses kinetic energy to drive a turbine and one uses steam to drive a turbine.
They’re both quite different in construction and buildings design.
No reason why not except the onvious question, why?
If you have access to kinetic water flow use that. If not use nuclear. Having the two types together makes safety, design and maintenance overly complicated for no advantages.

How Hydropower Works
Types of Hydropower Turbines
Glossary of Hydropower Terms
There are three types of hydropower facilities: impoundment, diversion, and pumped storage. Some hydropower plants use dams and some do not.
Although not all dams were built for hydropower, they have proven useful for pumping tons of renewable energy to the grid. In the United States, there are more than 90,000 dams, of which less than 2,300 produce power as of 2020. The other dams are used for recreation, stock/farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.
Hydropower plants range in size from small systems suitable for a single home or village to large projects producing electricity for utilities. Learn more about the sizes of hydropower plants.
IMPOUNDMENT
The most common type of hydroelectric power plant is an impoundment facility. An impoundment facility, typically a large hydropower system, uses a dam to store river water in a reservoir. Water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity. The water may be released to meet changing electricity needs or other needs, such as flood control, recreation, fish passage, and other environmental and water quality needs.
DIVERSION
A diversion, sometimes called a “run-of-river” facility, channels a portion of a river through a canal and/or a penstock to utilize the natural decline of the river bed elevation to produce energy. A penstock is a closed conduit that channels the flow of water to turbines with water flow regulated by gates, valves, and turbines. A diversion may not require the use of a dam.
PUMPED STORAGE
Another type of hydropower, called pumped storage hydropower, or PSH, works like a giant battery. A PSH facility is able to store the electricity generated by other power sources, like solar, wind, and nuclear, for later use. These facilities store energy by pumping water from a reservoir at a lower elevation to a reservoir at a higher elevation.
When the demand for electricity is low, a PSH facility stores energy by pumping water from the lower reservoir to an upper reservoir. During periods of high electrical demand, the water is released back to the lower reservoir and turns a turbine, generating electricity. 
SIZES OF HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS
Hydropower facilities range in size from large power plants, which supply many consumers with electricity, to small and even ‘micro’ plants, which are operated by individuals for their own energy needs or to sell power to utilities.
Large Hydropower
Although definitions vary, DOE defines large hydropower plants as facilities that have a capacity of more than 30 megawatts (MW).
Small Hydropower
Although definitions vary, DOE defines small hydropower plants as projects that generate between 100 kilowatts and 10 MW.
Micro Hydropower
A micro hydropower plant has a capacity of up to 100 kilowatts. A small or micro hydroelectric power system can produce enough electricity for a single home, farm, ranch, or village.

BACKGROUND: Environmental impact statement
After years of efforts by special interest groups to breach the Snake River dams in Washington, a final environmental impact statement (EIS) was released by federal agencies on July 31, 2020. The preferred alternative recommended the four Lower Snake River dams – Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite – remain in place.
The EIS investigated how 14 dams in the Columbia River System Operations (CRSO) affect fish survival. It also considered how removing or altering the Lower Snake River dams would affect social and economic changes, including irrigation, barging and power generation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) received nearly 59,000 comments on the draft EIS before the plan was completed.
In the final analysis, the study concluded that while “breaching of the Lower Snake River projects would have major long-term beneficial effects to resident fish in the Snake River,” it would also threaten the state’s energy grid reliability and “has the highest adverse impacts to other resources, especially social and economic effects.”
Why are the Snake/Columbia River dams important?
ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION
The EIS said the dams play an important role in maintaining reliability in the carbon-free production of power used to supply baseload generation across the Pacific Northwest. Nearly 60% of energy produced in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana comes from hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers, which generate carbon-free electricity.
Breaching the dams would decrease hydropower generation by nearly 1,000 megawatts. The dams also supply nearly a quarter of the region’s power reserves holding capacity and provide needed power when intermittent sources, such as wind and solar, cannot. This is important because demands for electrical generation can happen instantaneously – especially in winter months.
The report said dam removal would require building significant quantities of replacement resources to maintain regional power reliability. The EIS cautioned if the dams are removed, “the region would face the likelihood of a loss of load event, e.g., a power blackout, nearly one in every seven years.” Plus, electricity rates could increase as much as 25%.
During the record heatwave of June 2021, BPA credited its Ice Harbor Dam with preventing power outages and rolling blackouts in the Tri-Cities. Without all four of the lower Snake River dams in Eastern Washington, BPA says powering through the heatwave would have been much more expensive and challenging.
NAVIGATION
The federal study also says breaching the dams would have major adverse effects on transportation. Each Snake River dam has a navigational lock that allows inland farmers access to international markets. More than 3.9 million tons of cargo was barged on the Snake River in 2019. More than 40,000 local jobs are dependent on this trade, with more than $21 billion in cargo value.
The Snake River is particularly important to Northwest wheat farmers. Each year, the dams make it possible for nearly 40% of all U.S. wheat exports to move in the most fuel-efficient, safest, lowest emission type of cargo transportation – barging.
IRRIGATION FOR AGRICULTURE
The EIS noted that if the dams were breached, ground water elevations would drop up to 100 feet in some areas. Farmers who pump water could lose the ability to irrigate nearly 48,000 acres, leading to millions of dollars in lost income and agricultural output.
Why do breaching efforts continue despite agreements?
Biological opinion supports leaving dams in place
The federal agencies did recommend more spill over several dams to help juvenile fish migrate to the Pacific Ocean. A 2019 agreement allows for flexible spills that balance needs of fish and hydropower.
When the final EIS was released, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) completed its “biological opinion” or “BiOp” plan for endangered salmon. It too supported leaving the dams in place.

Agreements reached
On Sept. 28, 2020, the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation and BPA signed a joint Record of Decision (ROD) which commits the agencies to implementing immediate and long-term actions related to the ongoing operations, maintenance, and configuration of 14 federal dams that compose the Columbia River System, including the four Lower Snake River dams. The ROD supports a balance of dam operations and ongoing and new improvements for endangered species.
Surprisingly, environmental and river conservation organizations and the U.S. hydropower industry announced in October 2020 an agreement on the coexistence of dams and environmental concerns. The parties agreed to work together to address a range of challenges, including licensing/relicensing, dam safety, and advancing renewable energy and storage benefits of hydropower and economic benefits of healthy rivers.
Simultaneously, the governors of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana announced the creation of a four-state collaborative process to restore a healthy salmon population, without adversely impacting affordable electricity and local economies.
Lawsuits seek to unravel EIS agreement
After Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed this four-state collaborative agreement, she filed a lawsuit over the federal government’s management of the four lower Snake River dams. The suit calls for injunctive relief, including 24-hour maximum spillovers at all eight Columbia and Snake River dams. One Oregon electric cooperative said, “through her actions, the governor dismissed the EIS before giving it a chance.” Washington Reps. Dan Newhouse and Cathy McMorris Rodgers added, “Tossing what was billed as a collaborative process aside to pursue yet another obstructive lawsuit means abandoning the hard work necessary to recover salmon.”
Other opponents unwilling to accept the EIS’s preferred alternative are also suing. In January 2021, Earthrise Law Center, working with Earthjustice, an environmental law organization based in San Francisco, California, filed a supplemental complaint with the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, alleging the EIS, the BiOp, and the joint ROD, violate the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The plaintiffs hope to force the federal government to reconsider recommendations against breaching the Lower Snake River dams.
Dam breaching efforts continue
In February 2021, Idaho Republican Congressman Mike Simpson released a $33 billion proposal that would authorize removal of the four dams, provide funds to shippers and farmers for alternatives to barge shipping, remove the port in Lewiston, Idaho, provide economic development money to Lewiston and the Tri-Cities, and ban litigation over the four Columbia River dams for 35 years. No funding, however, was contained in the federal infrastructure bill for Simpson’s proposal.
In Oct. 2021, Gov. Jay Inslee and Washington’s U.S. Sen. Patty Murray announced they will begin a process to restore salmon runs in the state, including an in-depth study of potentially replacing the four Lower Snake River dams. They say the details on the state and federal plan have been in the works since May 2021, after Congressman Simpson released his dam breaching plan. Inslee and Murray say they engage in outreach to communities across the Pacific Northwest to solicit their views, including tribes, and will finalize their recommendations to Congress by July 31, 2022.

What about environmental concerns?
Dam removal won’t save orcas
Southern Resident orcas spend most of their time in the coastal inland waters of the Salish Sea. As a result, a NOAA Fisheries analysis showed that Chinook from the rivers that feed into Salish Sea—not the Columbia or Snake rivers which drain directly into the Pacific Ocean—are the top priority salmon stock for Southern Resident orcas. NOAA asserts salmon losses are largely due to unfavorably warm ocean conditions, adding, “No salmon recovery effort on a single river will bring about recovery of southern resident killer whales on its own.”
The myth against dams is busted: Salmon runs have risen
For the second year in a row, the Snake River Spring Chinook salmon run has increased with more than 29,634 salmon passing the Lower Granite Dam. That’s a 27% increase from 2020 levels and 55% larger than 2019 returns. This is in sharp contrast to predictions made by dam opponents in June. Reps. Newhouse and McMorris Rodgers said in a joint statement, “Despite radical environmental groups trying to paint a dire picture of extinction, Spring Chinook returns are trending in the right direction for a second year in a row, providing what we already know: dams and salmon can – and do – coexist.”
Where do we go from here?
SOLUTIONS: Alternatives to dam breaching and increasing salmon runs
There are more effective ways to restoring and preserving Northwest salmon:
Fix the Puget Sound wastewater disposal and industrial runoff problem
The Department of Ecology says excess nutrients from domestic wastewater treatment plants are stressing aquatic life in the Puget Sound. Many parts of Puget Sound have oxygen levels below what marine life needs to thrive. The Sound is considered an “impaired” water body, not meeting water quality levels. Millions of gallons of untreated stormwater and raw sewage have been repeatedly spilled into Puget Sound from municipal wastewater treatment plants in Seattle and along the Sound’s coastline during rainfall. These spills are an enormous threat to salmon, public health, and the environment. Shockingly, the Washington Department of Ecology recently proposed a new general pollution permit that would allow 58 sewage treatment plants to continue to pollute Puget Sound and jeopardize salmon stocks. In 2021, 10 Puget Sound area beaches were closed due to fecal contamination after a sewage spill.
Address urban heat island issues that create warm water discharges
Salmon thrive in cool waters and are stressed by warm water. Urban heat islands along the Puget Sound can warm salmon-bearing streams and rivers. Urban heat islands occur when cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. Coastal cities, such as Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, heat the atmosphere – not from carbon – but from city heat absorption. Seattle can be up to 17 degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas in the summer. Waterways are impacted from warm stormwater runoff, and this affects critical habitat for salmon. One solution is Rep. Mary Dye’s House Bill 1114, which provide incentives to use heat reflective materials, plant trees and enact practices that would cool our cities and significantly reduce the impacts to our environment. This bill passed the Legislature during the 2021 session and is now law.
Pass House Bill 1211 concerning salmon-safe communities
This bill from Rep. Mary Dye, R-Pomeroy, would utilize the existing framework of general municipal stormwater permits for better reporting of issues that could affect salmon habitat. The measure also provides for awards to communities that monitor, report, and mitigate issues that would lead toward measurable gains toward salmon recovery.
Rely on proven scientific solutions
We need to ensure cost-effective, science-based policy approaches to the region’s largest wildlife recovery effort. This includes tributary and estuary habitat restoration, actions to reduce toxic pollutants, predator management, research into the impacts of ocean conditions on the life cycle, enhanced hatcheries management, fisheries oversight, and research on the reintroduction of salmon above the Hells Canyon Complex in Idaho.
Bonneville Dam on Columbia River
CONCLUSION: Salmon are important. People are too!
We all recognize the importance of salmon to the Pacific Northwest. These fish are vital to the ecosystem of our region and the food chain in our rivers, and waterways throughout Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean.
Salmon have also been a part of the Pacific Northwest culture for thousands of years, as well as the economies of the region from ancient Indian trade routes to modern commercial fishing. Preserving our salmon populations is vital to our way of life. No one wishes to see this change. However, salmon preservation must be accomplished using solid scientific data and proven evidence, not emotional anecdotes, such as promoting breaching of dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers, which would be devastating to other vital segments of Pacific Northwest economies and livelihoods.
As House Environment and Energy Committee ranking member Rep. Mary Dye noted: “We have now had a legitimate, transparent, and scientifically rigorous process to develop an Environmental Impact Statement. The Army Corps, the Bureau of Reclamation, and NOAA Fisheries have agreed on a preferred path to manage the Columbia River System in a way that balances the interests in salmon survival, food production and trade, clean power generation, and recreation. The time has come for pragmatism, cooperation and coordination and to reject radical plans with all the uncertainty they entail.”
The four-year EIS study recognizes dams and salmon are important to our socio-economic way of life and can coexist. With proper management of the dams, salmon, and the ecosystem across the state, we can have both – salmon can thrive in our waterways and Washingtonians can continue to have the benefits provided by our Snake and Columbia river dams.

I am putting an effort to move past the apparent silliness of the question and assuming there is a clever angle to it.
One might think, any power source that’s not using a turbine that’s utilizing force of water to move it and generating the electricity can be considered a non hydroelectric power. Right?
Right and that should eliminate everything except the large hydro electric projects and the smal

Did Harry inherit more than William?
Yes and no. When the Queen mother died back in 2002 she left more money to Harry, knowing that William would eventually become Prince and inherit the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate valued at over $1 billion.
Which is exactly what happened when Queen Elizabeth passed away in 2022. So overall, Willian inherited quite a bit more than Harry.
But this $1 billion estate is nothing compared to the $10 billion that King Charles received tax free, thanks to a clever investment by the Queen into one of the world’s most exclusive asset classes … fine art.
The Royal family has been investing a portion o

What are some examples of hydroelectric energy?
The 50 largest single location electricity stations in the world are hydroelectric dams.
Every time you have a big river that goes down say 100 meters / 300 ft over a few hundred Km / miles, you have massive energy going to waste as it goes down.
We then build a large reservoir that bottles up that water and concentrates the fall in a single location. Its not a classic fall you can see, but just a big orifice at the bottom of the dam. The water on top of it creates a big water column pressure and large volumes flow. It goes into a turbine that directly converts water flow into a spinning shaft i

DROUGHT ALERT - Conditions continue to degrade with 85% of the state experiencing abnormally dry conditions.

Hydroelectric
Hydropower uses the natural energy of moving water, in rivers to spin turbines that generate electricity. Pumped storage, another type of hydropower technology, can store energy generated by other power sources for later use. Hydropower emits no air pollution and is renewable energy. 
Below is a list of hydroelectric power plants located in Missouri as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration through Form EIA-860 data.

Diamond Valley Lake
Metropolitan built Diamond Valley Lake as a promise for the future. The vast reservoir, nestled between two hillsides, plays a vital role in how we manage and deliver drinking water. By storing up to six months together with all of our storage accounts of emergency supplies, the reservoir serves as a critical lifeline, helping Southern California get through dry times and catastrophes. It also provides important habitat for plants and animals and popular recreational amenities for the community.
Diamond Valley Lake serves as an indispensable asset, one that reflects Metropolitan’s commitment to water reliability, environmental stewardship, and a climate resilient future for Southern California.
A Lasting Achievement 
Diamond Valley Lake’s story is one of thoughtful planning and foresight. Its construction during the late 1990s marked a bold and historic achievement for Metropolitan. Since then, the reservoir has been instrumental in carrying us through challenging water scenarios, including several multi-year droughts. The reservoir was built to hold enough water to serve nearly 2.4 million Southern California families for a year. It stores up to 810,000 acre-feet of water (264 billion gallons), nearly doubling the region’s prior surface water storage capacity when it became operational.  
Greater System Flexibility
Water stored in DVL travels from Northern California through the State Water Project and its 444-mile California Aqueduct before being delivered to the reservoir through the Inland Feeder and the Eastside Pipeline. Stored water can be routed to almost all of Metropolitan’s service area if needed during a drought or an emergency.
A Purposeful Location
The reservoir is in the city of Hemet in southwest Riverside County, about 90 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The search for the reservoir site spanned four years and consideration of 13 sites before leaders decided on the hourglass-shaped Diamond and Domenigoni valleys. The location was chosen for its elevation allowing for gravity flows, clean hydroelectric power opportunities, water quality improvements, and proximity to Metropolitan's existing water delivery system. DVL is 4.5 miles long and
2 miles wide and has depths of up to 250 feet.  
Environmental Benefits  

The reservoir is home to natural habitat areas that protect wildlife and ecosystems. Two large nature reserves nearby provide a model for how infrastructure can be built in harmony with nature. The reservoir’s development marked a significant precedent for public/private partnerships and raised environmental protection to a new level by focusing on entire ecosystems rather than individual habitats.
Read more about Metropolitan Multi-species Habitat Preservation and Protection Program. 
Southwestern Riverside County Multi-Species Reserve

About 14,000 acres of open space have been preserved within the Southwestern Riverside County Multi-Species Reserve surrounding and connecting Diamond Valley Lake with Lake Skinner. 
With creation of the reserve, Metropolitan helped forge California's first agreement for multi-species protection.  
The reserve is home to at least eight types of habitat and many sensitive bird, animal and plant species.  
The reserve contains more than 30 miles of biking, hiking and equestrian trails.  
Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve 
  The Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve contains some of Southern California's last vernal pools that support fairy shrimp, wintering waterfowl and spring wildflowers.  
Metropolitan joined Riverside County, the California Wildlife Conservation Board and the Nature Conservancy to purchase and protect 6,800 acres.  
The effort helped preserve valuable lands while also securing approvals to develop Diamond Valley Lake to help forge a dependable water supply for Southern California. 
The reserve has a network of multi-use trails, a comprehensive interpretative program, and a visitor center. Click here for more information. 
Recreational Opportunities & Challenges
Diamond Valley Lake provides high-quality recreational opportunities that allow for the continued protection of our drinking water supply and function in harmony with the natural environment. There are an array of recreational opportunities including boating, fishing, canoeing, kayaking and sailing, as well as adjacent multi-purpose trails, bike paths, and public park facilities. Amenities include 2.5 miles of shoreline fishing, a marina and concession area, and park facilities. 
Check here for more general information about the marina and recreation.  
On the Water
The reservoir provides boating, fishing, kayaking, canoeing and sailing opportunities. Boating and fishing are available year-round. To support the reservoir’s recreational values and protect drinking water quality, Metropolitan established rules and regulations for visitors, recreational users, and boaters at Diamond Valley Lake. Body contact (such as swimming, water skiing and use of personal watercraft) is prohibited. Boats are required to have clean-burning engines that use direct fuel injection. Visitors are responsible for knowing and complying with all California Division of Boating and Waterways and Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations.
Check here for a full list of boating rules, requirements and rental information.
Invasive Species Challenge
One of the greatest concerns for both water quality and system operations is the spread of invasive quagga mussels. The mussels, which are spread by commercial ships and recreational boats, can multiply rapidly, clog pipes and pumping machinery, and ruin the ecology of lakes and reservoirs. Once the lake ecology is altered, the growth of algae can occur and affect the taste of a region’s drinking water. The mussels have been found along the Colorado River at Lake Havasu, Lake Mead and Lake Mohave. They have not been found at DVL. To prevent their spread, boats visiting DVL have launch requirements and craft operators will be interviewed to insure requirements listed here have been followed.
Check here for additional quagga reference material. The California Department of Fish and Game offers additional resources here.
Visitor Information
Diamond Valley Lake Marina
Located at the eastern end of the lake, the marina and concession area offer boat rentals and fishing supplies. Check here for more information. Click here for hours and fees.

Construction Notables
The construction of DVL’s Don Owen West dam, Carl Boronkay East dam and Saddle dams represented one of the largest earthwork projects in the nation. It took place between 1995 and 2000 and involved a foundation excavation of more than 40 million cubic yards of earth and 110 million cubic yards for embankment construction. A literal mountain of rock was moved from the south rim of the reservoir and placed across the valley floor to form two dams, one 2.1 miles long, the other 1.5 miles long, at each end of the 4.5 mile valley. Materials for the earth-core rock fill dams were all sourced within the project boundary. There were two rock processing plants set up for the project and together, their production exceeded the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. The construction equipment used — shovels, loaders and trucks — were the largest available in the industry and set a new standard for earth and rock movement.
 
Making & Preserving History
Development of DVL was grounded in our commitment to serving customers and protecting the environment. Along the way came remarkable historical discoveries. For seven years, two-person paleontology teams worked at opposite ends of the valley for 10-hour shifts, 20-hour days, six days a week, following massive earth-moving equipment. They would find, what many experts consider, a collection of fossils to rival the famous La Brea Tar Pits.  The area was called, “The Valley of the Mastodons.” One of the more famous discoveries was Max the Mastodon. More than two decades after the discovery, it was determined that Max was the first new mastodon species named in more than 50 years from North America (Mammut pacificus, the Pacific mastodon). During excavation, bones and skeletons were found from extinct mastodons and also mammoth, camel, sloth, dire wolf and long-horned bison.

Read DVL: At A Glance fact sheet 
Western Science Center
These archeological discoveries inspired the opening of the Western Science Center in 2006. It holds archaeological and paleontological finds from the valley’s human inhabitants and more than one million prehistoric fossils.

Nestled high in California’s Sierra Nevada, the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project

generates clean and efficient hydropower, as it has for more than a century. The project’s intricate system of nine powerhouses, six reservoirs and 27 dams was the most complex and technologically advanced hydro plant of the early 20th century. Today, it continues to generate about 1,000 megawatts of clean energy, representing an integral part of Southern California Edison’s Pathway 2045
- Opens in new window
electrification and decarbonization initiative.

“The need for clean energy in the state of California has never been greater as we move to a future that will require it,” said Dan Golden, SCE principal manager of Generation at Big Creek. “While we continue to be challenged with droughts across the state, we have and will continue to develop infrastructure that will better enable the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project to deliver clean energy when our customers need it the most.”

The industry’s earliest engineers built Big Creek to meet the growing needs of a community that was quickly developing 280 miles to the south: the sprawling city of Los Angeles. It did that — and more.
October 1921: The completed Powerhouse 8.
With the addition of Powerhouse 8 — known as the “90-Day Wonder” after being built in an inconceivable 90 days — 100 years ago, the Big Creek system surpassed the capabilities of hydropower generation of its time, transforming the state we know today. Most significantly, Powerhouse 8 was the first plant designed to transmit commercial power at 220 kilovolts — a technological achievement the world had never seen.

“Engineering-wise, they were breaking transmission records,” said Audry Williams, historian with SCE’s Biology and Archeology Resources department. “When Powerhouse 8 came online, they were able to increase to the highest-voltage level in history and transmit power with the longest distance transmission lines.”

In addition to powering energy generation, Big Creek has been a lifeline for countless communities in the Central Valley. In partnership with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
- Opens in new window
, the system helps facilitate the delivery of water from the Sierra Nevada watershed directly to homes, farms and businesses.
Dam 6 just below Powerhouse 8 continues to provide clean energy and water for California.
“The SCE team have been wonderful partners in working collaboratively with Reclamation,” said Michael P. Jackson, area manager with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. “Big Creek has provided water customers in the Central Valley with the benefits of flood protection, water supply and power production that supports everything water-related in the Central Valley.”

A lesser known, but more direct, result of Big Creek can be seen in the town of Big Creek, itself. Originally a remote, inaccessible area of the Sierra Nevada, the community developed during the construction of the hydroelectric project to support workers and their families. Many current Big Creek residents can trace their family history to Big Creek’s original staffers, and it’s a legacy they’re proud to uphold.
October 1921: A DC switchboard operator at Powerhouse 8.
“Mountain communities share a lot of pride and we’ve shared a lot through the years,” said Anne Walzberg, staff member with Camp Sierra
- Opens in new window
, a seasonal recreation camp and Big Creek’s closest neighbor. “A lot of the kids that have grown up at Big Creek have actually worked at Camp Sierra, so we share that history.”

Because Big Creek’s services helped shape the history of California, the project earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. But unlike other historic districts and landmarks, Big Creek is not a relic of the past. It remains dedicated to providing clean energy and much-needed water for decades to come.

Libreville, Gabon, July 2, 2021 – Gabon Power Company (GPC), a portfolio company of the Gabonese Strategic Investment Fund (FGIS), and Meridiam, an independent investment Benefit Corporation specialised in the development, financing and long-term management of sustainable public infrastructures, have signed an agreement for the financing of the Kinguélé Aval hydroelectric power plant.
Located 100 km east of Libreville on the Mbei River, bordering the Crystal Mountains National Park, the new facility will have a capacity of 35 MW. The plant is expected to supply the national network up to 205 GWh per year including 13% of the electrical needs of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. It will lead to the replacement of existing thermal capacity and will save more than 150,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. It will also benefit the electrification of rural areas such as Andock Foula, contributing to social inclusion in Gabon.
The purchase of construction equipment and materials from Gabonese companies will be favoured, thus supporting the diversification, development and economic recovery of the country. During the construction period, 800 direct jobs will be created on the site. Later on, during the operation phase, twenty Gabonese professionals will be responsible for running the hydroelectric plant. It is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2024.
The total funding required to build the dam amounts to €179 million, under a 30-year concession agreement. Kinguélé Aval is carried by Asonha Energie, a project company owned 60% by Meridiam and 40% by GPC, and is supported by several major financing institutions: IFC, the World Bank’s private sector, the African Development Bank, the Development Bank of Southern Africa and the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund.
""The financing of this project is excellent news for Gabon.""
Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nzé
Minister of State and Minister of Energy and Hydraulic Resources
The implementation of the dam was the subject of in-depth preliminary studies, in order to mitigate its environmental and social impact. Asonha Energie has especially developed an action plan designed to generate biodiversity net gains, based on the “avoid-reduce-restore-compensate” method. This plan is carried out in close collaboration with the National Agency for the Protection of Nature (ANPN) and the Ministry of Water, Forests, Sea and Environment.
This project directly contributes to some United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs): building a resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization that benefits all and foster innovation (SDG 9); provide affordable and clean energy (SDG7), and promotion of decent work and economic growth for all (SDG8).
Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nzé, Minister of State and Minister of Energy and Hydraulic Resources, declared: “The financing of this project is excellent news for Gabon. The mobilisation of these stakeholders is an incentive for other African and international partners: Gabon is presenting structuring projects with a strong social impact. As an essential component of the Transformation Acceleration Plan set out by the President of the Republic, His Excellency Ali BONGO ONDIMBA, the Kinguélé Aval hydroelectric power plant will reduce the price of energy supply and contribute to Gabon’s economic development.”
Marcellin Massila Akendengue, Managing Director of Gabon Power Company, stated: “As a 40% shareholder in this project, Gabon Power Company actively represents the interests of the Gabonese Strategic Investment Fund and the Gabonese population. This innovative public-private partnership is a significant step forward in providing the utility company, ‘Société d’Énergie et d’Eau du Gabon’ (SEEG), with the opportunity to cover all the energy needs of Estuaire province’s network, through a competitive, sustainable and job-creating offer.”
Mathieu Peller, COO Africa for Meridiam, added: “The Kinguélé Aval hydroelectric power plant, our third project in Gabon after the Transgabonaise and the Owendo mineral port, is both symbolic and strategic for the country. It is part of our ambition to support Gabon’s economic and social development while contributing to its ecological transition. It is the result of an active and fruitful collaboration with the Gabonese authorities, the Gabon Power Company and the Gabonese Strategic Investment Fund.”

Creating Energy
By Raisa Barrera
Have you ever been to beach and watch the waves crash? Ever visit Great Falls and hear and see the rushing water goes tumble down the rocks? How about turn on your sink and rinse away the soap off your hands? Then you've seen water create energy before! In this NPS article series, you will answer the following questions:
How does water create energy?
How does the Potomac River create energy?
Where are examples of water creating energy throughout the C&O Canal?
Water is all around us! Water is in our homes, comes rushing down when it rains, and even a major part of our National Parks. Together, let's learn how water creates energy.

NAVIGATION
How does water create energy?
Energy from moving water can be used to create electricity in several different ways: a hydroelectric dam, wave power, or tidal power.
Hydroelectric dam: Takes energy from a moving river. The dam controls the flow of water and the amount of electricity that is produced. Dams create large bodies of calm water (or reservoirs) behind them. These bodies of waters can be used for recreation, wildlife sanctuaries, or even sources of drinking water.
Wave power: Takes energy from waves on the surface of the ocean using technology like a special buoy or other floating device.
Tidal power: Takes energy of flowing waters with the help of turbines as tides rush in and out of coastal areas.
Hydropower (or waterpower) uses water to power machinery or make electricity. Water is constantly evaporating from lakes and oceans, forming clouds, precipitating as rain or snow, flowing back into our watersheds, and eventually making its way back to the ocean.

This water cycle is driven by the sun and can be used to produce electricity to power machines, power homes, or help power farms. Hydropower is a renewable energy, since the water cycle is a constant and endless cycle.

The Water Cycle
Hydropower relies on the water cycle. The water cycle has three steps:
Solar energy heats water on the surface of lakes, rivers, and oceans, which causes the water to evaporate.
Water vapor condenses into clouds and falls as precipitation—rain and snow.
Precipitation collects in streams and rivers, which empty into oceans and lakes, where it evaporates and the cycle begins again.

Hydroelectric Dam
This diagram from the Environmental Protection Agency shows the major parts of a hydroelectric dam. Numbers in the diagram correspond with the steps of how it works.
Flowing water turns a water wheel or turbine
A generator attached to the turbine produces electricity
How does the Potomac River create energy?
The Potomac River is a great example of kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the motion of waves, electrons, atoms, molecules, substances, and objects. The Potomac River is an example of motion energy.

Motion energy is stored in the movement of objects. The faster they move, the more energy is stored. It takes energy to get an object moving, and energy is released when an object slows down. A car moving then stopping is an example of motion energy.

The faster the Potomac River is flowing, the more energy is stored. In some parts of the Potomac the river is rushing. This is an example of the river storing energy. Other areas of the Potomac River are slow, and energy has been released.
Illustrated potential and kinetic energy example. A filled balloon is an example of stored energy or potential energy. A balloon losing air releases energy and flies all over a room. This is an example of kinetic energy.

Where are examples of water creating energy throughout the C&O Canal?
A great example of the Potomac River creating energy within the C&O Canal National Historical Park is at Great Falls! The Potomac Gorge is a geological wonder created by thousands of years of rushing water from the Potomac River. The Great Falls are a series of dramatic cascades and waterfalls forced through narrow Mather Gorge as the river drops nearly 80 feet in elevation over less than a mile.

The rushing flowing water stores energy and once the elevation changes energy is released. The water from the Potomac River is still used to fill the C&O Canal today, but in the Canal’s past, was used to help transport raw materials on canal boats up and down river. Today the watered canal provides recreational opportunities and reminder of the historical transportation of America’s past.

Understanding plant lake levels*
The Lake Levels (Elevation in feet Local Datum) represent the level of the lakes at the hydros.
Norway/Lake Shafer FERC operating target
Normal: 645.15 ft
Low-High: 644.90 ft - 645.90
Oakdale/Lake Freeman FERC operating target
Normal: 610.35 ft

Understanding plant discharge levels
The Plant Discharge (cubic feet per second) represents the water flow through each plant.
Flood Emergency: as conditions warrant
Flood Warning: 13,000 Cubic Feet/Second
Flood Watch: 9,000 Cubic Feet/Second
ALF: <=315 Cubic Feet/Second**
* Change in elevation taken near the face of the hydros does not reflect or equate to the same potential change in depth for other areas of the lake. A change of .01 ft in the surface elevation equates to 1/100th of a foot or .12 inches. NIPSCO does not measure average depths.
** An Abnormal Low Flow (ALF) event occurs at the Oakdale Dam when the previous day’s 24-hour average flow at the Buffalo USGS gauge is equal to or less than 260 cfs. During an ALF event, NIPSCO is required to maintain at the Oakdale USGS gauge the lesser of, a) 1.39 times the previous day’s 24-hour average flow measured at the Buffalo USGS gauge or, b) 315 cfs.  This is required by the Operations and Compliance Plan approved by the FERC Order issued March 30, 2023. Lower lake levels could result. An ALF event ends once the 24-hour average rises above 260 cfs at the Buffalo USGS gauge and hourly readings at the Oakdale USGS gauge are above 315 cfs. (This is based on USGS data.)

WHY USE MARINE ENERGY?
Marine energy presents a wide variety of benefits to the communities and stakeholders who may one day use the power source. Marine energy can leverage waves, tides, currents, and differences in water temperature to provide essential power to even the hardest to reach communities. The power source provides a variety of advantages that show why it will play an integral role in achieving U.S. clean energy goals. Listed below are a few significant benefits of marine energy that can help the United States transition to 100% clean electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050.
BENEFITS AND ADVANTAGES OF MARINE ENERGY
Marine energy is a renewable, clean source of energy, only requiring water’s natural movement to generate power.
Marine energy resources are abundant throughout the United States. The country is home to miles of ocean coastline and river resources, posing incredible potential for capitalizing on this resource.
Marine energy is highly predictable(link is external) due to the cyclical nature of waves, tides, and currents.
The predictability of marine energy and its daily and seasonal cycles allow it to complement other energy sources like solar and wind(link is external), whose electricity generation usually dips when waves and tides are most powerful.
Marine energy is a resilient source of energy(link is external). Usually positioned close to where power is needed, marine energy technologies would require short transmission lines, supporting the power grid’s reliability and resilience. 
Marine energy can provide power to remote, coastal, and island communities(link is external). By using the water that surrounds these communities, marine energy can power microgrids that support these communities’ homes and businesses.
Marine energy technologies open the door for other innovations in the maritime sector, such as turning seawater into clean drinking water and powering sea and ocean exploration.
Marine energy has the ability to create jobs(link is external) and provide renewable energy to remote or rural communities. As marine energy technologies are deployed, likely in remote coastal or island communities, the jobs will stay there. Because regardless of where the systems are built, there must be people locally to operate and maintain them.
The marine energy community needs professionals(link is external) contributing to a diverse set of jobs spanning research, policy, environmental science, ecology, engineering, communication, and outreach, and more.
Build real-world, hands-on experience working in the blue economy – a multi-trillion-dollar industry growing at twice the rate of the rest of the global economy.

Hydropower has a crucial role in accelerating clean energy transitions to achieve countries’ climate ambitions securely
Press release
30 June 2021
""Forgotten giant"" of low-carbon electricity needs a sweeping policy and investment push to put it in line with net zero goals and to support a faster expansion of solar and wind, IEA special report shows
The growth of hydropower plants worldwide is set to slow significantly this decade, putting at risk the ambitions of countries across the globe to reach net-zero emissions while ensuring reliable and affordable energy supplies for their citizens, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency.
Hydropower today has a key role in the transition to clean energy not only through the massive quantities of low-carbon electricity it produces but also because of its unmatched capabilities for providing flexibility and storage. Many hydropower plants can ramp their electricity generation up and down very rapidly compared with other power plants such as nuclear, coal and natural gas. This makes sustainable hydropower an attractive foundation for integrating greater amounts of wind and solar power, whose output can vary, depending on factors like the weather and the time of day or year.
Global hydropower capacity is expected to increase by 17% between 2021 and 2030 – led by China, India, Turkey and Ethiopia – according to the Hydropower Special Market Report, part of the IEA’s Renewables market report series. However, the projected growth for the 2020s is nearly 25% slower than hydropower’s expansion in the previous decade.
Reversing the expected slowdown will require a range of strong policy actions from governments to address the major challenges that are hampering faster deployment of hydropower, according to the report. These measures include providing long-term visibility on revenues to ensure hydropower projects are economically viable and sufficiently attractive to investors, while still ensuring robust sustainability standards.
In 2020, hydropower supplied one sixth of global electricity generation, making it the single largest source of low-carbon power – and more than all other renewables combined. Its output has increased 70% over the past two decades, but its share of global electricity supply has held steady because of the increases in wind, solar PV, natural gas and coal. Nonetheless, hydropower currently meets the majority of electricity demand across 28 different emerging and developing economies, which have a total population of 800 million.
“Hydropower is the forgotten giant of clean electricity, and it needs to be put squarely back on the energy and climate agenda if countries are serious about meeting their net zero goals,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director. “It brings valuable scale and flexibility to help electricity systems adjust quickly to shifts in demand and to compensate for fluctuations in supply from other sources. Hydropower’s advantages can make it a natural enabler of secure transitions in many countries as they shift to higher and higher shares of solar and wind – provided that hydropower projects are developed in a sustainable and climate-resilient way.”
The IEA special report is the first study to provide detailed global forecasts to 2030 for the three main types of hydropower: reservoir, run-of-river and pumped storage facilities. Around half of hydropower’s economically viable potential worldwide is untapped, and this potential is particularly high in emerging economies and developing economies, where it reaches almost 60%.
Based on today’s policy settings, China is set to remain the single largest hydropower market through 2030, accounting for 40% of global expansion, followed by India. However, China’s share of global hydropower additions has been declining due to the decreasing availability of economically attractive sites and growing concerns over social and environmental impacts.
Between now and 2030, USD 127 billion – or almost one-quarter of global hydropower investment – is set to be spent on modernising ageing plants, mostly in advanced economies. This is notably the case in North America, where the average age of a hydropower plant is nearly 50 years, and in Europe, where it’s 45 years. Still, the projected investment falls well short of the USD 300 billion that the report estimates is necessary to modernise all ageing hydropower plants worldwide. 
While hydropower remains economically attractive in many regions of the world, the report highlights a number of major challenges it faces. New hydropower projects often face long lead times, lengthy permitting processes, high costs and risks from environmental assessments, and opposition from local communities. These pressures result in higher investment risks and financing costs compared with other power generation and storage technologies, thereby discouraging investors.
The IEA report sets out seven key priorities for governments looking to accelerate the deployment of hydropower in a sustainable way. These include locking in long-term pricing structures and ensuring that hydropower projects adhere to strict guidelines and best practices. This kind of approach can minimise sustainability risks and maximise social, economic and environmental advantages.
If governments address the hurdles to faster deployment appropriately, global hydropower capacity additions could be 40% higher through 2030 by unblocking existing project pipelines, according to the accelerated case presented in the report. But to put the world on a pathway to net-zero emissions by 2050, as set out in the IEA’s recent Global Roadmap to Net Zero by 2050, governments would need to raise their hydropower ambitions drastically. In fact, global hydropower capacity would need to grow twice as fast through 2030 as it is expected to do in the report’s main forecast. A much stronger and all-encompassing policy approach would be required to achieve this.

Why aren't we looking at more hydropower?
Listen with Speechify
Hydropower is already a major source of power globally—it’s the largest source of renewable electricity and one of the fastest growing—but there are limited places to build hydropower, and large dams carry a number of social and environmental concerns.
  March 2, 2021
While wind and solar often dominate conversations about low-carbon electricity, hydropower provides much more electricity worldwide than any other low-carbon energy source—nearly eight times more than solar power and 1.5 times more than nuclear. And it’s one of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy: according to the International Energy Agency, hydro saw more growth between 2008 and 2018 than any other source of renewable electricity other than wind power.1
""If you look at some of the most dramatic proposals for a pathway to zero carbon electricity system, they all need to incorporate a significant build out of hydropower,"" says John Parsons, an energy economist with MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.
However, large hydroelectric dams can’t be built just anywhere. Hydro plants need a consistent supply of water and a large amount of land. Some countries have plenty of these resources; others do not.
Poorly planned hydropower can also cause more problems for the climate than it prevents. Hydro plants need large reservoirs to provide a steady stream of water. When these reservoirs are built, plants and other organic matter get flooded. This material decays over time, releasing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. According to Parsons, there hasn't been much research measuring these emissions, but the studies that have been done have found huge differences from reservoir to reservoir.
""People are right to think of hydro as a low-carbon resource, but the variability is very high and there are some reservoirs that have lifecycle emissions of greenhouse gases that are higher per unit of electricity produced than a fossil plant,"" he says. ""You don't want to just be advocating hydro everywhere.""
Many wealthy countries, including the U.S., have already built out most of their suitable hydro resources. The countries adding large amounts of hydro are mainly growing economies in East Asia and South America. Places like China and Brazil have large planned hydro projects that will come online in the next few years, but rather than replace fossil fuel resources, these dams will be used to expand electricity access to areas that don't have it. These enormous projects generate large amounts of electricity and cost billions of dollars.
""Hydro resources often require a very long-term investment horizon,"" Parsons says. ""When you invest in building out a hydro reservoir, it's usually as a part of a very big economic development strategy over a couple of decades.""
Hydropower can also cause environmental and social problems. Reservoirs drastically change the landscape and rivers they are built on. Dams and reservoirs can reduce river flows, raise water temperature, degrade water quality and cause sediment to build up. This has negative impacts on fish, birds and other wildlife.
These environmental impacts often spill over to humans as well. The World Bank estimated in 2000 that between 40 and 80 million people had been directly displaced by dams and reservoirs.2 Another study from 2010 estimated that 472 million people downstream from large dams suffer from reduced food security, regular flooding or impacts on their livelihood.3
So while hydropower is a good source of low-carbon electricity, even countries with plenty of untapped water need to weigh the benefits of hydro against the environmental and social costs of dam projects. There’s still room for hydro to grow, but most countries will not build out as much hydropower as they theoretically could—and that may be for the best.

By 1900, Atlanta had emerged as a prominent “New South” city. A post-Civil War period economic revival, which included the rebuilding of prosperous railroad lines, led to significant population growth. Important businessmen of Atlanta began to consider hydroelectric power to provide electricity to the growing population and to promote Georgia’s reputation as an economically viable state. The newly-formed Atlanta Water and Electric Power Company began construction on a massive hydroelectric dam in 1902 with Morgan Smith as the primary investor.
The dam, which provided the city’s first source of water-generated electricity, was built on a section of the Chattahoochee River now a reservoir known as Bull Sluice Lake in Sandy Springs, Georgia.  Bull Sluice Lake can be viewed from the Gold Branch unit of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. Completed in 1904, the dam was 1,031 feet long and 56 feet high. Morgan Smith did not live to see the project he had funded completed, but the board of directors of the Atlanta Water and Electric Company named the Morgan Falls Dam facility in his honor. Eventually Morgan Falls Dam became part of the Georgia Power Company. The original generators, though refurbished, are still being used to power metro Atlanta today.
The 1957 construction of Buford Dam greatly altered Morgan Falls Dam. In 1959, sixteen spillway gates were added to the Morgan Falls dam to raise the level of Bull Sluice Lake another six feet and increase the reservoir’s capacity. Other work at Morgan Falls included reinforcing the concrete walls of the dam and overhauling or replacing the old turbines. In 1964 and 1965, the powerhouse was upgraded. When Morgan Falls Dam was first built, its production capacity was 10,500 kilowatts of power.  At present, the dam produces 16,800 kilowatts of power.
Although Morgan Falls Dam provides a small portion of power for the residents of Georgia today, it provides numerous benefits to the surrounding area. Flood control, wildlife habitats, and recreational opportunities are among the benefits provided by the reservoir at Bull Sluice Lake. The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area manages the waters of Bull Sluice Lake and its surrounding trail system (Gold Branch Unit). City parks run by Roswell and Sandy Springs also provide river access points for kayakers and canoeists to enjoy on-river views of Morgan Falls Dam and Bull Sluice Lake.

The EU recently reached a provisional agreement on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework (#CRCF), which will likely become a blueprint for global carbon dioxide removal (#CDR) frameworks. 🤝

This framework will create a critical foundation for scaling the voluntary market for CDRs in the EU, including . According to the , nearly all pathways to  by 2050 will require a significant scale-up of CDRs. 🌿

The EU has taken an important step in developing this framework and now must work to implement it in a timely manner, aiming to develop robust methodologies. It must also look at policy options to further support the industry, clarifying the end uses of certified removals and how it can work within international carbon markets for credits generated outside the EU. 🌍

The Strength of Rushing Streams
Water is one of the most vital natural resources of Himachal Pradesh. The State is richly endowed with a hilly terrain having an enormous volume of water from the catchment areas of Satluj, Beas, Ravi and Chenab rivers. These rivers are divided in tributaries which have opened floodgates for Hydroelectricity Generation.
While the enormous Power of Himalayan water bodies is harnessed through large Hydro Projects, Himurja is gaining significant achievements in boosting the overall Power output through Small Hydro Projects being eco-friendly and technology proven.
On the other hand, Himurja also ensures the preservation of natural resources. Implementing eco-friendly measures in all operations, we aim to create a greener environment driven by renewable energy resources.

The climate plays an essential role in hydroelectric power generation of Japan. An effort is made to clarify the basic seasonal variations of hydroelectric generation from the climatological point of view. From the viewpoint of a statistical probability, extra stand-by steam-generated powers necessary for drought are computed for each Japanese electric power and utility company.

Home What We Do Reducing Flooding Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) Lockport Powerhouse
Located in Lockport, Ill., the MWRD built the Lockport Powerhouse in 1907 which marks the southern point of the MWRD-managed Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). The Powerhouse is located where the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal connects with the Des Plaines River. The facility is an integral part of the MWRD's work to manage the CAWS to reduce the risk of flooding throughout the MWRD service area. The Powerhouse allows the MWRD to control the levels of the waterways and provides financial benefits from hydroelectric power generation. The water flowing through the facility is harnessed by two turbines to provide a safe and environmentally friendly hydroelectric energy source that is sold back to Commonwealth Edison. The MWRD earns approximately 1 million dollars per year from generating hydroelectricity at Lockport Powerhouse.

BY SECTOR
Energy
Drought and water scarcity present unique challenges for the energy sector. All sources of energy require water in their production processes, and energy is required to extract, convey, and deliver water. Because energy and water are so interdependent, the availability and predictability of water resources can directly affect energy systems.

Key Issues
Water Supply
Reduced water supply can lead to reduced energy production, and even to temporary closure of energy facilities.
Hydropower
Low water levels in reservoirs during drought conditions can reduce the energy that can be generated by hydroelectric dams.
High Temperatures
High temperatures that often accompany and exacerbate drought affect the energy supply chain, reduce biofuel feedstocks, and increase the risk of wildfire, which can impact energy infrastructure.
Drought Impacts on Energy Production
Production of all types of energy, including electricity, requires water. Because the energy sector is dependent on water availability, drought can severely impact energy systems.
Thermoelectric electricity generation. Thermoelectric power plants use steam turbines to generate electricity using a variety of fuel sources. Large amounts of water are needed to generate steam and for cooling. Drought conditions can result in reduced plant efficiency and generation capacity and can also impact the supply chain for coal, natural gas, biofuel, and nuclear fuel.  
Hydroelectric power generation. Hydroelectric power is generated by funneling water through power plants contained in dam structures. When water levels in reservoirs become low, the force of water pressure required to turn hydro turbine blades is reduced, which affects productivity. 
Hydraulic fracturing and refining. Reduced water availability affects the production and refining of petroleum and natural gas. During droughts, hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) and fuel refining operations can require alternative water supplies or may be forced to temporarily shut down. Shutdowns can increase costs, which in turn can raise consumer prices. 
Biofuels. Reduced water availability and decreased soil moisture during drought can reduce the cultivation of biofuel feedstocks.

Co-owned project between Brazil and Paraguay
  Project highlights
The Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam is located on the Paraná River on the border between Brazil and Paraguay. The structure which serves to generate power is about 7.9 km long, with a maximum height of 196 m.
The dam was developed during a period of conflict over land at the border between Brazil and Paraguay in the 1960s, as both countries perceived the untapped energy potential of the Paraná river. The joint signature of the Act of Iguaçu in 1966 and the Treaty of Itaipu in 1973 enabled the project to emerge as a binational and coordinated effort to build and manage the dam while sharing its costs and benefits. Itaipu Binacional, a company jointly owned by Brazil and Paraguay, was created by the Treaty of Itaipu to build and operate the dam.
The construction of the dam began in February 1971 and cost USD17.6 billion (2018 prices) by the time the facility started operating in 1984.
The procurement of the project was widely exposed to corruption at the construction stage, as the politicians in power encouraged the selection of private companies that had ties with political figures. Since that period, the fight against corruption and fraud has been of major importance for Itaipu Binacional and has been managed by the establishment of a General Ombudsman’s office, Ethics Committee, and Internal Audits and Compliance Advisory functions.
Today the dam, with its 20 generating units of 700 MW capacity each, is the largest operational hydroelectric energy–producing asset in the world. In 2018, the energy generated was used to supply nearly 90% of the electricity consumed in Paraguay and about 15% of that consumed in Brazil. About 85% of the energy generated by the plant is used by Brazil. The two countries have an equal right to the dam’s production, but because Paraguay only consumes 15% of its share, it is obliged to sell the rest to Brazil, with 70% of the price covering the financing of construction.
The Treaty, when originally signed, required Paraguay to sell its unused electricity to Brazil for USD124 million a year until 2023. In July 2009, the two countries signed a deal under which Brazil agreed to triple its payments to Paraguay.
Since its completion, the dam has risen as a project of the highest significance in the economic and diplomatic history of the two countries.

The Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam contract was signed and the dam built at a time when both Brazil and Paraguay were under military rule. The two countries had a long history of conflict and, in the 1960s, Brazil and Paraguay were in dispute over borderlands and the potential to produce hydroelectric power from water bodies on their shared border. Territorial sovereignty was at the heart of a conflict from March 1965 to June 1966. The Act of Iguaçu, signed on 22 June 1966, ended the conflict and “marked the first official step toward what became the Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam” and laid the groundwork for the Treaty of Itaipu signed in 1973.
The signature of the Treaty led to conflicts with Argentina, as the construction of the dam directly affects water flows received downstream on the Paraná river. This threatened Argentina’s various plans for hydropower production, such as at the then-planned Corpus hydroelectric power plant.
The conflict was resolved in the 1979 Tripartite Itaipu-Corpus Agreement, signed by Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, which sets out downstream flow requirements with which Itaipu Binacional must comply.
Policy and planning setting 
The 1966 Act of Iguaçu proclaimed that Brazil and Paraguay would commonly explore the hydroelectric potential of the resources common to the two countries, and stated the agreement that the electricity generated would be evenly shared but could be sold from one of the two parties to the other at a fixed price decided by the countries, and not at ‘cost price’ as requested by Paraguay.
The Treaty of Itaipu of 1973 further reinforced the joint agreement of both governments in “effecting the hydroelectric development of the hydraulic resources of the Paraná River.” To that effect, the
Treaty of Itaipu created a binational entity called Itaipu Binacional, founded in 1974 and co-owned by Brazil and Paraguay. The national administrations in charge of electricity in the two countries, Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras (Eletrobras, Brazil) and the Administración Nacional de Electricidad (Ande, Paraguay), each share 50% of the entity’s equity.
Annex C of the Treaty of Itaipu, which sets out the financial bases and provision of electricity services, will be reviewed by the two governments in 2023. Thiscould lead to a revision of the rules of payment of royalties (see also the Financing section of this case study). This crucial date is highly anticipated by the twogovernments as it could lead to a shift in the approach to sharing the benefits of the project. No employees of Itaipu Binacional will be involved in the discussions.
The Treaty of Itaipu also defines the conditions for the exploitation of the Paraná River, by both countries, for hydroelectric power, including the defined maximum number of generating units.
Challenges and opportunities addressed by the project
The purpose of the dam was the production of electricity to supply Brazil and Paraguay with the power needed to contribute to modern industrial development. Although the development of the dam was progressive, with the generation capacity incrementally increased, the dam was able to reach and plateau at the current level of energy production capacity within about 10 years of commencing electricity production operations (see Figure 2).
As Itaipu Binacional reports, “In 2018, the net energy generated was 95,883 GWh. Of the total, 80,839 GWh were provided for Eletrobras, which corresponds to 15% of the demand of the Brazilian market. For Ande, 15,044 GWh were supplied, serving almost 91% of the demand of the Paraguayan market.”

  Environmental and social issues
At the time the Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam was built, hydroelectric power was already a common source of energy in Brazil. Indeed, water is an abundant resource of which the country wanted to take advantage. The decision in 1973 to develop the dam was also informed by the oil crisis at the time, which made hydroelectric power appear a more stable choice than fossil fuel–based energy sources. The electricity produced in 2018 (95,883 GWh) corresponds to the equivalent energy contained in about 55 million barrels of oil. While Brazil’s electricity production is dominated by hydroelectric power plants, a large proportion of Brazil’s energy consumption still originates from fossil energy sources.
The construction of the dam incurred significant environmental and social impacts. At the time, Brazil and Paraguay did not have legislation supporting biodiversity protection. The Guaíra Falls, which most likely represented the greatest volume of falling water in the world until 1983, were submerged under the artificial lake created by the dam and dynamited to facilitate navigation.
In addition, 65,000 people were displaced – 40,000 people on the Brazilian side and 25,000 people on the Paraguayan side. Resettlement occurred in coordination between governments and Itaipu Binacional, which paid compensation of USD190 million to the displaced populations.
Perceived long-term benefits 
The dam is a major source of electricity for both countries, particularly Paraguay, for which the dam is a structural element of the country’s economy. Around 10% of the public revenues of the country are derived from ‘royalties’ (compensation payments) related to two binational hydroelectric facilities – the Itaipu and Yacyretá Hydroelectric Dams.
For Brazil, the dam is a source of energy obtained at stable prices. In both countries, it has contributed to the development of a whole region around the reservoir.
The Government of Brazil uses parts of the proceeds from the sales of generated hydroelectric power in social and environmental protection measures for local communities and habitats within and surrounding the dam reservoir, as prescribed by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 and related legislation. The allocation key provides that the areas most impacted by the dam receive the largest share of the revenues.
Since 2003, Itaipu Binacional has been conducting social and environmental protection activities, as mandated by the Brazilian and Paraguayan Governments in 2005. These activities are diverse and mostly aimed at educating the local population to live with the dam, benefiting both the local populations and the company in a win-win situation.
Activities include:
agricultural productivity and fishery protection
water quality control
creation of protected areas for biodiversity around the reservoir
development of aquaculture
rehabilitation and development support for indigenous communities
health services to local
Itaipu Binacional also helped to develop infrastructure in the region, such as bridges and hospitals. In Brazil, where development has tended to be concentrated towards the coastal region, these initiatives have contributed to the development of inland regions.
  Procuring and financing
Procurement model
The design and construction of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam was led by two consortia: Unicon (Brazilian) and Conempa (Paraguayan), while the electrical-mechanical assembly work was performed by Itamon (Brazilian) and CIE (Paraguayan).
All contracts undertaken by Itaipu Binacional must comply with the criteria and modalities defined by its general bidding standard, which determines the selection of the most advantageous proposals for the entity, considering price, quality and impacts on sustainability.
Infrastructure financing 
The costs of building the dam were assumed by loans guaranteed by the Brazilian Government. Indeed, Paraguay, which did not have the financial resources to build the plant, arranged a loan from Brazil to meet the initial capital demand plus other future investment needs. Itaipu Binacional states “the Fixed Assets in the 2018 Balance Sheet, in the amount of USD17.6 billion, may represent the price of the dam’s construction.” That amount includes the financial charges incurred during the construction until each generator unit went online. The direct investment – without financial charges – averaged USD12 billion (2018 prices). The funds raised for the construction, including financial rollovers, totalled USD27 billion, in addition to the USD100 million in paid-in capital.
The repayment of the debt is assured by sales of the energy to Eletrobras and Ande, which hire the installed power available. Itaipu Binacional permanently puts at the disposal of the two companies a given quantity of power, fixed before production: the contracted power. As such, the Treaty of Itaipu “contributes tothe predictability of revenues and cash flow and reduces the risks posed by hydrological crises [such as floods and droughts] that interfere with energygeneration.”
Eletrobras and Ande only pay for the contracted power. If the actual production exceeds the defined quantity, the two companies are not charged additional costs.
Itaipu Binacional has not been set up to commercially operate and deliver profits. As per the Treaty of Itaipu, the fare charged for the contracted power (defined as the unit cost of the electricity service) should be sufficient to cover all service costs.
The service costs include the following:
Royalties: A financial compensation payment is due to the Brazilian and Paraguayan Governments for the use of the hydraulic potential of the Paraná The amount is defined in Annex C of the Treaty of Itaipu, as the equivalent of USD650 per GWh generated by the dam. This amount cannot be inferior, annually, to USD18 million, shared equally between the two parties.
Capital investment income: This is payable to Ande and Eletrobras in the amount of 12% per year of participation in the paid-up capital, adjusted for inflation.
Operating expenses: These include expenses for personnel, materials, goods and
Financial charges and amortisation: These include costs of loans and
Reimbursement of management and supervision charges: These are payable to Ande and Eletrobras as compensation for their management and supervision efforts. The charge is calculated as the equivalent of USD50 per GWh generated by the dam.
Operating account income for the year: This is the annual balance between revenue and the cost of electricity
The rate applied throughout the year 2018, and since 2009, was USD22.60 per kW of contracted monthly power. The debt is expected to be repaid by 2023.
Sharing of costs and benefits 
As per the Treaty of Itaipu, all the costs and benefits, as well as the implementation of social and environmental mitigation measures from Itaipu Binacional, are split equally between the two countries. This means that the debt for the construction of the dam and its maintenance costs are also evenly distributed.
Furthermore, the Treaty stipulates that the total quantity of energy generated must be bought by the two countries and is divided equally, such that any surplus electricity not used by either country must be sold to the other at a price corresponding to the cost of generation defined in the Treaty.
In 2009, Paraguay used between 4% and 5% of its share of the electricity produced and in the first quarter of 2020 this figure rose to about 12.5%.
In accordance with the Treaty, Paraguay has thus been selling the rest of its share to Brazil. The Treaty, when originally signed, required Paraguay to sell its unused electricity to Brazil for USD120 million a year until 2023.
After Paraguay expressed concerns about this amount, the two countries signed a deal in July 2009 after several months of negotiation, under which Brazil agreed to triple its payments to Paraguay.
In parallel, and as per the Treaty, the Brazilian and Paraguayan Governments have been receiving ‘royalties’ (compensation payments) from Itaipu Binacional since the start of electricity production from the dam in 1985. They are paid on a monthly basis as financial compensation for the use of the natural resources of the reservoir.
The royalties are proportional to the amount of land submerged by the lake. According to Itaipu Binacional, Brazil has received USD5.7 billion in royalties since 1987, while Paraguay has received USD5.4 billion.
In Brazil, Itaipu Binacional reports that “the financial compensation is distributed as follows: 25% to states, 65% to cities and 10% to federal bodies (Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Mines and Energy, and the National Scientific and Technological Development Fund).” The Brazilian Government must pass on the funds within 10 days of payment made by Itaipu Binacional. In Paraguay, royalties are transferred to the national treasury. The Paraguayan Government decides afterwards how to redistribute the compensation, depending on government priorities.
There is no law or obligation defining which proportion of the royalties must be used to mitigate social or environmental aspects of the project; the domestic share of royalties is independent of the bilateral agreements.
Itaipu Binacional, further to the Treaty, must spend equal amounts for social and environmental monitoring programs in each country.
The fare, paid yearly by the two owners, is pegged to the US dollar. The values of royalties are calculated based on three variables: monthly energy production, the dollar adjustment factor and the exchange rate.

  Management
Political and operational coordination
The dam infrastructure is owned by the governments of Brazil and Paraguay. The two governments, through their national administrations in charge of electricity – Eletrobras and Ande, own Itaipu Binacional. Eletrobras and Ande each share 50% of the company equity. Itaipu Binacional is responsible for construction and operations of the dam.
The company’s administration is shared by both countries. It is composed of an Administrative Council (also called the Supervisory Board) and an Executive Board of Directors. The Treaty of Itaipu and the company’s bylaws define the tasks and competences of the boards. The appointment of the members of these two bodies is the responsibility of the Brazilian and Paraguayan Governments. Each position allotted to a country has its counterpart on the other side.
The Administrative Council comprises 14 members, made up of six directors from each country plus one representative from each country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Executive Board consists of six members from each country, comprising one Director General and five department representatives (see Figure 3).

Corruption, ethics and compliance
Corruption was an important issue at the time of construction. Today, the fight against corruption  and fraud is central for Itaipu Binacional. Itaipu Binacional’s commitments to combat fraud and corruption are described in the company’s Basic Policies and Guidelines, the Binational Sustainability Policy and the Ethics Code, applying to directors, officers, employees and the entire value chain.
The accounts of the company are jointly verified by external audits of the two partner countries and the results are communicated annually to the Executive Board and to the Administrative Council. Auditors are changed every two years. An independent binational Internal Audit group was established at the time the company was created and reports directly to the Supervisory Board. In addition, since 2006, Itaipu Binacional adheres to the rules of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), whose central aspect is the identification of risks and the establishment of internal controls that certify the authenticity, integrity and transparency of the information used on the elaboration of financial statements.
The General Ombudsman’s Office, an autonomous body created in 2009, serves as a communication channel between Itaipu Binacional and the public. The office receives suggestions, complaints, compliments and denunciations, and, after screening them, refers them to the relevant organisations. In parallel, the company formed an Ethics Committee that receives and evaluates any complaints about non- ethical conduct that constitutes an infringement of the values, principles and norms of the Itaipu Binacional Code of Ethics. The committee is composed of six members, equally Brazilians and Paraguayans, who are employees appointed by the Executive Board with at least one representative of the Legal Management of each country. The mandate is three years, with one allowed renewal. Decisions are adopted by a majority of votes, in meetings held every two months. The general board and general directors receive reports and recommendations periodically.
A Compliance Advisory was created in both countries and responds directly to the Executive Board, with assignments to plan, coordinate, integrate and align the activities pertinent to the integrity system and compliance, the corporate risk management system and internal control processes. In July 2017, Itaipu Binacional approved the binational integrity and compliance program, which considered anticorruption aspects in its scope.
Harmonisation of rules, standards and procedures
As a security measure, Itaipu Binacional created in 1974 a Construction Consultants Board, a group of international dam engineering experts that every four years analyses the performance of Itaipu's construction structures, conducting inspections and analysing data to assess operating and safety conditions.
A multidisciplinary team, composed of Brazilians and Paraguayans from the plant itself, has been coordinating several studies over the last few years aimed at improving technology and equipment.
Communication and outreach
Local communities are given the opportunity to influence the end use of the resources thanks to participatory mechanisms. Several channels are available for the population to make requests of Itaipu Binacional. The company’s main tools for communicating with stakeholders and the public are the Ombudsman, the Contact Us rubric online, the corporate website and social networks (e.g. Twitter and Facebook). Itaipu Binacional also uses media relations and internal communication tools, such as Itaipu Electronic Journal (JIE) and Itaipu Panel Journal (JIM).
Meetings are also organised with designated community group leaders, and once a year, Itaipu Binacional holds a 2–3 day meeting that anyone can apply to participate in, to discuss issues related to the dam.
  Conclusions
Strong governance and political support – The Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam is an example of how an infrastructure project generating important economic wealth and constructed in a context of military rule and suspicion of corruption can evolve towards more transparent governance and socio-environmental support measures.
Collaboration and sharing of benefits – One of the main challenges lay in the fact that the countries have very different sizes, needs and political agendas. The project was important for Brazil but was vital for Paraguay. The dam managed to transform tensions into collaboration, benefitting both countries.
Lack of commercial incentives – Due to the different needs and political agendas of each country at the time, the project was designed not to make a profit. Itaipu Binacional has not been set up to commercially operate and deliver The company produces electricity but is not responsible for its distribution.
Business partners – Itaipu Binacional reports that any political tensions are not reflected in the company, with every decision being discussed and made in agreement between the two parties acting as partners. Its view is that it is crucial that both countries have the same power, no matter who is buying the most energy.
Promotion of regional development – Itaipu Binacional is helping the two governments develop the surrounding region (e.g. with the development of infrastructure such as bridges) as long as it does not jeopardise the company’s budget. Investments are redirected to regions which might have been overlooked in the past.
Driver of economic development – The dam is responsible for providing an important development boost to Brazil, but even more so to Paraguay. In Paraguay, royalties from hydroelectric power generation and sales have become a main source of public income and a key driver of the country’s economy.
“Wonder of the Modern World” – From a technical point of view, the Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam is one of the largest dams in the world and was named one of the ‘Wonders of the Modern World’ in 1994 by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It produces enough electricity to supply nearly 90% of the electricity consumed in Paraguay and about 15% of that consumed in Brazil.

Abstract
Current environmental catastrophes generating from fossil fuel power generation has attracted the attention of energy planners to look for sustainable energy sources. Hydropower is one of the oldest energy sources that have been utilized all over the world to generate electricity, especially in remote areas. Being one of the most densely populated countries, the majority of power demand is fulfilled from fossil fuel. Despite having lots of rivers, Bangladesh has not explored its true potential. So, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the current hydropower potential in Bangladesh. Locations having hydropower potential is evaluated. Different technologies used for hydropower generation have been reviewed. Moreover, global hydropower potential has also been discussed in this study. Based on the economic and environmental study, it is found that small scale hydropower is most feasible in Bangladesh to provide sustainable energy. With a reasonable flow rate, 232 rivers of Bangladesh can be utilized small scale hydropower generation as well as ensuring energy security for remote people. The current study is believed to provide useful information in advancing the generation of hydropower based electricity in Bangladesh.
Keywords: Bangladesh, Hydropower, Hydropower development, Renewable Energy
1. Introduction
Currently, approximately 11% of the world population which accounts for 840 million people still lack access to electricity. Around 97% of the people population who lack quality electricity live in developing countries. Furthermore, global electricity demand will be doubled within 2050 [1–4]. International Energy Agency (IEA) report stated that about 16% of the world inhabitants won’t have access to electricity by 2030 [5]. Providing rural areas with electricity is a major issue in some countries, particularly those in Asia [6]. Besides, the sustainable generation of power has also gained attention in recent years. Ongoing environmental issues such as global warming and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) has encouraged global policymakers to shift towards clean power generation [6]. According to IEA, 2.5% of the world’s total primary energy is supplied by Hydropower in 2018 [7]. Renewable energy resources open up the possibility of clean fuel technologies and thus can be a useful solution to combat issues such as global warming [8–13]. Among different renewable energy resources, hydropower is one of the cleanest sources of energy that can be utilized to address the electricity need in rural areas. Hydropower has certain advantages such as low operation cost, low emission, low fuel cost, low price, and higher plant(s) life than conventional power plants [14]. Hydropower can be categorized based on power output, head range, and operating system usages. Table 1, shows the different classification of Hydro-Power based on the above-mentioned criteria.
Table 1
Subdivision of Hydro-Power Based on Different Criteria
Classification Description
1) Power Output [15–19]
Large Higher than 100 MW
Medium 10–100 MW
Small 1–10 MW
Mini 100 KW–1 MW
Micro 5–100 KW
Pico Less than 5 KW
2) Head Range [20–22]
Higher head 100 m and above
Medium Head 30–100 m
Lower head 2–30 m
3) The operating system[23] Considering different parameters various types and sizes of a hydropower plant can be built. Operating parameters such considering head as well as flow rate, hydropower plants can be of three types.
Run of river type In this scheme, power is generated by the natural flow of water, and the flow of water is not controlled. Naturally, it is subject to water shortage during the summer season, and water is filled in a reservoir in the rainy season. Whenever there is a high flow rate exceeding the capacity, then there is water spillage, which means loss of energy.
Reservoir type In this scheme, an excess portion of water is stored in the reservoir, and power generation is regulated based on demand. It is dependent on the topology of the land where the plant will be built.
Pumped Storage type This scheme utilizes electricity to pump up water from storage located at the bottom portion of a site to the top of the storage. This type of hydro plant works not only as an energy source but also as an energy storage device. But it is quite arduous to find a suitable location for a pumped storage type plant.
Among these technologies, Small Scale HydroPower (SSHP) is the purest form of energy since it emits less pollutants than other Large Scale HydroPower(LSHP) [24]. Besides LSHP has the disadvantage of ecological damage and large transmission loss due to long overhead transmission lines [25, 26]. For these reasons, investors have lost interest while SCHP is gaining worldwide attention. Another significant hydropower technology that has attracted attention is pumped hydro technology [27]. In this technology, water is stored in a high-head variation storage reservoir which is constructed in parallel to a large river. When energy demand is low or there is the availability of a large quantity of water, water is pumped and stored in the reservoir. This reserved water is used when there is a scarcity or when there is a need to generate electricity [27]. In 2018, the total primary energy consumption of Bangladesh was 47 Mtoe and on average 293 kgoe (kilogram oil equivalent) energy is used [28]. At the end of June 2018, only 12.72 TCF of natural gas is in reserve and 3,100 million tonnes of coal is in reserve [28]. The total energy supply by various energy resources in Bangladesh for 2017–2018 is shown in Fig. 1 [28]. From Fig. 1 it is depicted that a major portion of energy comes from natural gas.
Fig. 1
Total energy supplied (%) by various resources in Bangladesh [28].
Both the usage of coal as well as natural gas has stepped up from 2007 [29, 30]. For power generation, natural gas demand is rising day by day and power plants consume nearly 40% of the overall gas production [31]. Furthermore, there is a profound gap in production as well as demand.
In 2019 maximum demand was 13,044 MW while the maximum peak generation was12893 MW. Only Natural gas contributes to 68.49% of the total energy generation [32]. This dependency on fossil fuel is creating environmental hazards and also sustainability in this sector is deteriorating. Bangladesh government wants to meet 10% of its electricity demand by utilizing renewable sources [32, 33]. To foster the usage of sustainable sources and reduce the dependency on petroleum products, the Government of Bangladesh has undertaken some measures [34]. Not only public organizations but also private institutions are working relentlessly to harness energy from renewable energy resources. The main objective of this paper is to spotlight on the present condition of hydro based energy generation growth in Bangladesh. This study not only highlights hydro based energy generation growth but also several implications. The current aim of this article is to highlight the present situation of Hydro energy development in Bangladesh. There are hardly any review studies for Bangladesh which address hydro energy development in Bangladesh. So, this study highlights these issues and points to some implications.
2. Hydro Potential in Bangladesh
Hydro energy is one the cleanest source of energy compared to other conventional energy sources that are used for power generation on a massive scale. As both costs of supply and GHG emissions are quite low, this makes hydropower generation an excellent choice for energy harvesting. Bangladesh is bestowed with lots of rivers and rivers play an important role in the livelihood of the people of Bangladesh. Fig. 2 denotes the river network of Bangladesh [35].
Fig. 2
Map of the river network of Bangladesh [35].
Though Bangladesh is bestowed with lots of rivers, hydropower generation is not up to the mark due to the absence of high head and high flow rate. Resources are limited and proper utilization of these can lead to the generation of sustainable power for fulfilling the ever-increasing demand. Around 20% of the world’s total electricity comes from hydro energy [36]. Bangladesh is also trying to maximize hydropower generation by taking various measures. Kaptai power plant was the first hydropower plant in Bangladesh built with a capacity of 230MW. During rainy seasons, excess rain creates an opportunity to produce more hydropower and that’s why Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) is planning to establish an additional 100 MW capacity plant in this area. Along with large scale hydropower plants, micro-hydropower plants also attracted the attention of people. The first small-scale micro-hydropower plant of Bangladesh was established in Bandarban to meet the energy demand of 140 households and a temple with a capacity of 10 kW Government established a 50 kW micro-hydropower plant in Barkal Upazila, Rangamati [36].
Some potential sites for harvesting hydropower have been investigated in Bangladesh. Sustainable Rural energy project surveyed locations for micro-hydro plants in Chittagong district and it was estimated to be 135.5 MW. Sangu and Matamuhuri river basin comprising 87MW and 80 MW of hydro potential capacity is considered suitable for power generation at an affordable cost. The expected annual energy production of the Sangu and Matamuhuri project will be 300 GW/year and 200 GW/year respectively. Brahmaputra river basin has a massive potential of 1,400 MW for large scale power generation [37].
The northeastern region of Bangladesh also has a promising potential to contribute to the hydro energy sector in Bangladesh. That’s why, Northeast Regional Water Management Project (FAP-6) under Flood Action Plan (FAP), conducted a preliminary assessment to find out the potential sites and rivers to produce hydro energy. The project mainly aimed at finding the best feasible sites to establish runoff, low head hydropower plants [38]. Potential sites along with flow data are depicted in Table S1 (supplementary data). Considering 5m of head along with mean monthly discharges of these ten sites, they found the overall potential of 161 MW and energy production 1,410 GWh/year. Nine rivers were also found to be suitable from this study. Normally, during the rainy season, there is a high discharge of water and in the winter season, rivers almost dry out. So, power generation will significantly decrease in the winter season. From these nine rivers, it was estimated that annually they will produce 307 GWh and estimated power output will be 35 MW. Potential energy, as well as catchment areas of these rivers, are shown in Table 2 [39].

After three years, in 1984, a team of Chinese experts found 12 potential sites in the hill tract areas of Bangladesh to produce hydropower. Among these sites Mahamaya Chara which is located in Mirsharai, Chittagong has the highest potential to develop a small-scale hydropower plant. From feasibility study of Mahamaya Chara it was found that hydroelectricity can be produced throughout the year except in April and May. There is a proposal to construct a dam in Mahamaya Chara which will encompass an area of 10.5 km2 to reserve water and provide irrigation facilities. A mini-hydro plant will be established at the foot of dam and reservoir water will run this plant [38]. The Hill tract of Bangladesh has enormous potential for hydro energy because of numerous small rivers and canals. Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) has been trying to employ hydro energy resources to meet the energy demand in hill tract areas. As a result, LGED located several prospective sites of remote hill tract region of Bangladesh. Prospective sites along with power generation potential are given in Table 4 [38, 39].

3. Small Scale Hydropower Technology
Small-scale hydropower technology is a major subclass of renewable and sustainable energy and is getting worldwide attention due to its major advantage from an environmental perspective, the abundance of resources, and increased efficiency. Bangladesh has a huge possibility of SSHT because of its plethora of rivers and canals which provide abundant water for hydropower generation. Despite this, SSHT nearly contributes to 2.34% of electricity generation in Bangladesh [40]. To increase the SSHT generation potential it is required to review SSHT technology for its adoption in Bangladesh.
3.1. General Structure and Principle of SSHT
Hydropower plant has several benefits because of its large capacity of energy generation, size of the plant, opulence of resources, and ease of installation and maintenance compared to other energy resources [39]. But its existing efficiency and water power are not easy to extract without a proper generation system. The proper generation of SSHT principally depends on the head and flow [41, 42]. Head refers to water pressure determined by the elevation difference of intake and turbine expressed as vertical distance or force per square area. Flow is defined by the rate with which the water passes, expressed as the volume of water per unit time. These two factors (head and flow) play a major role in the performance of the turbine [43]. Major components of SSHT include water supply and penstock pipe, turbine, electronic controller, distribution system, and electrical load. SSHT’s working principle can be summarized as two-stage:
Firstly, water from reservoir flow hits the pen stack pipe which ultimately hits the turbine runner by which the first energy extraction takes place.
Secondly, the turbine system drives the generator when the shaft has attached with it, which converts the hydraulic power to mechanical power, and the generator to convert the mechanical power to electricity. Finally, this power is distributed through load and grid.
To access the potentiality of SSHT it is necessary to find out the energy generation, hydropower, and mechanical power potentiality. The ratio of these, which is hydropower and mechanical power potentialities indicates the experimental efficiency of the SSHT. Researchers have shown how to determine the hydro and mechanical power potentiality [42, 45, 46].

Several researchers have conducted experimental and numerical simulations to predict the efficiency of SSHT [47]. The study depicts that modern hydro turbine has 90% efficiency for converting mechanical energy to electricity by reducing the size of the turbine [43]. Computational fluid dynamics is used largely to define the interaction among various components of hydropower, but this process may not able to evaluate loss and flow behaviour [48].
3.2. Basic Small Hydropower System
3.2.1. Turbine types based on the working principle
The hydro turbine is the principal component of SSHT. According to their work principle, hydro turbines are classified into two types: impulse turbines and reaction turbines. In SSHT suitability of impulse and reaction turbine are based on available water head.
3.2.1.1. Impulse turbine
In an impulse turbine, steam strikes the blades, and moving steam circulates through the blade. Depending upon the water head, impulse turbines have several types which are shown in Table S2 (supplementary data) [49].
3.2.1.2. Reaction turbine
In this turbine, steam hits the blades axially and circulates the blades circumferentially. Depending upon the water head, the reaction turbines have several types Considering medium head (30–100m), there are two types, one is Francis Turbine and another is Pump as a turbine. For ultra-low head which indicates head below 2m, two main types of the turbine are Propeller Turbine and Kaplan Turbine [49].
3.2.2. Turbine types based on economic and technological point of view
Based on the economic and technological point of view four turbines, namely: Pelton, Francis, Kaplan, and Turgo turbine are widely used because of the low cost of the powerhouse, efficiency generation, and head suitability.
3.2.2.1. Pelton turbine
Pelton turbine consists of a split bucket surrounding particular rims where water jet from penstock is accelerated and made to flow out rapidly causing high-speed water jets to ultimately hit the blade which revolves the wheel generating torque on its shaft and generating power by converting head pressure into kinetic energy [50]. It consists of four parts: nozzle and flow regulator, runner and bucket, casing, and braking jets. Geometric design (diameter of bucket center, nozzle, jet, and width) and jet velocity of Pelton turbines depends on the speed of the runner, head of water, and rate of flow, and is calculated as using the following equations [51, 52]:

H = net head of water in meters
N = speed of the runner
Q = flow rate in cubic meter
K = number of nozzles
D1/B1 > 2.7
3.2.2.2. Turgo turbine
Turgo turbine is an impulse type turbine where high-speed water jet hits the turbine blades resulting in reverse flow. Basic parts of this turbine are nozzle, runner and buckets, casing, and breaking jets. Though the Turgo turbine is an extension of the Pelton turbine it has some physical differences. Turgo turbine has numerous advantages over Pelton turbines such as low cost of rotors, high flow rate, and control regulation of flow rate. Additionally, as there are fixed jets in the Turgo turbine it is necessary to maintain a fixed rate of flow.
3.2.2.3. Francis turbine
Francis turbine is designed in such a way that one part of the blade creates pressure difference on others for the production of electricity in hydropower stations. This turbine is the combination of both impulse and reaction types where blades revolve through the reaction and impulse force of the flow. It consists of a spiral casing, stays vanes, guided vanes, runner blades, and draft tube. Although it has several advantages, the inception of this turbine is difficult and cavitation along with dirt creates a serious problem. The geometric shape of this turbine can be found following the equations listed below [50–53]:

3.2.2.4. Kaplan turbine
Kaplan turbine is principally based on axial flow reaction where water flows through a runner along the axis of rotation of the runner [43]. The reaction force of water is responsible for turning the Kaplan turbine [54]. Basic components of the Kaplan turbine are scroll casing, guide vane, draft tube, and runner blades. Upstream installed guide vane creates better efficiency of the Kaplan turbine. In Kaplan turbine, the cavitation problem due to pressure drop in the draft tube creates serious problems that can be mitigated by using stainless steel in runner blades. The basic dimension of Kaplan turbines is determined by applying the following equations [51, 52]. Table S3 (supplementary data) shows various types of turbines along with their heads and their suitable operating condition [55].

3.2.3. Penstock & valves
The penstock is used to lead the water to the turbine and materials should be chosen carefully so that it can handle the water pressure going towards the turbine [56]. The diameter of the penstock can be measured via equation (15) [57]. Various loss associated with penstock is delineated in Table S4 (supplementary data) [57].

3.3. Previous Work through Numerical and Experimental Simulation
Numerous studies are performed focusing on the flow behavior of fluids concerning energy transformation, velocity and pressure variation, and water head and its effect on turbines performance which are summarized in Table 5.
Table 5
Summary of Previous Research Work Reported on SSHT
Study Research objective Results
[58] Use large eddy current simulation on several blade and vane angles considering fluid as unsteady and incompressible flow, to determine the effect of pressure and flow velocity on hydro turbine efficiency.
- At 320 blade angle maximum and minimum static pressure exists.
- At 600, 650 and 700 blade angles maximum static pressure are 213 kPa, 217 kPa, and 207 kPa respectively.
- Efficiency and pressure distribution of hydro turbines vary with guide vane angle.
[59] Numerical simulation to find the effect of tip speed ratio on power generation.
- Up to tip speed ratio 6.5, the power output increases with increasing tip speed ratio.
- Beyond that, the power output decreases with increasing speed ratio.
- High pressure exists in the font of the turbine and there is low pressure on its backside.
- For a definite flow velocity torque decreases in a quasilinear fashion with rotating velocity.
[60] Measure the pressure drop, energy extraction, torque of hydro turbine.
- The pressure drop across the turbine increases with using nozzle and diffuser for axial flow turbines which generates more power from water energy.
- For specific water flow, velocity torque decreases in a quasi-linear fashion with increasing rotational speed.
- As in any definite rotating speed, torque reduces as subsequent flow speed decreases.
- With increasing rotating speed, power extraction increases up to the maximum power, beyond which further increasing rotating speed reduces power extraction.
[61] Investigate the shot water wheel performance.
- The acceptable efficiency of the water wheel is 74.85% which lies within acceptable ranges (70% to 96%).
- Analytical and actual water strike curve vane on the bucket velocity is 10.22 m/s and 11.3 m/s respectively.
[62] Investigate the effect of flow velocity on the performance of SSHT.
- Investigation shows that for NACA63415 shaped turbines, where blade with 0.5m radius, power generation increases with the flow velocity. Among three different flow velocities (1 m/s, 1.5 m/s, and 2 m/s), maximum power generation was by 2 m/s flow velocity. For 1 m/s to 1.5 m/s and 1.5 m/s to 2 m/s flow velocity variation output increases up to 3 to 8 times respectively.
[63, 64]
- For marine current turbines similar behavior like is observed here for flow velocity of 2.5 m/s and 5 m/s. Investigation results show that with increasing flow velocity power generation increases up to maximum power, beyond this reverse phenomenon is seen.
[49] Effect of the water wheel in hydro turbine.
- For head below 2m water, the wheel is more preferred.
[65]
- Maximum water wheel efficiency is obtained for 6 number blades rather than 8 to 12 number blades.
- 6, 8 and 12 number blades generate power of 0.041W, 0.036W and 0.026W respectively.
- 6 bladed waterwheel showed 57% improved efficiency than 12 bladed wheels.
[66] Effect of the arrangement of turbine on hydraulic efficiency.
- Triangular arrangement along with 645 mm spacing extract maximum power in comparison with rhombus, square, series, parallel arrangement.
[67] Novel propeller turbine performance investigation through CFD analysis.
- The turbine operation largely depends on the existing flow rate and mismatching of turbine rotor design.
- Flow rate affects the output which is possible to reduce by new rotor design.
[68] CFD analysis was performed to analyze air supply method for crossflow turbine.
- The position of the air layer in turbine runner passage plays an important role in preventing shocking loss and recirculation flow in the runner.
- The performance of turbine largely depends on the position of the air suction hole on the chamber wall.
[69] To predict water performance of horizontal axis tidal stream CFD fluent analysis is performed.
- Changing the tip shape slightly improved the cavitation performance of the raked tip turbine.
[70] To evaluate performance analysis of pico type turbine CFX CFD with varying runner blade shape
- Lower blade angle hydro turbine shows better performance than higher blade angle.
[71] CFD analysis was performed to optimize the complex geometry of the Kaplan blade.
- Change in orientation and geometry of the blade affects the turbine blade efficiency.
[72] Both CFD and experimental studies were carried out to determine the performance of the Kaplan turbine at full and partial loading.
- For total pressure at mid-span shows that at the suction side of blade pressure remain below vapor pressure.
[73] CFD analysis was performed to determine the suitability of turbine at high head river and efficiency of mini-hydropower at Panching waterfall
- For high head mini-hydropower Pelton elbow PVC turbine is most suitable.
- The efficiency of the Pelton turbine is 0.961 whereas the Pelton elbow PVC is 0.97.
[74] Experimental and CFD analyses were performed to determine axial flow pump performance.
- The axial pump can efficiently work as a turbine and is best suitable for a developing country where proper turbines are not easily available.
[75] Experimental study was performed to find out the factor influencing rotation per minute (rpm) of the water wheel.
- Because of the higher volume retained by the triangular blade, it produces high rpm than the propeller blade shape, and the 20° nozzle angle shows maximum efficiency for both propeller and triangular waterwheel.
[76] CFD analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of the portable microhydrokinetic turbine.
- Maximum power coefficient of 0.43 with 73.7% efficiency is achieved relative to Betz limit, and propeller design portable hydrokinetic turbine may not require a large civil engineering structure.
It is evident from Table 5 that power generation from the hydro turbine is contingent upon various factors, such as pressure drop, vane angle, tip speed ratio, flow velocity, the arrangement of the hydro turbine, position of air suction hole on the chamber wall. As a result, while installing SSHT for a specific region, these factors are crucial to design and efficiently operate the hydropower generation process. For instance, the tip speed ratio is an important factor for harvesting power from hydro energy. Up to a maximum tip speed of 6.5 is sufficient for generating efficient power. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis is widely used for analyzing the performance of SSHT considering various conditions which are evident from Table 5. For analyzing the effect of various parameters such as the position of air suction hole, flow rate, tip shape, blade angle, varying head, the orientation of turbine blades, and geometry CFD analysis is extensively used which are discussed in Table 5. There are still lots of scope for development in harnessing energy from hydropower. Advanced modelling and controlling techniques to maximize the operation of the hydro turbine is need to be explored. Currently, numerous research and development are ongoing for the development of technologies of hydropower such as improving hydropower flexibility, fish-friendly hydro turbine design, energy storage with variable speed turbines etc. [77].
4. Economic and Environmental Aspects
Economic analysis plays an important role in the hydropower project. The capital cost involved in the hydropower project is relatively very high while operation and maintenance cost is low. Besides cost, site and environmental characteristics should also be paid attention during the feasibility stage of the project. In this section, economic and environmental analysis has been carried out.
4.1. Economic Analysis
Installed capacity, hydraulic head and estimated cost per kW should be considered for cost estimation of the Hydropower project. Aggidis et al. [78] developed formulas to estimate the cost of Hydropower project based on hydraulic characteristics (head and flow) of a site. The above-mentioned formulas are shown below

The cost of electromechanical equipment (gearbox, turbine and generator) depends on the hydraulic characteristics of the sites. For small scale hydro projects, the following equations can be utilized to estimate the electromechanical equipment cost. Here, is the electromechanical equipment cost [79].

In the above-mentioned costs, there was no way to differentiate between the expenses between different types of turbines. For instance, Kaplan turbine generally has two bands of flow rates that are used to find out the relationship between turbine cost and flow rate. For the flow rate between (0.5 m3/s and 5 m3/s), the following equation can be used.

4.2. Environmental Aspects
The increased reliability of production of energy from the renewable resources will impart positive impacts on the environment by reducing the pollution being caused by the utlisation of fossil fuels [80–85]. Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) stated that SHS has minimal impact on flora and fauna, has minimal deforestation, and negligible submergence [86]. Besides, Kosnik also stated that the impact of hydro technology on the environment decreases with the size of the technology. This study also stated that SHS has also minimal riverine impact than large scale hydro [87]. Besides IEA also believed that the minimal environmental impact of SHS is due to construction activities and changes in water quality [7]. IEA also delineated that; flooding caused due to SHS is minimal than large scale systems. Besides no large dam is necessary for SHS and this construction period is less. Varun et al. [88] also put SHS beside wind as a sustainable energy source for energy generation since these systems emit only 31–75 CO2/kWh in the atmosphere. Chhetri et al. [90] also highlighted the issue and complemented SHS as a sustainable source.
5. Global Hydro Resource Potential
The world hydropower installed capacity is estimated to be 1,132 GW in 2018 [90]. More than 20 GW was added in 2018 to reach this installed capacity. More than 35% of new installations have been made in China which as a result makes them the leader [91]. Several studies have also assessed the hydropower potential. To measure gross hydropower potential in Europe, a model-based approach was undertaken by Lehner et al. [92] with consideration of socio-economic changes and climate. The synthetic hydro network was used by Cyr et al. [93] to map the small hydropower resources. The gross, technical, and economic hydropower potentials in China were estimated as 6.1 petawatt hours per (pWh), 2.5, and 1.8 pWh, respectively [94, 95]. The hydropower potential in the United States was estimated at 2.7 pWh/year [96]. A study by Zhou et al. [96] reported that total global gross hydropower potential is estimated to be approximately 128 pWh/year. The technical potential is 26 pWh/year. The economic potential ranges from 8 to 25 pWh/year with a cut-off cost from 0.05 to 0.15 $/kWh/year [96]. In 2018, pumped storage capacity also showed an increment of 1.9 GW and the year-end total was 160 GW [90]. The majority of these installations are from China, Austria, and the United States.
6. Recommendations
In Bangladesh, the land is scarce, and developing large scale hydropower plant will bring about negative impacts such as destroying the ecosystem in the selected area, relocation of living beings, methane formation, etc. Moreover, building these kinds of large hydro plants requires a constant high flow of water flow along with high construction cost which is not feasible for a developing country like Bangladesh. The small scale Hydropower plant is gaining importance in providing sustainable hydropower in developing countries [16]. Small scale hydro turbine can be operated between 3m to 10m head, so it is a feasible solution for power generation like the flat landscape in Bangladesh along with low water head. Our northeastern region has a good amount of flow rate of water and head, so more micro hydro pants can be developed in these regions. Bangladesh has almost 232 rivers along with a reasonable flow rate [55]. So, developing small scale runoff hydro plants is a good way to harness more energy from hydropower. We can utilize the natural flow of these rivers to generate small scale hydropower to supply decentralized energy to the remote area people. As a result, overall pressure on the national grid will deduce. From the economic analysis, it is recommended that proper technology and site selection should be done during the feasibility study. Proper selection of these parameters is necessary for economic sustainability. The environmental analysis, it is clear that Bangladesh should avoid large scale hydro systems. Importance should be given on small scale systems since its effect on the environment is marginal.
7. Conclusions
Due to rapid financial advancement energy usage is on the rise in Bangladesh. The energy demand is increasing with a forecasted rate of abridgement around 7–8% per year. To achieve the goal of vision 2020, Bangladesh needs to invest in more on renewable energy projects. It will provide both ample job opportunities and green sustainable energy. Furthermore, to cope up with energy demand, the trend of renewable-based grid-connected power and increment of total generation capacity is on the rise nowadays. In this study, hydro energy potential in Bangladesh, as well as significant accomplishments are explained in detail. The assessment of modern appliances is also delineated in this study. Several latest technologies, for example, pumped hydro projects can be a suitable option to fulfil the energy demand of people. More research on the small-scale hydropower feasibility and its economic and environmental benefit is also needed to be studied for Bangladesh. Efficient control and optimized design of small-scale hydro turbines considering site locations and environmental conditions need to be assessed in the future. Furthermore, onsite data exploration such as climatic conditions, long term data analysis of flow rate in various seasons, water pressure for individual potential small scale hydropower plant needs to be further explored.

How does INL research support the future of hydropower?
To advance next-generation hydropower and pumped storage systems for a flexible, reliable power grid, INL works with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office to enable research, development and testing of emerging technologies.
INL focuses on research to support resilient hydropower and developing hydropower tools and technologies. INL researchers are innovating in:
Hybrid storage systems integration: INL designs power system controls to enable integration of hydropower with power storage technologies such as batteries and ultracapacitors. Storing energy from run-of-river hydropower creates a virtual reservoir that enables the combined system to contribute to grid stability and reliability, reduce wear on hydropower components, improve ramp times, and increase overall system efficiency.
Irrigation modernization: INL is leading a DOE effort to develop the “irrigation district of the future,” a concept that blends innovations from across the agriculture and energy domains to increase the benefits derived from irrigation systems.
Pumped storage hydropower simulation: To facilitate rapid prototyping of pumped storage hydropower design, INL develops models that enable unique, more representative environments to test controllers and power converter hardware.

Renewable energy powered by water
Hydroelectric power or hydropower is a clean, renewable energy source that generates about 10% of the nation’s energy. While simple in concept, hydroelectric power is highly efficient and environmentally friendly.
Traditional Hydropower
Dominion Energy hydroelectric power stations are unique in design and operation. Hydropower is used to supplement power from other stations during periods of high energy demand. The most common type uses a dam on a river to store water in a reservoir. Water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which activates a generator that produces electricity.
But hydroelectric power doesn't need a large dam. Some hydropower plants can use a small canal to channel the river water through a turbine.
Pumped Storage
Pumped storage plants such as Bath County Pumped Storage Station can even store power. The power grid will send energy into the electric generators at the station. The generators will spin the turbines backward, causing the turbines to pump water from a river or lower reservoir to an upper reservoir. There, power is stored in the form of water to be used in the future.
To use the power, the water is released from the upper reservoir back down into the river or lower reservoir. This spins the turbines forward, activating the generators to produce electricity.

Powers approximately 23,750 homes
Roanoke Rapids, NC
Facts
Commercial operations began in 1955.
The facility is located on Roanoke Rapids lake, which is created by the power station dam.
The lake is supplied by water from the Roanoke River that is regulated eight miles upstream by Dominion Energy's Gaston Hydro Power Station and Gaston Dam.
When water is allowed to pass from the lake through the powerhouse, the station's four generators can produce up to 95 megawatts.
The station can produce as much electric power in one hour as about 10 average homes use in one year.
It took 245,000 cubic yards of concrete to build the dam—the equivalent of a sidewalk six feet wide and 189 miles long.
The power house rests atop a rock foundation 70 feet above sea level and rises at its crest to an elevation of 142 feet above sea level.

What would the world be like without mathematics? Let's look a little into the history of mathematics!

Mathematics: A Brief History

- The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 3000 BC.
- The ancient Greeks greatly refined the methods and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.
- The development of zero in India was a major breakthrough in mathematics.
- The Islamic Golden Age saw a flowering of mathematical research, with contributions from mathematicians such as Al-Khwarizmi and Omar Khayyam.
- The Renaissance saw a revival of interest in Greek mathematics, and new discoveries were made by mathematicians such as Fibonacci and Descartes.
- The 17th century saw the development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz.
- The 19th century saw the development of new branches of mathematics such as group theory and topology.
- The 20th century saw the development of modern mathematics, with contributions from mathematicians such as Gödel and Turing.

Mathematics Today

- Mathematics is used in a wide variety of fields, including science, engineering, finance, and computer science.
- Fields like calculus, statistics, and number theory play essential roles in shaping our technological advancements.

It is Nord Pool’s long-held belief that shared order books, in both intraday and day-ahead timeframes, are essential to enable full and fair competition between power exchanges in Europe. In our view, the sharing of order books should be mandatory whenever technically possible. 

The recent EC proposals on power market reform, combined with commentary from other power exchanges, have pushed shared order books back in the spotlight.

Many years ago I did a calculation of this type
Horizontal Roof Area = say 100m^2 (for ease)
Rainfall per annum =89 cm (average for UK)- lets say 1 metre for ease
Total rainfall on oof per year = 100 x 1 = 100 m^3
Height of gutter 6 or 7m but lets say 10m for ease.
Density of water = 1000 mkg/m^3
Total Potential Energy availaible for conversion= mgh
=(100 x 1000) x g x 10 (and let g= 10N/kg for ease.
=10^7J
Now 1 kwh ( 1 unit of electrical energy costing about 15p ) = 3.6 x10^6 J

Did Harry inherit more than William?
Yes and no. When the Queen mother died back in 2002 she left more money to Harry, knowing that William would eventually become Prince and inherit the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate valued at over $1 billion.
Which is exactly what happened when Queen Elizabeth passed away in 2022. So overall, Willian inherited quite a bit more than Harry.
But this $1 billion estate is nothing compared to the $10 billion that King Charles received tax free, thanks to a clever investment by the Queen into one of the world’s most exclusive asset classes … fine art.
The Royal family has been investing a portion o

Can rain water in a domestic drain pipe be used to generate hydroelectric electricity that can be part of a gravity flow turning an induction coil?
Sure. Spend heaps of money and generate enough electricity to maybe (!) provide enough light to replace a small candle for one night a year.
You can work out the numbers if you want, there are hydro-electricity calculators online (you might have to multiply one or more of the inputs by 100 to get the calculator to recognise them and then divide the answer by 100 for each time you multiplied).
Buying one AA battery would probably be more effective and

Yes, on a very small scale as per Mr. Upton’s excellently explained answer. It’s not a practical project but you could call it a novelty demonstration. While a heavy rain is coming down you might be able to illuminate a single miniscule light bulb.

Our hydro schemes
We operate the largest fleet of hydro-electric power assets across eight hydro schemes in Scotland.
These include some of the most iconic power station sites built after the introduction of the 1943 Hydro Electric Development (Scotland) Act, which brought hydro-electric power to the Scottish Glens 80 years ago.
Number of hydro electric schemes
Total installed capacity
MW
Our hydro portfolio totals 1,459MW of installed capacity, including 300MW of pumped storage and 750MW of flexible hydro. This includes the 100MW Glendoe Power Station which opened in 2009 becoming the first large-scale hydro power station to be constructed in Scotland since the hydro revolution of the 1940s and ‘50s.
We're putting hydro at the heart of a net-zero future
As Britain transitions to a renewables-led net zero energy system, we're actively seeking investment opportunities for hydro generation, including repowering of existing hydro power plants and adding pumping capabilities to existing stations.
Coire Glas potential investment

bn
Generating capacity
GWh
We're currently developing two new pumped hydro storage projects to deliver the large-scale, long-duration electricity storage needed as part of Britain’s future energy mix and set out in 2022 in the UK Government’s ‘British Energy Security Strategy’. These include plans to develop our fully consented 30GWh Coire Glas project in the Scottish Highlands, a potential £1.5bn-plus investment in what could be Britain’s biggest pumped hydro storage scheme in 40 years.
We've also announced plans to convert our 152.5MW Sloy Power Station, Britain’s largest conventional hydro power plant in central Scotland, into a new 25GWh pumped hydro storage facility.
We're repowering Tummel Bridge
We're currently investing around £50m in the repowering of our existing Tummel Bridge Hydro-Electric Power Station with modern and efficient turbine technology. The repowering is expected to extend the station’s operational life by at least 40 years.
Repowering investment around

Repowered peak output up to
MW
This means the Tummel Bridge Hydro plant will be running in the power system of 2050 and so will play a continuing role in harnessing hydro power for a net-zero future in Scotland and the UK. The repowering programme will increase generation output at the plant from 34MW to 38MW, with a peak output of 40MW during optimum conditions.
Originally completed in 1933, Tummel Bridge has recently passed it's 90th year in service and is being prepared to help provide the energy we need for decades more to come.
We're protecting and enhancing the natural environment
Many major river systems in the Highlands have long been renowned as breeding grounds for salmon and trout. As far back as the 1943 Act of Parliament that established the North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board, there was a requirement on us to avoid, as far as possible, injury to fisheries and the stock of fish.
When our power stations and dams were first constructed during the second half of the last century, great care was taken to minimise their environmental impact.
As we have refurbished our stations, great care has been taken to ensure modern technology is employed to further reduce the environmental impact of the stations.

 Classification of hydro power plant
1. Classification of Hydro Power Plant Prepared by Prof. S. G. Taji Dept. of Civil Engineering S.R.E.S’s Sanjivani College of Engineering, Kopargaon
2. Classification of Hydropower Plants 2According to Availabilit y of Head High Medium Low According to Capacity Large Medium Small Mini Micro According to Facility Type Run-of-River without Pondage Run-of-River with Pondage In-stream Storage Type Pump Storage According to Purpose Single Multi According to Hydrologic al Relation Single Stage Cascade
3. According to Availability of Head Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 3  High Head Plants  Head: 100m to 2000m  Mainly in these plants pressure tunnel is provided before the surge tank, which in turn connected to penstock.  A pressure tunnel is taken off from the reservoir and water brought to the valve house at the start of the penstocks.  The penstocks are huge steel pipes which take large quantity of water from the valve house to the power house.
4. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 4
5. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 5  Medium head plants  Head : 30 to 100m  Mainly forebay provided before the Penstock, acts as water reservoir for medium head plants.  In this plants mainly water is carried through main reservoir to forebay and then to the penstock.  The forebay acts as surge tank for these plants.  The turbines used will be Francis type of the steel encased variety.
6. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 6
7. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 7  Low Head Plant  < 30 m  In this case small dam is built across the river to provide the necessary head.  In such plants Francis or Kaplan type of turbines are used.
8. According to Capacity Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 8  LARGE: >100 MW  MEDIUM: 25 – 100 MW  SMALL: 1-25 MW  MINI: 100 KW - 1MW  MICRO: 5 – 100 KW
9. According to Load Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 9  Base Load Plants:  they cater to the base load of the system, they need to supply constant power when connected to the grid.  These Plants are mainly depending on the nature of load.  If demand is more, this plants are used regularly and load factor of this plants are high.
10. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 10  Peak load Plants:  These plants are mainly used during the peak load.  Run-off river plants with poundage can be used as peak-load plants.  Reservoir plants with enough storage behind the dam can be used either as base load or as peak load plants as required.
11. According to Facility Type Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 11  Run-of-river Type without Pondage  These are hydro power plants that utilize the stream flow as it comes , without any storage being provided.
12. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 12  Run of river plants with pondage  May work as base load or peak load plants.  Storage for a day to day fluctuation or even for a week  Poundage permits storage of water during the off –peak period and use of this water during peak periods.
13. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 13  Storage Type Plant  Hydropower plants with storage are supplied with water from large storage reservoir that have been developed by constructing dams across rivers.  Assured flow for hydro power generation is more certain for the storage schemes than the run-of-river schemes.  Flow is controlled
14. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 14
15. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 15  Pumped storage plants  Pumped storage type hydropower plants are those which utilize the flow of water from a reservoir at higher potential to one at lower potential.  During off-peak hours, the reversible units are supplied with the excess electricity available in the power grid which then pumps part of the water of the tail-water pond back into the head-water pond.
16. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 16
17. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 17  IN-STREAM  When the velocity of water i.e kinetic energy flowing in the stream is used for conversion into electrical power, then the system is known as In-stream.
18. Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 18  Mini and Microhydel plants  Mini – 5m to 20 m head  Micro – below 5 m head  These plants are scattered in our country and estimated potential is 20,000MW.  Each plant can generate about 100 to 1000kW power.
19. According to Hydrological Relation Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 19  SINGLE STAGE  When the run off from a single hydropower plant is diverted back into river or for any other purpose other than power generation, the setup is known as Single Stage.
20. 20  CASCADE SYSTEM  When two or more hydropower plants are used in series such that the runoff discharge of one hydro power plant is used as the is a intake discharge of the second hydro power plant such a system is known as CASCADE hydropower plant.
21. According to Purpose Prepared by: Prof. Taji S. G. 21  SINGLE PURPOSE  When the whole soul purpose of a project is to produce electricity then such a project is known as a Single Purpose Hydro Power Project.  MULTIPURPOSE  When the water used in hydropower project is to be used for other purposes like irrigation, flood control or fisheries then such a project is known as Multi Purpose Hydro Power Project.

US Water law is the most complex law in the country, and it’s entangled by every person, beast, municipality, and state that has a right to that water. My uncle wanted a retaining pond on his ranch. He built an earth dam to prevent a tributary from immediately emptying into the Pit river. He thought it was his land, his dam, his right.
Within a month, he was sued by more than 450 people and warned by multiple government apparati that he was in violation of eight federal, state, and county laws. He demolished the dam. A year later he reflected that if he heard that someone upstream had dammed a

Did Harry inherit more than William?
Yes and no. When the Queen mother died back in 2002 she left more money to Harry, knowing that William would eventually become Prince and inherit the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate valued at over $1 billion.
Which is exactly what happened when Queen Elizabeth passed away in 2022. So overall, Willian inherited quite a bit more than Harry.
But this $1 billion estate is nothing compared to the $10 billion that King Charles received tax free, thanks to a clever investment by the Queen into one of the world’s most exclusive asset classes … fine art.
The Royal family has been investing a portion o

It’s not the generation of the electricity that’s the issue. It’s restricting the flow of water. Water is highly regulated in the US. Who owns it and who gets to use it are key. You can generate electricity if you get a permit to use the water for that purpose. If you need to put in a reservoir to store the water, or to increase the head for generation purposes then you will probably impact downstream water users who have rights to it. Also, you may impact the environment downstream or spawning of fish in the stream by any dam or impediment you put in place.

Your premise is false. I’m aware of many hydro-electric facilities owned and operated on private land by the landowner. Most of the really small ones (a few kilowatts) fly under everyone’s radar. My work focuses on hydro at or above 5 MW, but smaller projects of a few hundred kW do interact with us at the utilities. I happened on one 300-kW facility while doing other work and got a tour from the owner. Here he is giving a tour to our US Senator:

Premise HOPELESSLY incorrect. Whoever told you this was either trolling you, or was pig-ignorant themselves.
The US Department of Energy even gives basic instructions on how to do so.
30 seconds on Google would have told you this.

What are a few of the dumbest mistakes people make on the internet right now?
There are tons (obviously), but in my mind these are the worst:
1. Not using an adblocker.
If you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am begging you to try one. I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life.
A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet.
No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc. It’s incredible.
Most people I know use Total Adblock (link here
) – it’s $2.42/month, but there are plenty of solid options.
Ads also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more)

Waterfalls to Generate Clean Energy: Curitiba’s First Hydroelectric Power Plant
CURITIBA
January 2020
Curitiba is taking advantage of the existing waterfalls from artificial lakes in its parks to generate clean energy for the city. The installation of the first Hydroelectric Energy Generator (CGH), in the Barigui Park, is set to produce clean energy without damaging the environment. This is thanks to the energy efficiency program of Curitiba City Hall, which also encompasses new legislation that allows the use of public spaces to produce renewable energy. The project was accompanied by an environmental impact assessment, concluding that there is no change on the lake’s flow rate nor issues for the animals. The hydroelectric energy reduces the necessity of using thermoelectric plants, which corresponds to 14% of the Brazilian energy matrix. This will thus reduce CO2e emissions, and contribute to the municipal resources savings. 
The project encompasses multiple actions, providing a landscape structure around the CGH to disclose environmental and educational actions to the benefit of the population, nurturing awareness about clean energy, and to the preservation of the environment and actions to tackle climate change. 
What is the project? How does it work?
It is the first Hydroelectric Power Plant of Curitiba, with a potential to generate 30Kw of electricity, and the first to utilize the Archimedes' screw principle, the mechanism of helical thread, in an urban environment.
It is a project that encompasses environmental protection, flood management, production of clean energy and environmental awareness.
What are the CO2 reduction goals?
Climate change is already causing an impact on the city, mainly in the occurrence of heavy storms, cloud bursts and flooding. The CGH has the objective to reduce the city’s GHG emissions, producing clean energy taking advantage of the existing lakes while preserving their biodiversity and reducing neighbouring population vulnerability.
Next Steps
The project is first being implanted in Bairgui Park, a popular site for visitors. There are currently two more in development.
The Hydroelectric Energy Generator Plan in Barigui park has the potential to generate 30Kw. The CGH in São Lourenço Park has the potential of more 30Kw while the Lago Azul Park of another 1Kw. By the end of 2020, the generation started in July 2019 will be at least duplicated.
Benefits

Environmental
Key Impact
Curitiba is tapping into the potential of using waterfalls from articificial lakes to generate clean energy for the city using hydropower
Since
13th September 2018
Initial Investments
The first CGH in Barigui park had the total cost of U$S 62.000,00 but was donated by the Brazilian Association of Small Hydroelectric Power Plants. The next two in São Lourenço Park nad Blue Lake Park will have a cost of U$S 67.000,00.

Question
Give your opinion about whether hydro electric plants are environment friendly or not?
Solution
Verified by Toppr
No waste products and harmful gases are released in water bodies and atmosphere when power is generated using hydroelectric power plants. Also, water is available in plenty on Earth and is renewable. Hence, there is no fear of this energy source dying out. Thus, it has no harmful effects on the environment and hence is environment friendly.

Yesterday I had the opportunity to tour an historic building in downtown Los Angeles with the USGBC-Los Angeles located at 601 W. 5th Street.  The building currently known as as Cal Edison was built in 1931 and was the former headquarters of Southern California Edison (SCE).  The building is certified LEED Platinum, and has managed to keep at lot of the original design.  The highlight of the tour was the visit to the executive floor aka the penthouse.  A lot of the original decor is still in place including the leather wall paper.  I have an appreciation for history and architecture, thank you to the Rising Realty Partners  for hosting a wonderful event.

I recently returned from a trip to one of our  Battery Energy Storage System projects in what is probably the most northern part of our territory, Bridgeport, CA.  I’m proud of the work we are doing in energy storage and grid resiliency, once this system is online it will enhance our islanding and microgrid capabilities.  Secondly I’ve grown to love the Eastern Sierra Mountains, the environment is spectacular, picturesque and the air up there is different.  #energystorage #environment #sce Southern California Edison (SCE)

Awesome time at the Southern California Edison (SCE) Lineman Rodeo and company picnic.  Saw faces I haven’t seen in years.  Thanks to my new walking buddy Tom Guntrip, great walking and talking the 5K.  The best part of the day was taking a tour of the new mobile command center which was transported by the all electric E Cascadia.  Already looking forward to next year

As we celebrate Black History Month, we’re excited to continue sharing insights and learnings from our fellow Fountaineers. 

This week, Fountain’s Events Manager Jake Keller reveals how he celebrates Black History Month and why it’s important to him. 

Q: Why is BHM important to you?

A: This is the time the U.S. celebrates African Americans’ contributions and achievements throughout history. It’s a celebration of Black America’s voices and stories.

Q: How do you celebrate BHM?

A: Usually by celebrating with friends and family and participating in local BHM activities.

Q: What action do you hope to see companies take in light of BHM?

A: Create a space for all employees to truly learn, listen, and share their knowledge and experiences.

Q: Is there anything about BHM you wish more people were aware of/had more knowledge of? 

A: Black History Month began in February 1926 as Negro History Week (https://nyti.ms/3Xz71IU), an initiative by writer and historian (and founder of the Journal of Negro History and the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, or ASALH) Carter G. Woodson. Woodson believed that education and awareness of history were the only ways to achieve equity and equality across society.

FACT SHEET - Libby Dam

PRINT | E-MAIL
Libby Dam is a vital component in the region’s ability to provide environmental sustainability, national energy independence, protection of public safety and infrastructure, and economic well-being.  The construction and operation of Libby Dam was authorized by Congress as part of the Columbia River Treaty in 1964, and is the only U.S. dam among the four storage dams constructed in the headwaters of the Columbia River system under the Treaty, making it the only Corps-operated facility in the nation to have both upstream and downstream international impacts.  When the Treaty was originally drafted in the 1960s, it was designed to optimize hydropower production and coordinate flood risk management as its two primary benefits. Since that time, the region has come to increasingly recognize and value the importance of the Basin’s ecosystem. 
The Treaty is now under review (as required) - with 50 years having passed since it was signed by the U.S. and Canada - and a draft recommendation by the U.S. Entity was developed with input from sovereigns and stakeholders through an extensive, multi-year process in collaboration with the Sovereign Review Team, comprised of designated representatives of the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, 10 federal agencies, and 15 Native American Tribes.  Equally critical to the Treaty Review and development of the draft recommendation has been the extensive involvement and input of the region’s stakeholders.  Libby Dam has been a focal point for stakeholders of all levels during the Treaty Review process. 
Background
Libby Dam spans the Kootenai River 17 miles upstream from the town of Libby in the heart of northwestern Montana.  The Corps began construction of Libby Dam in 1966 and completed the structure in 1972, with the first commercial power coming on-line on August 29, 1975.  By March 1976, three more units were put on-line, and the fifth unit was finished in 1984.  While the main purpose of Libby Dam is flood risk management (to control the devastating floods of the Kootenai River and to provide 5.8 million acre feet of storage), the dam and reservoir also serve the multiple purposes of hydropower, recreation, navigation, and environmental stewardship.  Frequently, the needs of each of these project purposes conflict with one another, which requires careful balancing to ensure that as many needs as possible are met.
Libby Dam is a straight-axis, concrete, gravity structure solidly anchored in bedrock. It was constructed with 7.6 million tons of concrete and holds back the water of the Kootenai River with its own massive weight.  The dam is 422 feet tall and 3,055 feet long. The Kootenai River is the third largest tributary to the Federal Columbia River Power System, contributing almost 20 percent of the total water in the lower Columbia.  Libby Dam backs up the Kootenai River to form Lake Koocanusa, extending 90 miles upstream, making it the seventh largest reservoir in the United States.  Forty-two miles of Lake Koocanusa are in British Columbia, Canada.
Water from Lake Koocanusa passes through 17 Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) dams prior to reaching the Pacific Ocean, of which Libby Dam is the first. Because Libby Dam is the first dam in the system, it is used to store water for use during peak power needs, as well as water for use during spring for sturgeon spawning, and during summer and fall for anadromous fish migration downstream in the mainstem of the Columbia River.
Libby Dam operations must take into account two Biological Opinions for endangered species (Columbia River salmon and steelhead and Kootenai River white sturgeon and bull trout). Libby Dam also provides funding and management direction for Murray Springs Fish Hatchery near Eureka, Montana. The Corps provides funding to Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks to manage the hatchery, which rears and stocks trout into Lake Koocanusa and many other lakes in the area.
Lake Koocanusa and the Kootenai River offer abundant recreational opportunities in both Canada and the United States. The reservoir has several private marinas and many public boat ramps. Fishing and water sports are popular year-around activities. The Kootenai River has the reputation of being a blue ribbon fishery for rainbow trout, and there are several    private    outfitters    who    depend    on    the    river    for    their    livelihood.
Libby Dam is also known for other recreational opportunities, including camping, wildlife viewing, picnicking and boating, and the ever-popular interpretive tour of the dam. While Libby Dam's project lands have a smaller footprint in acreage compared to some, we boast an innovative and forward-looking interpretive and recreational program that is well-rounded and serves an average of 175,000 visitors per year.  Libby Dam leads local tourism efforts through connections to regional tourism - increasing collateral value and boosting the local economy through multiple pioneering partnerships - which enriches all mission and program areas at Libby Dam.  We lead the nation in educating the rest of the Corps about leveraging those partnerships in innovative ways.

Megawatt-Hours generated by Libby Dam vary by water year.  In Fiscal Year 2019 Libby Dam generated – 161,51,000 mwhs with an estimated market value of up to $57,322,000 (using historical monthly market prices.)
Recreation economic benefits to local economy: camping, fishing, public education and safety.
Libby Dam provides personnel for three flood teams that cover all the drainages in Montana, west of the Continental Divide and Northern Idaho.
The Murray Springs hatchery (owned by USACE) produces triploid (sterile) Gerrard rainbow trout for the reservoir; sexually sterile fish do not reproduce, and thus divert that energy into growth. The target Gerrard rainbow trout fishery in Koocanusa is considered a “trophy fishery” due to the potential maximum sizes attained by these fish – 10 to 25 pounds.
95,593 fish were stocked in this year from this hatchery.

Visitation - In fiscal year 2019 Libby Dam hosted 185,000 visitors.

Salal Dam (Hindi: सलाल बाँध Salāl Bāndh), also known as Salal Hydroelectric Power Station, is a run-of-the-river hydropower project on the Chenab River in the Reasi district of the Jammu and Kashmir.[1] It was the first hydropower project built by India in Jammu and Kashmir under the Indus Water Treaty regime.[2] After having reached a bilateral agreement with Pakistan in 1978,[3] with significant concessions made to Pakistan in the design of the dam, reducing its height, eliminating operating pool, and plugging the under-sluices meant for sediment management, India completed the project in 1987. The concessions made in the interest of bilateralism damaged the long-term sustainability of the dam, which silted up in five years. It currently runs at 57% capacity factor.[note 1] Its long-term future is uncertain.[4][5][6]
Conception[edit]
The project is located on the Chenab River near the Salal village in the Reasi District, a few kilometres south of Matlot where the river turns to a southerly course. Pakistan's Marala Headworks is 72 km (45 mi) downstream, from where the Marala–Ravi Link Canal and the Upper Chenab Canal carry water to various parts of Pakistani Punjab.[7]
The Salal project was conceived in 1920. Feasibility studies on the project commenced in 1961 by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir and a project design was readied by 1968.[8] Construction was started in 1970 by the Central Hydroelectric Project Control Board (under the Government of India's Ministry of Irrigation and Power). The design of the project contained a two-stage powerhouse generating 690 MW power making use of the head created by the dam.[7]
Indus waters dispute[edit]
Under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the Chenab River is allocated to Pakistan for exploitation (one of the 'Western Rivers' – Indus, Jhelum and Chenab). India has rights to use the river for ""non-consumptive"" uses such as power generation. India is obliged under the treaty to inform Pakistan of its intent to build a project six months prior to construction and take into account any concerns raised by the latter.[8]
Since Pakistan lost the three eastern rivers to India by the treaty, its dependence on the Chenab river increased. It viewed the Salal project with great concern. Even limited storage in a relatively low dam upstream was viewed as a flood risk, even a threat, whereby India could flood Pakistan's farm lands by a sudden release of water. Equally, India could hold back water in its reservoir starving them of water. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, foreign minister and later prime minister, argued that the dam could be used strategically as an instrument of war to bog down Pakistan's armour. After the two wars of 1965 and 1971, all such theories were easily believable.[8][9][10]
During the negotiations, Pakistan raised technical objections to the design and capacity of the dam. It argued that the 40-foot gates on the spillways gave the dam more storage than allowed by the treaty. It also argued that the under-sluices included for sediment clearing were not permitted under the treaty.[11][note 2] Indians argued that the flood risk that Pakistanis expressed was unreasonable. Any intention on India's part to flood Pakistan would involve causing much more damage to its own territory.[11] In the face of Pakistan's unwillingness to relent, the Indian negotiators wanted to take it to arbitration by a neutral expert, as provided for in the treaty.[14]
However, after signing the 1972 Simla Agreement with Pakistan, India wanted to steer the relations towards bilateralism. Its foreign policy establishment ruled out going to a neutral expert. In further bilateral talks in October 1976, India made significant concessions in the dam's height and other issues. An agreement was reached in 1977, but deferred till after the elections in Pakistan. Soon afterwards, change of government occurred in both India and Pakistan, but the understanding survived.[note 3]
A formal agreement was signed in Delhi on 12 April 1978 by Indian foreign minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistan's foreign secretary Agha Shahi.[15][16] The height of spillway gates was reduced from 40 ft to 30 ft. The under-sluices designed for sediment management were permanently plugged.[17][18] The agreement was hailed as a triumph of bilateralism, facilitating an atmosphere of trust and confidence between the two countries.[11][19] But the agreement also seriously damaged the sustainability of the dam and the Indian engineers viewed it as too high a price to pay for bilateralism.[20]
Final construction[edit]
Spillway at the top of the Concrete Dam
After signing the agreement in 1978, the construction of the project was entrusted to National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) on an agency basis.[21] NHPC was incorporated by the Government of India in 1975, with an authorised capital of Rs. 200 crore. The Salal project was its first project.[22]
The Stage-I of the powerhouse was commissioned in 1987; Stage-II between 1993 and 1995. The final commissioning of the project took place in 1996.[21]
Salal power Station
After completion, the Salal project was transferred to NHPC on an ownership basis.[22] The Government of Jammu and Kashmir is said to have had a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of India to receive the project at a depreciated cost.[23] However, according to the National Conference party, the coalition government in power at 1985, run by the Ghulam Mohammad Shah-wing of the National Conference and the Indian National Congress, surrendered the state's rights over the project.[24]
The state of Jammu and Kashmir receives 12.5 percent of the energy generated from the project.[25] The rest is transmitted to the Northern Grid where it is distributed to the states of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. Jammu and Kashmir also purchases additional power at regular prices.[24][26]
Siltation[edit]
Sediment is a serious problem among Himalayan rivers (since the Himalayas are young mountains).[27] The Chenab river, especially, carries more silt than the others even among the 'Western Rivers'. Its annual silt load is estimated to be 32,000,000 m3 (26,000 acre⋅ft).[28]
The silted reservoir, with the crest of the dam to the right
From the very first year of operation, the reservoir of the Salal dam started silting up. Two severe floods in 1988 and 1992 further accelerated the siltation.[29] Within five years, the reservoir got silted up almost entirely.[30] As a result, the reservoir capacity got reduced from the intended 231,000 acre⋅ft (285,000,000 m3) to 7,000 acre⋅ft (9,000,000 m3).[29]
As per the 1978 Salal agreement, the reservoir had to be maintained at Constant Full Reservoir Level at 487.68 m asl. Six under-sluices that were provided during the construction had to be plugged at the beginning of operation. Consequently, the 9.14 m (30 ft) high spillway gates form the only live storage of the reservoir. The rest is dead storage, which ended up acting as a siltation tank.[31] To alleviate the problem, the spillway gates are being opened at least once a month during the monsoon season as a desilting mechanism, with a discharge of about 4,250 cumecs. This is reported to have recovered some of the reservoir capacity, increasing it to 10,000 acre⋅ft (12,000,000 m3).[32]
As the spillway and the power intake are continuously passing sand, they cause abrasion damage to the spillway concrete structure and the turbine equipment.[33] Studies report erosion in the civil structures such as the concrete sill of the spillway, the glacis and the bucket;[34] damage to the turbine components such as cracks in the turbine blades, knife edging of the outer edges and washing out of other components;[35] damage to the cooling system such as tubes being choked with stator faults encountered.[35] NHPC has been using various technical remedies to address these problems.[36]
The silt accumulation has essentially converted the reservoir into an elevated river bed.[28] The situation is reported to be alarming and the future of the project uncertain.[5] ""During winters when water level goes abysmally down, it does not generate much [power],"" according to a state official.[4] In 2014–2015, the two powerhouses reported producing 3491 million KWH,[37] representing 57% capacity factor.[note 1]
Technical parameters[edit]
Penstocks, used to move gushing water from dam to turbine
The original Indian design provided for a 130-metre-high dam up to an elevation of 1,627 ft above sea level, a 40 ft gated spillway at the top (between elevations 1,560–1,600 ft) and 6 under-sluices at elevation 1,365 ft.[3] The under-sluices would have enabled the 'drawdown flushing' of sediments.[note 4] However, at Pakistan's insistence, the under-sluices were permanently plugged with concrete, and the gates were reduced from 40 ft to 30 ft. This meant that the only live storage is between elevations 1,570–1,600 ft, and the storage below that level has gotten silted up, forming an elevated river bed. The level of the bed now varies between 477 m (1,565 ft) and 484 m (1,588 ft).[39]

a b At full capacity, a power station generates 8.76 million units (kWh) per megawatt of installed capacity. In early 1990s, Chenab projects produced 6.93 million units per installed MW. In 2012–13, Salal produced only 4.74 million units,[38] with a small improvement to 5.06 million units in 2014–15.
^ The Indus Waters Treaty actually states (Annexure D, Paragraph 8): ""There shall be no outlets below the Dead Storage Level, unless necessary for sediment control or any other technical purpose; any such outlet shall be of the minimum size, and located at the highest level, consistent with the sound and economical design and with satisfactory operation of the works.""[12][13]
^ In Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq came to power overthrowing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government. In India, the Janata Party won the elections in 1977.
^ Drawdown flushing is a technique of sediment management, whereby the reservoir is drawn down to some level above that of under-sluices (""minimum drawdown level"") before a flooding season. The gates of the spillway are kept open as the flood arrives, allowing it to wash away settled sediment.[13]

Akselos to create world’s first structural digital twin of hydroelectric power station
Akselos has been selected for a pilot project with Irish electricity company, ESB, to create a structural digital twin of ESB’s Turlough Hill hydroelectric power station in County Wicklow.
The project aims to increase the sustainability of this unique asset with a full assessment of the hydro structure, to help extend its operational life to beyond the intended design life. This will help ESB achieve smarter asset management as part of its continued commitment to delivering low carbon energy solutions.
ESB has entered into pilot projects with a total of five international energy start-ups, all finalists in this year’s Free Electrons Accelerator Programme of which ESB is a founding member. The programme is designed to support start-ups who are working to transform the energy market with next-generation ideas. ESB and nine other global utilities work with each of the start-ups to refine and test their products with the potential to reach 80 million customers in more than 40 countries.
Andrew Young, VP of Projects, Akselos, said: “We are very excited to work with ESB to deliver the world’s first PHYSICS-BASED DIGITAL TWIN of a hydroelectric pump station. I believe Akselos will be able to deliver significant value to Turlough Hill by enabling operations beyond its design life. We have already delivered positive results in the short time we have been working on the project with the delivery of a digital twin of the penstock and manifold. THE HYDROELECTRIC PLANT IS STRATEGIC FOR ESB’S GRID STABILIZATION plan going to 2050 and beyond, and Akselos is able to complement traditional engineering with the latest innovation in technology.”
Akselos brings next generation simulation technology to the market, the first of its kind to be powerful enough to create holistic, real-time digital twins of large, complex assets. The sensor-enabled digital twin responds in real time to reflect the asset’s current condition, enabling active control of asset integrity and operations.
Denis O’Leary, ESB’s Head of Innovation, says: “ESB is delighted to partner with five of the world’s most exciting and innovative energy start-ups as part of the hugely successful Free Electrons Programme. This once again demonstrates the organisation’s commitment to supporting the brightest talent that are developing energy solutions for our customers. These are important steps as we lead the transition to a low-carbon future, with creative ideas, innovative thinking and new technologies at the heart of this transformation.”

ENERGY
A Perspective on Hydro Power
JULY 12, 2019  • JOSH MCGHEE
An intern’s research on transitioning toward a more sustainable hydro future: Climate change has the potential to impact all aspects of life, including health, agriculture, and our GDP. We’ve had ample warnings – from the National Climate Assessment the US Government released last year, to the UN IPCC 1.5◦ report. The time has come for a serious, practical transition to clean energy that is both reliable and environmentally conscious.
Over the last century, hydropower technology has helped build out our society through the deployment of dams, particularly across the west. Hydropower relies on flowing water to propel a turbine, and so creates carbon-free electricity, although the reservoirs that dams rely on do produce large amounts of methane. Dams need a lot of cement to be built at large scales, and the use of cement is the third largest anthropogenic source of CO2. Additionally, the biological and riparian elements of rivers downstream of dams are often negatively impacted. Fish can be displaced, leading to species degradation and loss, and lack of river flow can cause sediment to build up.
These issues tie into the economic effects laid out in the National Climate Assessment. If fish aren’t populating as well, and agricultural land isn’t getting the runoff from rivers that it needs, it can harm the economy and hurt businesses. Since dams can cause damage to the environment and create issues downstream, what is an environmentally viable alternative that can still produce clean electricity for the grid?
Run-of-the-river dams could be an alternative. This technology essentially diverts the flow of the river to propel a turbine but does not make use of reservoirs to hold the water and prevent it from continuing downstream. While it is subject to seasonal flows, making it more of an intermittent energy source, it has proven to be much more environmentally friendly. By funneling the water through a small pipe next to the river and returning it back downstream, run-of-the-river technology prevents sediment build up, allows fish to spawn at natural rates, and has a smaller operational cost than dams.
It is clear that we cannot divert all of our resources away from dams to keep up with ever-growing energy demands. However, by retrofitting existing dams that are not currently in use, building new small hydro projects, such as run-of-the-river, and cutting down on the reliance of fossil fuels, run-of-the-river dams might provide a more sustainable way to increase the supply of renewable energy in the energy transition. Policymakers and engineers can manufacture efficient ways to modernize our current infrastructure to meet at the intersection of conservation and energy development. Here’s to hoping compromise is found.
Josh McGhee served as the Aspen Institute Energy and Environment Program Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 Intern.  This blog was the culmination of his research on hydro power during his time as an intern. Prior to his internship at the Aspen Institute, Josh served as a Fellow in the Piedmont Environmental Council and as a Federal Affairs Intern at the Wildlife Conservation Society. He is currently a graduate student at the University of Maryland and a Public Policy Intern at the legal firm Squire Patton Boggs.

Niagara Falls National Heritage Area
Quick Facts
LOCATION: Niagara Falls, Lewiston, and Porter, NY
SIGNIFICANCE: The Niagara Falls National Heritage Area, is a collection of one city, two towns, two villages, a host of parks, sites and attractions along the Niagara River. The “Falls to Fort” region offers the world-famous Niagara Falls, a variety of heritage tourism activities, quaint village shops and restaurants, a downtown tourism area and a variety of outdoor activities including boating, fishing and hiking. From the War of 1812 to its role as a nexus in the Underground Railroad and a catalyst of the hydroelectric power, Niagara has been and continues to be of critical importance. Today, over 8 million people visit the oldest state park in the United States yearly to gaze at the mighty waters of Niagara Falls. Representing 20% of the world’s fresh water, the importance of Niagara continues to be “key to the whole continent.”
DESIGNATION: National Heritage Area
The mission of the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area (NFNHA) is to preserve, protect, and promote the historic, natural, and cultural resources of the area stretching from Niagara Falls to Old Fort Niagara.

The Niagara Falls region has significant historical associations with American Indians, early European exploration, the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Underground Railroad. The Falls have long been an important site for hydroelectric power and ancillary industries. Together, these elements have contributed to Niagara Falls' importance in the American imagination, as a national landmark, and a symbol of the American conservation movement.

The work of the NFNHA is to enhance public appreciation for the communities, significant historic and natural resources, and landscapes of the Niagara region. The NFNHA works through a network of heritage area partners who seek to make interpretive, environmental, economic, and social improvements that benefit residents and visitors alike.

The NFNHAa’s Discover Niagara Shuttle is a convenient transportation service that operates May to September. The shuttle serves to more than 15 destination stops along the 14-mile route from ""the Falls to the Fort, allowing visitors to experience Niagara’s iconic landscape, rich history, and the thriving culture and communities along the scenic Niagara River, all with the ease and convenience of a hop-on/hop-off shuttle.

Executive Summary
Hydropower is a method of generating electricity that uses moving water (kinetic energy) to produce electricity. In large-scale hydropower plants the moving water drives large water turbines, and dams are needed to store water in lakes, reservoirs and rivers for later release. Stored water can be used for power generation as well as irrigation, industrial, or domestic use. While hydropower is considered a clean and reliable energy source in many countries, it has significant environmental and social impacts. The creation of a reservoir often leads to large amounts of methane production, a potent greenhouse gas. Dams also have a large impact on local wildlife, ecosystems and lead to displacement of local residents. Nowadays, the hydropower industry is investing in research and mitigation projects to reduce the adverse environmental effects dams can have on water quality, river flows and fish habitats.
Advantages
Large-scale hydropower is a renewable energy source.
Although hydropower systems cost a lot to build, they have very low maintenance costs and can last for over 100 years.
Water can be stored above dams so power can be produced when it is needed.
Disadvantages
As reservoirs require large areas, finding a suitable place for large-scale hydropower plants can be difficult.
Reservoirs have multiple social and environmental effects (ecosystem damage, loss of land, siltation, methane production, displacement of people, failure risks, and water loss via evaporation).
Hydropower sites are often located in remote areas, so electricity distribution costs can be high, and there can be significant losses in the distribution grid.

Introduction
Factsheet Block Body
While water resources are valued for sustaining human health and food production, the energy contained in moving water such as rivers or tides can also be harnessed to create energy through hydropower or mechanical uses. Hydropower schemes can either be small scale or large-scale, depending on the local conditions and the energy demand. Globally, 1.4 billion people lack access to electricity, with an additional 1 billion having only intermittent access (UNDP 2012). Where water resources permit, large-scale hydropower is an option to produce large quantities of renewable, inexpensive energy to meet growing energy demands in the face of rising costs of fossil fuels. Today, it is a widely used technology that is applied to produce power in many different ways.
How Does it Work?
Factsheet Block Body
Regardless of size, the principle behind hydropower generation is the same: that the power of moving water can be harnessed to produce energy. The key elements for hydropower generation are “head” and “flow.” “Head” refers to the height of the gradient over which the water falls, while “flow” refers to the volume of water per unit time. To maximise energy production, both head and flow should be high. In other words, greater amounts of energy are generated when a large volume of water flows quickly over a steep gradient. Hydropower plants generate electricity by directing water through a turbine, which in turn drives an electric generator. The large quantity of electricity produced in large-scale hydropower is usually fed into an electricity grid.
Classification
Factsheet Block Body
Adapted from SINGH (2009)
Hydropower plants are classified according to their energy production capacity, expressed in megawatts. Large-scale hydropower plants can produce well over 100 MW, while small hydropower plants generally produce less than 10 MW. The main difference between the six different sizes ranges of hydropower plants is determined by the amount of civil infrastructure work involve during the construction. Whereas a large facility producing a great amount of electricity involves damming huge rivers and building powerhouses, smaller hydropower schemes utilise the difference in altitude, small flows or the decline in the pipes from water infrastructure to provide power for small communities.

Large-Scale Hydropower Plants
Factsheet Block Body
Adapted from US DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR (2005)
Large-scale hydropower is a form of renewable energy generation derived from flowing water used to drive large water turbines. In order to generate large amounts of hydroelectricity for cities, lakes, reservoirs and dams are needed to store and regulate water for later release for power generation, irrigation, domestic (see PPT) or industrial (see PPT) use. Since large-scale hydropower facilities can easily be turned on and off, hydropower is more reliable than most other energy sources for meeting electricity peak demands throughout the day.
There are several types of large-scale hydropower plants, which can be classified as:
Conventional hydroelectric dams
Pumped-storage
Run-of-the-river
Tidal
 Conventional Hydroelectric Dams
Adapted from US DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR (2005)
In order to generate electricity, a large-scale hydropower (LHP) plant uses the kinetic (moving) energy of water in lakes or reservoirs. The water flows through a penstock, which channels the water to the turbine. When flowing water turns a turbine, its kinetic energy is converted to mechanical (machine) energy. The turbine turns the generator rotor, which then converts this mechanical energy into electricity. After the water has flowed through the turbine blades, the water is released for such purposes as irrigation, domestic and industrial use or to generate electricity again in another hydroelectric power plant located downstream. 
Hydropower – how it works. Source: US DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR (2005)            
 Often, dams are located in isolated locations and therefore vast networks of transmission lines and facilities are used to bring electricity to homes, schools, factories and offices. Due to the long distances involved in transmitting this electricity, there are often large losses within the distribution network.

 Pumped-Storage
Pumped storage is a method of keeping water in reserve for peak period power demands. During the night, water is pumped from a low lake to a storage pool above the power plant at a time when customer demand for energy is low, and electricity is cheaper. The water is then released through the turbine-generators at times when demand is high and a heavy load is place on the system (adapted from US DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR (2005)).
 Run-of-the-River
Another type of large-scale hydropower plant is the run-of-the-river hydroelectricity. Run-of-river systems do not rely on large storage reservoirs, but rather divert river water to drive turbines, and then discharge the water back into the river system. These hydropower schemes are most often used for micro and small scale hydropower, but can also be large-scale projects (adapted from US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (2005)).
 Tidal
Tidal power is a method of large-scale hydropower that uses the motion of the ocean’s tides to generate electricity. There are two types of tidal power: tidal range and tidal stream. Tidal range systems trap huge volumes of water in a large basin and when then drains through a tidal estuary to drive water turbines built into a dam. Tidal streams are built in narrow channels around headlands. The energy produced by fast flowing tidal currents can be harnessed by using underwater turbines that are fixed on the seabed or estuary floor (adapted from RWE (2012)).
Environmental and Social Aspects
Factsheet Block Body
While large-scale hydropower can provide large quantities of reliable, relatively inexpensive electricity, there are significant environmental and social consequences, namely:
Ecosystem damage and loss of land. The damming of rivers and creation of reservoirs strongly disrupts stream ecosystem habitats and breeding cycles of fish species. As a reservoir is created, large areas of land are flooded, representing a loss of this land for other purposes such as settlement, farming, or as a natural ecosystem.
Siltation and flow shortage. As river water flows, it naturally carries silt, which is normally transported downstream and deposited once water velocity slows. However, when rivers are dammed, this process is disrupted and silt is deposited in the reservoir instead of downstream. This can cause reservoirs to fill up with sediment and lose their ability to control floods, or can cause dams to break, flooding huge areas of land.
Methane emissions. As reservoirs are created, large areas of land are flooded. Once underwater, organic material contained in soil or decaying plants begins to degrade anaerobically, causing methane production, which is a potent greenhouse gas (see climate change). In instances where the reservoir is large compared to the energy generation of the power plant, hydropower plants can produce more greenhouse gases than fossil fuel power plants. Clearing of forests before flooding and minimising the area of flooding can reduce methane emissions (LIMA et al. 2008). 
Displacement of people. The large amount of flooding in creating a reservoir necessitates the displacement of any people who work or live near the site of the hydropower plant. In February 2008, an estimated 40-80 million people were displaced due to dam construction, causing loss of homes as well as loss of livelihood (INTERNATIONAL RIVERS 2008). To learn more about political and social conflicts between water users, read about water conflicts.
Failure risks. If dams are poorly constructed or are the site of natural disasters, they can break and cause dam failure. This releases an enormous quantity of stored water, causing catastrophic damage to downstream settlements and infrastructure. With respect to damage and loss of life, dam failures have been among the largest man-made disasters in history.
Water loss via evaporation. Reservoirs create large pools of water with a large surface area. This leads to high amounts of evaporation, where water is lost from the reservoir into the atmosphere before it has gone through turbines to generate energy. This evaporation leads to huge water losses. This means that, in areas where water is scarce, large-scale hydropower may be a very inefficient use of water resources.
 All of the above concerns should be taken into consideration when designing and implementing new hydropower plants. Dams built with mitigation measures and adequate site selection techniques can provide benefits to local populations, whereas those build without proper mitigation techniques, compensation measures and site selection evaluations criteria will have considerable adverse environmental effects. For example, the 500–megawatt Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project in Chile flooded only about 400 hectares of land (with minimal damage to forest or wildlife resources) and has had no water quality problems. By contrast, the Brokopondo Dam in Suriname inundated about 160,000 hectares of biologically valuable tropical rainforest and is known for serious water quality and aquatic weed problems, while providing relatively little electric generating capacity (only 30 megawatts) (LEDEC AND QUINTERO 2003).
Cost
Factsheet Block Body
The cost of large-scale hydropower plants is imposed by the natural setting, the capacity of the hydropower plant, and size of urban centres. It is estimated that 65-75% of total costs are related to civil engineering, 15-20% for meeting environmental regulations, and the remaining 10% for the turbine, generator, and control systems. The total cost of a hydropower scheme depends on the head of the system, and can range from $8000-$13000 USD per kW for a low-head system, and $4500-$9500 UDS per kW for a medium-head system (LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION 2012).
Despite the high cost of installation, large hydroelectric power plants produce electricity at low costs, especially to large urban centres (LEDEC AND QUINTERO 2003). Considering fuel, operation, and maintenance, large-scale hydropower is much less expensive than many other energy sources, including nuclear, fossil fuels, and gas turbines. On average, hydropower in the U.S. produces energy for less than $0.01 per kilowatt-hour (US DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR 2005). Because of this inexpensive energy generation, in spite of the high amounts of environmental remediation that are often associated with dams and reservoirs, large-scale hydropower can still be a cost effective energy source compared to fossil fuels (WILLIAMS & PORTER 2006).
Operation and Maintenance
Factsheet Block Body
Large-scale power plants are expensive to build but they have very low maintenance costs. However, the operation and maintenance has to be done by highly skilled professionals in order to ensure the safety of dams. This is mainly because most of operations has been optimised with the use of computer technologies (adapted from US DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR (2005)).
Applicability
Adapted from WILLIAMS AND PORTER (2006) and COLLIER (2004)
Worldwide, many countries depend on large hydropower plants to secure their energy supply. Nowadays, hydropower currently provides 16.3 % of the worlds electricity supply and there is still considerable untapped potential in many areas of the world. To minimise the adverse environmental and social effects of this technology, energy planners should apply better decision-making process with affected population (according to the recommendations of the World Commission on Dams), to better select sites and apply more effective mitigation measures. Furthermore, more comprehensive and exhaustive assessments need to be undertaken, giving equal weighting on environmental and social factors and not only considering economical and financial ones.

Hydropower (Small-scale)
Author/Compiled by

Executive Summary
Hydropower is a method of generating electricity that uses moving water (kinetic energy) to produce electricity. Small-scale hydropower has been used as a common way of generating electricity in isolated regions since end of 19th century. Small-scale hydropower systems can be installed in small rivers, streams or in the existing water supply networks, such as drinking water or wastewater networks. In contrast with large-scale hydropower systems, small-scale hydropower can be installed with little or negligible environmental impact on wildlife or ecosystems, mainly because the majority of small hydropower plants are run-of-river schemes or implemented in existing water infrastructure. Due to its versatility, low investment costs, and as a renewable energy source, small-scale hydropower is a promising option for producing sustainable, inexpensive energy in rural or developing areas.
Advantages
Small-scale hydropower is a clean energy source, producing no water or air pollution
As a non-consumptive water use, small hydropower is a renewable energy source
There is minimal impact on the environment
As no reservoirs are created, small hydropower does not cause the problems associated with reservoirs such as methane emissions, displacement of people, sedimentation, and disrupted stream dynamics (see factsheets on large-scale hydropower and man-made reservoirs to find out more)
Disadvantages
To be economical, energy consumers need to be located near the hydropower scheme, thus limiting the application of small-scale hydropower to streamside communities
The stream flow limits the power generation. Every small hydropower plant has a maximum capacity, determined by the stream flow, which cannot be exceeded
Seasonal variation in stream flow causes variation and disturbance in energy supply. Advanced planning is needed to ensure adequate energy generation throughout the year, especially in areas with a significant dry season

As running water is a resource that is globally available and renewable, harnessing its power to generate electricity can provide a sustainable source of energy to improve livelihoods and increase working productivity. Particularly in rural or developing areas, small-scale hydropower can represent a locally available, reliable source of energy where no other energy generation is feasible.

Adapted from SINGH (2009) and GAIUS-OBASEKI (2010)
Hydropower plants are classified according to their energy production capacity, expressed in megawatts. While large scale hydropower plants can produce well over 100 MW, small hydropower plants generally produce less than 10 MW. Based on energy production capacity, small-scale hydropower production is broken into four size categories of pico- (<5 kilowatts), micro- (5-100 kW), mini- 100 kW-1 MW), and small (1-10 MW).
However, classifications vary from country to country as there is currently no common consensus among countries and hydropower associations regarding the upper limit of small-scale hydropower plant capacity. For instance, some European Union countries like Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Greece and Belgium accept 10 MW as the upper limit for small-scale hydropower installed capacity, while others place the maximum capacity from 3 to 1.5 MW. Outside the EU, this limit can be much higher, as in the USA (30 MW) and India (25 MW).

Types of Small Hydropower Schemes
Factsheet Block Body
Because hydropower generation depends on only two factors (water flow and head) to produce energy, small-scale hydropower can be implemented in any system where these factors are met. This can include natural systems such as streams or rivers, but can also include any water network where pipes provide water flow over a decline (head). Hydropower can therefore also be integrated into many stages of the drinking water or wastewater network (KUCUKALI 2011). Most small hydropower schemes fit into two main categories: run-of-river systems, or integrated in existing water infrastructure.
 Run-of-River Schemes
Adapted from SINGH (2009)
In run-of-river systems, river water is diverted by a weir through an opening in the river side (the ‘intake’) into a channel. A settling basin is built in to the channel to remove sand and silt from the water. The channel follows the contour of the area so as to preserve the elevation of the diverted water. The channel directs the water into a small reservoir/tank known as the ‘forebay’ from where it is directed on to the turbines through a closed pipe known as the ‘penstock’. The penstock essentially directs the water in a uniform stream to the turbine at a lower level. The turning shaft of the turbine can be used to rotate a mechanical device (such as a grinding mill, oil expeller, or wood lathe), or to operate an electricity generator. When electricity is generated, the ‘power house’ where the generator is located, transfers the electricity to a step-up ‘transformer’ which is then transmitted to the grid sub-station or to the village/area where this electricity is to be used. Once electricity is produced, the water flow is returned back to the river. For this reason, small hydropower plants are considered a renewable, non-polluting and environmentally source of energy.
Typical run-of-river scheme. Source: PRACTICAL ACTION (n.y.) 
 Most small hydropower plants are “run-of-river” schemes. The power is generated only when enough water is available from the river/stream. When the stream/river flow reduces below the design flow value, the generation ceases, as the water does not flow through the intake structure into the turbines.
 Integrated in Existing Water Infrastructure
Small-scale hydropower plants within existing water infrastructure have four main advantages compared to those which utilise rivers and streams (KUCUKALI 2011):
All civil works are already present, which can reduce the investment cost for new infrastructure by about 50%.
Facilities have no significant environmental impacts, and will have a guaranteed discharge (and production rate) throughout the year.
The generated electricity can be used in the water supply system, with excess electricity sold to the government.
There will be no land acquisition or significant operating costs.
 Small-scale hydropower can be implemented in the following ways within existing drinking water or wastewater infrastructure (SAN BRUNO et al. 2010):
Within a drinking water network: Excess pressure in pipes is used to generate hydropower by replacing pressure breakers with turbines.
Within an irrigation network: Implementation is similar to within a water supply network, but special considerations need to be taken to produce energy outside the irrigation season.
Before wastewater treatment: Wastewater is diverted through a turbine before it enters a wastewater treatment plant. A trash rack should be installed to remove solids before wastewater passes through the turbine.
After wastewater treatment: Before being discharged to the environment, wastewater is passed through a turbine to generate electricity.
Within a runoff collection system: Implementation is similar to within a water supply network, but consideration needs to be taken to remove particles that may be suspended in stormwater before it passes through the turbine.
On a reserved flow or compensation discharge: In large hydropower schemes or in water works, water is often discharged according to national laws. A turbine can be installed to generate hydropower from this discharge.
On a fish pass system: In order for fish to migrate past obstacles such as dams, a fish pass systems are often installed. To allow fish to find the pass, an “attraction discharge” is necessary. A turbine placed at this discharge can make use of the difference in water level between the upstream basin and fish pass entrance to generate hydropower.
In a navigation lock or dam: Locks and dams regulate water levels. Turbines can be installed that utilise fluctuating water levels for hydropower generation during the filling and emptying of the locks.
In a desalination plant: The process of reverse osmosis to separate water from dissolved salts through semi-permeable membranes necessitates high pressures (from 40 to 80 bars). The high-pressure residue of liquid water containing salt can be passed through a turbine in order to recover part of the energy used for the initial compression.
In a cooling or heating system: Cooling or heating systems can produce excess pressure that can be recovered by hydro-turbines to produce energy.
  How to Optimise?
Factsheet Block Body
Hydropower is a non-consumptive water use. Therefore, there are possibilities to link hydropower to other uses, such as irrigation in agriculture. This can reduce the investment costs for individual users, thus expanding the possibilities for income generation and development.
Water for Energy and the Millennium Development Goals
Factsheet Block Body
Adapted from UN-HABITAT (2012)
Because of their geographical versatility and relatively low investment costs, the development of small hydropower could be key in spreading access to electricity in rural and developing areas. Access to electricity can have many positive development impacts, which can be regarded for each of the Millennium Development Goals.
Goal
Impact
Goal 1: Eradication extreme poverty and hunger
Energy inputs such as electricity and fuels are essential to generate jobs, industrial activities, transportation, commerce and micro-enterprises. 
Almost all staple foods must be cooked, requiring heat and fuels to be compatible with human nutrition.
Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education
To attract teachers, electricity is needed for homes and schools. After dark study requires illumination. Many children, especially girls, do not attend school in order to carry wood and water to wood and other energy sources to meet the family’s energy needs.
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women
Adult women are responsible for the majority of household cooking and water boiling activities. This takes time away form other productive activities. With modern fuels, stoves and mechanical power for food processing and transportation, women’s time would be freed up for more productive uses.
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
Diseases caused by lack of clean boiled water and respiratory illness caused by the effects of indoor air pollution from traditional fuels and stoves, directly contribute to infant and child disease and mortality.
Goal 5: Improve maternal health
Lack of electricity in health clinics, illumination for night-time deliveries and the physical burden of fuel collection and transport by pregnant women all contribute to poor maternal health conditions.
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
Electricity for communication of radio and television can foster the delivery of proper public health information to combat disease. Health care facilities require electricity for illumination, refrigeration and sterilisation to deliver effective health services.
Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Energy production, distribution and consumption has many adverse environmental effects at the local, regional and global levels including indoor air pollution in slum communities, land degradation and global warming. Cleaner energy systems are needed to address all of these for environmental sustainability.
Goal 8: Develop a Global Partnership for Development
The World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) called for partnerships between public entities, development agencies, civil society and the private sector to support sustainable development including the delivery of affordable, reliable and environmentally sustainable energy services.

Cost, Operation and Maintenance
Factsheet Block Body
The construction of small-scale hydropower systems depends on a number of variables such as site characteristics, power plant size, and location, with cost generally ranging from $1,000 - $20,000 USD/kW. Maintenance costs are relatively small in comparison to other technologies. Given a reasonable head, small-scale hydropower is a concentrated energy source. It is a long-lasting and robust technology, and the life of systems can be as long as 50 years or more without major new investments (SINGH 2009).
Assessments of the feasibility of small hydropower in rural areas have shown that even if population density is sparse, micro- and pico- hydropower may be cost-effective solutions due to the low cost of distribution and minimal effects on the environment (WILLIAMS & PORTER 2006). Integrating small-scale hydropower scheme as part of an existing water or sanitation infrastructure can reduce the investment costs while simultaneously producing valuable electricity that can be used by the facility or by an electricity grid.
Environmental and Social Aspects
Factsheet Block Body
As most small hydropower schemes are run-of-river or integrated within an already existing water infrastructure, the effect on the local environment is minimal. Run-of-river systems return water to streams, thus minimising the impact on stream ecosystems, while systems integrated into existing infrastructure merely make use of existing water flows.
Small hydropower is a non-polluting, renewable energy source. Unlike large hydropower schemes, small hydropower does not necessitate a reservoir, and therefore does not lead to methane production, a potent greenhouse gas.
Small hydropower schemes take up little space. Because no reservoir is created, there is minimal impact on nearby communities with respect to displacement.
  Applicability
Adapted from SINGH 2009
Small hydropower can provide clean, renewable, and relatively inexpensive energy. They can be constructed in any location where there is enough water flow and head to make energy generation viable, even in rural or undeveloped locations. This can include natural water sources such as streams and rivers, or existing manmade infrastructure such as water distribution networks, wastewater collection and treatment systems, and dams. In this way, small-scale hydropower can take advantage of current infrastructure to produce power and reduce the environmental impact (KUCUKALI 2011).

No. 3293.
February 15, 1938.
Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts; Hugh D. McLellan, Judge.
Bill in equity by the Holyoke Water Power Company against the American Writing Paper Company, Incorporated, to restrain an alleged abuse of certain water-power privileges. From a decree, 17 F. Supp. 895, dismissing the bill, the plaintiff appeals.
Affirmed.
Bentley W. Warren, of Boston, Mass. (Samuel Williston, of Cambridge, Mass., Nathan P. Avery and James M. Healy, both of Holyoke, Mass., and Donald C. Starr, of Boston, Mass., on the brief), for appellant.
Claude R. Branch, of Boston, Mass. (Charles P. Curtis, Jr., of Boston, Mass., Russell L. Davenport, of Holyoke, Mass., and Charles Ryan, of Boston, Mass., on the brief), for appellee.
Before BINGHAM, WILSON, and MORTON, Circuit Judges.
MORTON, Circuit Judge.
This case arises between the same parties, and involves the same water-power system and the same underlying contracts and leases, as were before this court in Holyoke Water Power Co. v. American Writing Paper Co., 90 F.2d 509, C.C.A.1. It is unnecessary to restate the facts. We held that the grants of mill powers ""carried a right to use the specified amount of water for power or other industrial uses."" Page 513. This conclusion was based on a very careful consideration of the history of the enterprise and the underlying grants, and we see no occasion to modify our views.
The questions now before us involve the rights of the defendant as owner or lessee in the use of certain millsites and mill powers originally granted by the plaintiff. The essential facts are simple. The defendant has installed on certain millsites hydroelectric generators driven by the mill powers appurtenant to such sites. The electric current so made is used for driving machinery located on other millsites than those on which the generators and water wheels stand. This the plaintiff contends the defendant has no right to do.
Some thirteen sites are involved and more than forty mill powers. While there is general similarity in the terms of the grants, they are not identical. In some of them it is expressly provided that the mill power shall be ""used only in and upon"" the specified millsite; in others, the same understanding may be inferred; all the mill powers are appurtenant to millsites. In the view which we take differences in the wording of the grants are not important. Taking the case in the aspect most favorable to the plaintiff, viz., that of a mill power granted as appurtenant to a given site with a proviso that the mill power shall be used only in and upon that site, may the defendant install hydroelectric machinery and use the current elsewhere?
At common law water powers have long been regarded as sui generis. As early as Luttrel's Case, 4 Coke 86, it was held that where a water power had been acquired by prescription the owner might thereafter use it as he saw fit; the same is true of water powers obtained under the mill acts. If the defendant is prohibited from using the mill powers in the way in which it is using them, the restriction must be found in the grants. Nowhere in any of the agreements and grants of the mill powers in question is there any restriction on such use, unless it is to be found in the provisions making each of the powers appurtenant to some site — which standing alone would certainly have no such effect — and requiring a power to be "" used only in and upon"" the site to which it is appurtenant. The plaintiff's case rests on the contention that the mill powers are not being ""used,"" within the meaning of the grants, on the site where the water wheels and generators are located, but on other sites where the electric current from the generator is applied to motors, to lights, or to other industrial uses.
When these grants were made, ""using"" a water power meant in common speech using it to run a water wheel. It is still the ordinary meaning of the phrase. ""The use of water for power according to common understanding means its application to a water wheel."" Holyoke Water Power Co. v. Whiting Co., 276 Mass. 528, 537, and 538, 177 N.E. 568, 572. In Utah Power Co. v. Pfost, 286 U.S. 165, 52 S.Ct. 548, 76 L.Ed. 1038, the plaintiff contended that its hydroelectric plant merely converted into electric energy the power of the falling water; that the stream of falling water continued, in effect, in the form of electricity across the state line; and that the state had therefore no right to tax it — a contention resembling the one now made. It was held untenable. The court said:
""Electrical energy has characteristics clearly differentiating it from the various other forms of energy, such as chemical energy, heat energy, and the energy of falling water. Appellant here, by means of what are called generators, converts the mechanical energy of falling water into electrical energy. Thus, by the application of human skill, a distinct product is brought into being and transmitted to the places of use. The result is not merely transmission; nor is it transmission of the mechanical energy of falling water to the places of consumption; but it is, first, conversion of that form of energy into something else, and, second, the transmission of that something else to the consumers. * * *
""We think, therefore, it is wholly inaccurate to say that appellant's entire system is purely a transferring device. On the contrary, the generator and the transmission lines perform different functions, with a result comparable, so far as the question here under consideration is concerned, to the manufacture of physical articles of trade and their subsequent shipment and transportation in commerce."" Sutherland, J., 286 U.S. 165, at pages 179 and 180, 52 S.Ct. 548, 551, 76 L.Ed. 1038.
In Duncan v. New England Power Co., 225 Mass. 155, 113 N.E. 781, a hydroelectric generating plant was held to be ""a watermill"" within the meaning of the Massachusetts Mill Acts. In Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688, a different question was presented, and some phrases in the opinion support the plaintiff's view; but we do not think the Ashwander decision was intended to overrule the Pfost Case on the point under discussion, or ought to be so considered. On a question of this character, involving the construction of agreements relating to real estate, we are probably bound by the opinion of the state court, supra. In any event, we agree with it. We think a water power is ""used"" where it is applied to a water wheel or some similar apparatus, and that the use which is made of the power of the water wheel is not significant on the question before us.
To summarize: The plaintiff sold a specified amount of water under a specified head to be used on a specified site. There was no attempt to define or restrict the purposes for which the power derived from the water might be used. It may be that when the grants were made both parties envisioned mill buildings erected on the millsites, containing machinery suitable for operation by the appurtenant mill power; but the grants were not limited to such a situation. The expression ""using a mill power on"" a certain site carried no such restriction, nor is any such restriction fairly inferable as necessary for the protection of the plaintiff's rights. As suggested in the Pfost Case, supra, many uses of power involve the transformation of energy from one form to another. Where this occurs power is used. The provision now relied upon by the plaintiff may well have been inserted in order to prevent the transfer of mill powers from one site to another by means of canals — which might affect the plaintiff's security for rentals.
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, with costs.

Due to growing concerns about the environmental impacts of fossil fuels and the capacity and resilience of energy grids around the world, engineers and policymakers are increasingly turning their attention to energy storage solutions. Indeed, energy storage can help address the intermittency of solar and wind power; it can also, in many cases, respond rapidly to large fluctuations in demand, making the grid more responsive and reducing the need to build backup power plants. The effectiveness of an energy storage facility is determined by how quickly it can react to changes in demand, the rate of energy lost in the storage process, its overall energy storage capacity, and how quickly it can be recharged.
Energy storage is not new. Batteries have been used since the early 1800s, and pumped-storage hydropower has been operating in the United States since the 1920s. But the demand for a more dynamic and cleaner grid has led to a significant increase in the construction of new energy storage projects, and to the development of new or better energy storage solutions.
Fossil fuels are the most used form of energy, partly due to their transportability and the practicality of their stored form, which allows generators considerable control over the rate of energy supplied. In contrast, the energy generated by solar and wind is intermittent and reliant on the weather and season. As renewables have become increasingly prominent on the electrical grid, there has been a growing interest in systems that store clean energy
Energy storage can also contribute to meeting electricity demand during peak times, such as on hot summer days when air conditioners are blasting or at nightfall when households turn on their lights and electronics. Electricity becomes more expensive during peak times as power plants have to ramp up production in order to accommodate the increased energy usage. Energy storage allows greater grid flexibility as distributors can buy electricity during off-peak times when energy is cheap and sell it to the grid when it is in greater demand.
As extreme weather exacerbated by climate change continues to devastate U.S. infrastructure, government officials have become increasingly mindful of the importance of grid resilience. Energy storage helps provide resilience since it can serve as a backup energy supply when power plant generation is interrupted. In the case of Puerto Rico, where there is minimal energy storage and grid flexibility, it took approximately a year for electricity to be restored to all residents.
The International Energy Association (IEA) estimates that, in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, the world needs 266 GW of storage by 2030, up from 176.5 GW in 2017. Under current trends, Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that the global energy storage market will hit that target, and grow quickly to a cumulative 942 GW by 2040 (representing $620 billion in investment over the next two decades).
  Energy Storage Today

In 2017, the United States generated 4 billion megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, but only had 431 MWh of electricity storage available. Pumped-storage hydropower (PSH) is by far the most popular form of energy storage in the United States, where it accounts for 95 percent of utility-scale energy storage. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pumped-storage hydropower has increased by 2 gigawatts (GW) in the past 10 years. In 2015, the United States had 22 GW of PSH storage incorporated into the grid. Yet, despite the widespread use of PSH, in the past decade the focus of technological advancement has been on battery storage.
By December 2017, there was approximately 708 MW of large-scale battery storage operational in the U.S. energy grid. Most of this storage is operated by organizations charged with balancing the power grid, such as Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). ISOs and RTOs are “independent, federally-regulated non-profit organizations” that control regional electricity pricing and distribution.
PJM, a regional transmission organization located in 13 eastern states (including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Illinois), has the largest amount of large-scale battery installations, with a storage capacity of 278 MW at the end of 2017. The second biggest owner of large-scale battery capacity is California’s ISO (CAISO). By the end of 2017, CAISO operated batteries with a total storage capacity of 130MW.
Most of the battery storage projects that ISOs/RTOs develop are for short-term energy storage and are not built to replace the traditional grid. Most of these facilities use lithium-ion batteries, which provide enough energy to shore up the local grid for approximately four hours or less. These facilities are used for grid reliability, to integrate renewables into the grid, and to provide relief to the energy grid during peak hours.
There is also a limited market for small-scale energy storage. While a minor portion of the small-scale storage capacity in the United States is for residential use, most of it is for use in the commercial sector—and most of these commercial projects are located in California.
In the past decade, the cost of energy storage, solar and wind energy have all dramatically decreased, making solutions that pair storage with renewable energy more competitive. In a bidding war for a project by Xcel Energy in Colorado, the median price for energy storage and wind was $21/MWh, and it was $36/MWh for solar and storage (versus $45/MWh for a similar solar and storage project in 2017). This compares to $18.10/MWh and $29.50/MWh, respectively, for wind and solar solutions without storage, but is still a long way from the $4.80/MWh median price for natural gas. Much of the price decrease is due to the falling costs of lithium-ion batteries; from 2010 to 2016 battery costs for electric vehicles (similar to the technology used for storage) fell 73 percent. A recent GTM Research report estimates that the price of energy storage systems will fall 8 percent annually through 2022.
  Selected Energy Storage Technologies

There are many different ways of storing energy, each with their strengths and weaknesses. The list below focuses on technologies that can currently provide large storage capacities (of at least 20 MW). It therefore excludes superconducting magnetic energy storage and supercapacitors (with power ratings of less than 1 MW).

Characteristics of selected energy storage systems (source: The World Energy Council)

Pumped-Storage Hydropower
Pumped-storage hydro (PSH) facilities are large-scale energy storage plants that use gravitational force to generate electricity. Water is pumped to a higher elevation for storage during low-cost energy periods and high renewable energy generation periods. When electricity is needed, water is released back to the lower pool, generating power through turbines. Recent innovations have allowed PSH facilities to have adjustable speeds, in order to be more responsive to the needs of the energy grid, and also to operate in closed-loop systems. A closed loop PSH operates without being connected to a continuously flowing water source, unlike traditional pumped-storage hydropower, making pumped-storage hydropower an option for more locations.
In comparison to other forms of energy storage, pumped-storage hydropower can be cheaper, especially for very large capacity storage (which other technologies struggle to match). According to the Electric Power Research Institute, the installed cost for pumped-storage hydropower varies between $1,700 and $5,100/kW, compared to $2,500/kW to 3,900/kW for lithium-ion batteries. Pumped-storage hydropower is more than 80 percent energy efficient through a full cycle, and PSH facilities can typically provide 10 hours of electricity, compared to about 6 hours for lithium-ion batteries. Despite these advantages, the challenge of PSH projects is that they are long-term investments: permitting and construction can take 3-5 years each. This can scare off investors who would prefer shorter-term investments, especially in a fast-changing market.
In Bath County, Virginia, the largest pumped-hydro storage facility in the world supplies power to about 750,000 homes. It was built in 1985 and has an output of approximately 3 GW.

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)
With compressed air storage, air is pumped into an underground hole, most likely a salt cavern, during off-peak hours when electricity is cheaper. When energy is needed, the air from the underground cave is released back up into the facility, where it is heated and the resulting expansion turns an electricity generator. This heating process usually uses natural gas, which releases carbon; however, CAES triples the energy output of facilities using natural gas alone. CAES can achieve up to 70 percent energy efficiency when the heat from the air pressure is retained, otherwise efficiency is between 42 and 55 percent. Currently, there are only two operating CAES facilities: one in McIntosh, Alabama and one in Huntorf, Germany. The McIntosh plant, which was built in 1991, has 110 MW of storage. A 317 MW CAES plant is under construction in Anderson County, Texas.

Thermal (including Molten Salt)
Thermal energy storage facilities use temperature to store energy. When energy needs to be stored, rocks, salts, water, or other materials are heated and kept in insulated environments. When energy needs to be generated, the thermal energy is released by pumping cold water onto the hot rocks, salts, or hot water in order to produce steam, which spins turbines. Thermal energy storage can also be used to heat and cool buildings instead of generating electricity. For example, thermal storage can be used to make ice overnight to cool a building during the day. Thermal efficiency can range from 50 percent to 90 percent depending on the type of thermal energy used.

Lithium-ion Batteries
First commercially produced by Sony in the early 1990s, lithium-ion batteries were originally used primarily for small-scale consumer items such as cellphones. Recently, they have been used for larger-scale battery storage and electric vehicles. At the end of 2017, the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack for electric vehicles fell to $209/kWh, assuming a cycle life of 10-15 years. Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that lithium-ion batteries will cost less than $100 kWh by 2025.
Lithium-ion batteries are by far the most popular battery storage option today and control more than 90 percent of the global grid battery storage market. Compared to other battery options, lithium-ion batteries have high energy density and are lightweight. New innovations, such as replacing graphite with silicon to increase the battery’s power capacity, are seeking to make lithium-ion batteries even more competitive for longer-term storage.
Additionally, lithium-ion batteries are now frequently used in developing countries for rural electrification. In rural communities, lithium-ion batteries are paired with solar panels to allow households and businesses to use limited amounts of electricity to charge cell phones, run appliances, and light buildings. Previously, such communities had to rely on dirty and expensive diesel generators, or did not have access to electricity.
When the Aliso Canyon natural gas facility leaked in 2015, California rushed to use lithium-ion technology to offset the loss of energy from the facility during peak hours. The battery storage facilities, built by Tesla, AES Energy Storage and Greensmith Energy, provide 70 MW of power, enough to power 20,000 houses for four hours.
Hornsdale Power Reserve in Southern Australia is the world’s largest lithium-ion battery and is used to stabilize the electrical grid with energy it receives from a nearby wind farm. This 100 MW battery was built by Tesla and provides electricity to more than 30,000 households.
General Electric has designed 1 MW lithium-ion battery containers that will be available for purchase in 2019. They will be easily transportable and will allow renewable energy facilities to have smaller, more flexible energy storage options.

Lead-acid Batteries
Lead-acid batteries were among the first battery technologies used in energy storage. However, they are not popular for grid storage because of their low-energy density and short cycle and calendar life. They were commonly used for electric cars, but have recently been largely replaced with longer-lasting lithium-ion batteries.

Flow Batteries
Flow batteries are an alternative to lithium-ion batteries. While less popular than lithium-ion batteries—flow batteries make up less than 5 percent of the battery market—flow batteries have been used in multiple energy storage projects that require longer energy storage durations. Flow batteries have relatively low energy densities and have long life cycles, which makes them well-suited for supplying continuous power. The Avista Utilities plant in Washington state, for instance, uses flow battery storage.
A 200 MW (800 MWh) flow battery is currently being constructed in Dalian, China. This system will not only overtake the Hornsdale Power Reserve as the world’s biggest battery, but it will also be the only large-scale battery (>100 MW) that is made up of flow batteries instead of lithium ion batteries.

Solid State Batteries
Solid state batteries have multiple advantages over lithium-ion batteries in large-scale grid storage. Solid-state batteries contain solid electrolytes which have higher energy densities and are much less prone to fires than liquid electrolytes, such as those found in lithium-ion batteries. Their smaller volumes and higher safety make solid-state batteries well suited for large-scale grid applications.
However, solid state battery technology is currently more expensive than lithium-ion battery technology because it is less developed. Fast-growing lithium-ion production has led to economies of scale, which solid-state batteries will find hard to match in the coming years.

Hydrogen
Hydrogen fuel cells, which generate electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, have appealing characteristics: they are reliable and quiet (with no moving parts), have a small footprint and high energy density, and release no emissions (when running on pure hydrogen, their only byproduct is water). The process can also be reversed, making it useful for energy storage: electrolysis of water produces oxygen and hydrogen. Fuel cell facilities can, therefore, produce hydrogen when electricity is cheap, and later use that hydrogen to generate electricity when it is needed (in most cases, the hydrogen is produced in one location, and used in another). Hydrogen can also be produced by reforming biogas, ethanol, or hydrocarbons, a cheaper method that emits carbon pollution. Though hydrogen fuel cells remain expensive (primarily because of their need for platinum, an expensive metal), they are being used as primary and backup power for many critical facilities (telecom relays, data centers, credit card processing…).

Flywheels
Flywheels are not suitable for long-term energy storage, but are very effective for load-leveling and load-shifting applications. Flywheels are known for their long-life cycle, high-energy density, low maintenance costs, and quick response speeds. Motors store energy into flywheels by accelerating their spins to very high rates (up to 50,000 rpm). The motor can later use that stored kinetic energy to generate electricity by going into reverse. Flywheels are commonly left in a vacuum so as to minimize air friction, which would slow the wheel. The Stephentown Spindle in Stephentown, New York, unveiled in 2011 with a capacity of 20 MW, was the first commercial use of flywheel technology to regulate the grid in the United States. Several other flywheel facilities have since come on line.
  Storage and Electric Vehicles

Energy storage is especially important for electric vehicles (EVs). As electric vehicles become more widespread, they will increase electricity demand at peak times, as professionals come home from work and plug in their cars for a nightly recharge. To prevent the need for new power plants to meet this extra demand, electricity will need to be stored during off-peak times. Storage is also important for households that generate their own renewable electricity: a car cannot be charged overnight by solar energy without a storage system.
Interestingly, electric vehicles can be used as back-up storage during periods of grid failure or spikes in demand. Although most EVs today are not designed to supply energy back into the grid, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) cars can store electricity in car batteries and then transfer that energy back into the grid later. EV batteries can still be used in grid storage even after they are taken off the road: utilities are using the batteries from retired EVs as second-hand energy storage. Such batteries can be used to store electricity for up to a decade for grid applications. An example of this can be found in Elverlingsen, Germany, where almost 2,000 batteries from Mercedes Benz EVs were collected to create a stationary grid-sized battery that can hold almost 9 MW of power.
  Federal and State Energy Storage Policies

In February 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) unanimously approved Order No. 841, which required Independent System Operators and Regional Transmission Organizations to remove barriers to entry for energy storage technologies, by having these groups reevaluate their tariffs. The FERC believes this will lead to greater market competition in the energy grid sector.
In May 2018, the Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E) committed up to $30 million in funding for long-term energy storage innovation. The funding went to the Duration Addition to electricitY Storage (DAYS) program, which focuses on developing new technologies that can make it possible for energy storage facilities in all U.S. regions to power an electrical grid for up to 100 hours.
Several U.S. states have taken a keen interest in energy storage, and their policies can serve as inspiration for others.
Hawaii, where importing fossil fuels is very costly, has been at the forefront of the transition to renewables and energy storage. Two recent Hawaiian Electric Industries projects come in at 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, half as much as the price for fossil fuel generation in the state.
Massachusetts passed H.4857 in July of 2018, setting a goal of 1,000 MWh of energy storage by the end of 2025.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced in January 2018 that New York had set a goal of reaching 1,500 MW's worth of energy storage by 2025. Under this directive, New York Green Bank has agreed to invest $200 million towards energy storage technologies.
California's three largest electric cooperatives have been mandated to develop a combined storage capacity of 1,325 MW by the end of 2024. An extra 500 MW was added to the mandate in 2016.
In Oregon, law HB 2193 mandates that 5 MWh of energy storage must be working in the grid by 2020.
New Jersey passed A3723 in 2018 that sets New Jersey’s energy storage target at 2,000 MW by 2030.
Arizona State Commissioner Andy Tobin has proposed a target of 3,000 MW in energy storage by 2030.

Timeless, renewable, powerful
Hydroelectric power, or water power, is a timeless, renewable resource that has fuelled Ontario's economic growth since the beginning of the 20th century. Today, it accounts for more than one-third of Ontario Power Generation's (OPG's) electricity production.
See why clean hydroelectric power is an important part of OPG’s energy mix for Ontario.

Diving into hydroelectricity
Hydroelectric power is such a popular renewable energy source because it is a clean, reliable, and low-cost way to produce the energy Ontario needs.
Hydro generation relies on water, a renewable resource that OPG shares with Indigenous communities as well as local governments, industry and environmental groups, and recreational users.
Hydroelectric power is the lowest-cost energy source. OPG continues to look for development opportunities like the Peter Sutherland Sr. Generating Station built with partners Taykwa Tagamou Nation or to upgrade or expand existing stations like the Calabogie project.
Exploring Ontario's hydro opportunities
A new report identifies areas of high generation potential, and provides initial estimates on developing this potential.

Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project
Puget Sound Energy's Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project, located about 30 miles east of Seattle on the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains, is one of the oldest hydropower plants in the United States.
The Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project is located on the Snoqualmie River in Snoqualmie, Washington. The Project consists of a low diversion dam located 150 feet upstream from Snoqualmie Falls and two powerhouses (Plants 1 and 2) with a total generating capacity of 54 megawatts. Snoqualmie Falls Plant 1, located in a cavern 270 feet below Snoqualmie Falls, was originally built in 1898 as the world's first completely underground powerhouse. Snoqualmie Falls Plant 2, about a quarter-mile downstream from Plant 1, was built in 1910 and expanded in 1957.
After operating for more than a century, the facility still produces clean, renewable electricity for PSE customers. The project contains a small diversion structure just upstream from Snoqualmie Falls, and two powerhouses. The first powerhouse is encased in bedrock 260 feet beneath the surface and was the world's first completely underground power plant. Together, the two power plants currently have 53 megawatts of generating capacity.
Puget Sound Energy redeveloped the Snoqualmie Falls Project between 2010 and 2015, making extensive improvements to Plants 1 and Plant 2 as well as Snoqualmie Falls Park and historic buildings near the falls.
The project received a new, 40-year federal operating license in 2004. The facility recently underwent a four-year redevelopment project, which included substantial upgrades and enhancements to the power-generating infrastructure and public recreational facilities. Check out the recreational opportunities we offer at the facility.

Bakun Hydroelectric Power Plant, Malaysia
This 2,400 MW storage plant is underpinned by the highest dam in southeast Asia
The Bakun hydroelectric project is located in central Sarawak on the Balui tributary of the Rejang River, approximately 180 km by road east of Bintulu on the coast. SMEC was appointed in 2018 to develop a 300 MW extension to the facility by constructing a 1.2 km-long, 8.5 m-diameter headrace tunnel through the dam’s right abutment to a new underground power station.
The new plant would have a single 300 MW unit that would utilize the redundant diversion tunnels of the existing scheme as the new tailrace.
 SMEC’s Hydropower & Dams project team will provide a detailed analysis for increasing the existing hydropower scheme capacity, without interrupting the operation of the existing powerplant and without drawing down the reservoir level.
 SMEC was involved in the original 2,400 MW project, providing consultancy services for the management and engineering audit.
 Bakun Hydro features a 205 m high concrete faced rockfill dam (the third highest dam of its type in the world) with a twin chute spillway of 15,000 m3/s total capacity. The power station comprises eight 300 MW nominal capacity generating units in a surface power station structure located at the base of the dam.
 Each unit is supplied from a single power conduit ranging in size from 7 m diameter for the steel lined high pressure sections, to 8.5 m diameter for the concrete lined sections and shafts. The units are not equipped with inlet valves, and for unit isolation rely on hydraulically operated intake gates located on the power intake structure, adjacent to the spillway gates and draft tube outlet gates on the downstream wall of the power station.

Abstract
In the Amazon region of Brazil the exploitation of natural resources presents deforestation of native forests as a major environmental problems caused by the cutting of trees intended for illegal timber trade and formation of pastures for livestock production. Currently, there is a scientific and popular discussion about the environmental impacts caused by the installation of hydroelectric projects. This article aims to expose some of the major environmental problems arising from the implementation of the hydroelectric plant of Belo Monte, in which it makes an integrated and geosystemic environmental and socioeconomic analysis of the area under direct and indirect influence of the project, located in the lower region Xingu river course in the state of Pará. The geosystemic methodology allows an integrated view of relations between physical and anthropic components, contributing as support for regional, municipal and local environmental planning.

Bonneville Lock & Dam
Bonneville Lock & Dam, built and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was the first federal lock and dam on the Columbia and Snake rivers. The project’s first powerhouse, spillway and original navigation lock were completed in 1938 to improve navigation on Columbia River and provide hydropower to the Pacific Northwest. A second powerhouse was completed in 1982, and a larger navigation lock in 1993. 
Today, the project is a critical part of the water resource management system that power generation, navigation, water quality improvement, fish and wildlife habitat including fish passage and recreation along the Columbia River.
A Public Works Administration project of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, portions of Bonneville Lock and Dam Project were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987.
  National Historic Landmark
Bonneville’s significance is based on the Colonial-Revival style architecture of the administration building and auditorium, the unique engineering design, the contribution to the region’s industrial development, the lock’s role in transportation, the entrance landscaping, and the role of Bonneville as a major government undertaking in the 1930s to provide jobs during the Great Depression.

Bonneville Lock and Dam is named for Army Captain Benjamin Bonneville, an early day visionary who led an exploration to the Oregon Country and charted extensive sections of what became the Oregon Trail.
Hydropower
Bonneville Lock & Dam is one of three hydroelectric power plants operated by the Portland District along the Columbia River. The dam generates enough electricity to power approximately 900,000 homes, or a city the size of Portland, Ore.
   1st powerhouse length 1027 ft 313 m
 Generators/total output ten 660 mw
 2nd powerhouse length 986 ft 300.5 m
 Generators/total output eight 558 mw
Navigation
Our first mission, eliminating impediments to navigation on the Pacific Northwest's rivers, dates back to 1871.
A navigation lock was built during the original construction of Bonneville Dam. A larger lock was constructed in 1993, in a comparable size to the seven other locks on the 465 mile Columbia-Snake River Inland Waterway.

Spillway length 1,450 ft 442 m
  -gates 18
  -reservoir above downstream side 60 ft 18.3 m
Navigation lock length 676 ft 206 m
 -width 85 ft 25.9 m

Help preserve this unique area and also protect yourself, children, and pets from poison oak by staying on the established trail and keeping your pet on a leash. Spectacular views of the Columbia River and Bonneville Dam can be seen from here. Directions: Once on Bonneville property, turn right at the first stop sign, then an immediate left into the Fort Cascades Historical Site parking lot. Hours are seasonal: March - October, 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. / November - February, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.
North Shore Recreation Area (WA): This site provides spectacular views of the river, surrounding gorge and wildlife viewing. The open shoreline between the Fort Cascades Historic Site and the Washington Shore Visitor Complex is available for fishing with access to vault restrooms. Intermittent sections of gravel trail stretch along the shoreline for approximately one mile. Hours are seasonal: March - October, 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. / November - February, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Tanner Creek Fishing Area (OR): In addition to fishing, this site provides great wildlife viewing of salmon spawning in the fall and several species of birds throughout the year. Two trails lead down from the parking lot for access to the fishing area. There are flush toilets available near the parking area. Hours are seasonal: March-September, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. / October, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. / November-February, 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.
  GEOCACHES AT BONNEVILLE LOCK & DAM
Park rangers at Bonneville Lock and Dam maintain five geocaches. Beginner and advanced geocachers will enjoy the hunt.
""Green Power"" is centered around the benefits of hydropower
""More Power to You"" is a multicache about the Northwestern hydropower system
""Go with the Flow"" is a multicache about the Juvenile Fish Bypass System
""BIH"" highlights the fascinating history of Bradford Island
Rangers and volunteers are available to help!
There are also some privately-managed caches that have been allowed on site that we do not directly manage, but those should follow our Portland District Guidelines. Please contact the Bonneville Ranger staff before placing a cache on lands managed by Bonneville Lock and Dam to ensure that appropriate guidelines are met.  We would like to avoid having caches placed in areas that are sensitive or pose a safety or security risk. Unauthorized caches or those not meeting the guidelines may be removed. Our goal is to provide a safe and enjoyable visitor experience for all that use the site, while helping to protect our entrusted resources. For more information about hiding or finding geocaches, you can visit www.geocaching.com.
  PARTNER-OPERATED, CO-LOCATED SITES
Bonneville Fish Hatchery (OR): This chinook and coho salmon hatchery is operated by Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife. Display ponds also offer a relaxing place to feed large rainbow trout and view adult white sturgeon measuring more than six feet long. A gift shop is open during summer months. Interpretive displays are inside buildings and outdoors, including a viewing area to watch fall spawning activities. Hours are seasonal: March-October, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. / October, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. / November-February, 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Directions: At the flag pole intersection on Bonneville Dam property, bear left. Follow the road around to the large parking lot on the left.  RV parking is available here. 
Columbia River Gorge Historic Highway (OR): Operated jointly by the U.S. Forest Service and the State of Oregon, the nation’s first scenic highway was constructed between 1913 and 1922. This trail has reserved areas for pedestrian and bicycle use only, such as the section between Tanner Creek, Eagle Creek and Cascade Locks.  Please note that if you are biking the trial, there is no bike/pedestrian access to the Bradford Island Visitor Center at Bonneville Dam (on the Oregon side of the river) due to restrictions across the powerhouse.

Detailed Description
Diagram of a hydroelectric generator is courtesy of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
As to how this generator works, the Corps of Engineers explains it this way:
""A hydraulic turbine converts the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy. A hydroelectric generator converts this mechanical energy into electricity. The operation of a generator is based on the principles discovered by Faraday. He found that when a magnet is moved past a conductor, it causes electricity to flow. In a large generator, electromagnets are made by circulating direct current through loops of wire wound around stacks of magnetic steel laminations. These are called field poles, and are mounted on the perimeter of the rotor. The rotor is attached to the turbine shaft, and rotates at a fixed speed. When the rotor turns, it causes the field poles (the electromagnets) to move past the conductors mounted in the stator. This, in turn, causes electricity to flow and a voltage to develop at the generator output terminals.""

Abstract
Global climate change, related to the greenhouse gases emission, impacts hydroelectric power generation mainly due to the increase in air temperature and changes in the precipitation patterns. As a consequence, it affects basin evapotranspiration process, runoff, sediment transport as well as evaporation of reservoirs. This study analysed the current and future Brazilian context of hydroelectric reservoirs and investigated the potential impacts of climate change on hydropower generation and possible mitigation adjustments, giving relevant examples from around the world. Moreover, it is key to consider other factors that influence the availability of water resources such as: (a) upstream development of reservoirs, mainly the development of agricultural systems, which can contribute to increased water demand; (b) changes in land use, which can have an impact on soil degradation and sediment transport. Hydroelectric dams are a possible alternative to mitigate the impacts of climate change considering that those impacts could generate the need of adaptive actions. The assessment of climate change impacts’ projections anticipates possible future scenarios and can assist in strategic planning together with the definition of adaptive operational policies.
Keywords: hydropower plants; climate changes; reservoirs; Brazil
1. Introduction
Hydroelectric plants are the main sources of electricity in some countries (e.g., Paraguay, Norway, Brazil, Austria and Canada). Hydropower contributes about 85% of global renewable electricity [1,2]. It is the main source of renewable energy in South America, followed by biofuels [3]. In several regions of the world (e.g., Southeast Asia and South America), the hydroelectric plants are one of the pillars for the production of renewable energy, but, at the same time, they are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change [4]. These changes are causing the majority of the variations in hydroelectric potential [5]. Other factors, such as changes in land use and demand for upstream irrigation, can also influence water availability for energy generation [5,6,7].
Brazil has one of the largest hydroelectric potentials and it is believed that hydroelectricity will continue to play an important role in the next ten years [8]. In the country, 80% of the energy generated comes from renewable sources [9]. The Brazilian energy matrix is composed mainly of hydroelectric plants (60.9%), followed by fossil fuels (16.11%), biomass (8.74%), eolic (7.52%), import (4.91%), nuclear (1.20%) and solar (0.61%) [10]. The 85 solar power plants account for 1,021,602 kW of the installed capacity, and only 0.61% of the energy matrix [10]. Even though the country has areas with high solar irradiation, there are no available technologies for its deployment, showing a clear need for investments in national technologies [11]. Most of the equipment required for the installation of solar photovoltaic and concentrated solar thermal plants is imported, which implies high costs [12].
Regarding energy sources, hydroelectric plants are likely to be more affected by changes in annual and seasonal precipitation as well as temperature increase [13,14], with smaller impact on other energy system sources [15]. Two opposite sides must be considered in terms of energy generation and climate change: on one hand, there is energy generation producing emissions (including hydroelectric; through the decomposition of organic matter in reservoirs), which requires mitigation strategies; and, on the other hand, the impact of climate change on renewable energy sources, requiring adaptation strategies [13].
Water resource use for generation of energy is dependent on hydrological and climatic conditions [4,5,6,8,15,16,17,18,19]. Global warming may influence the intensity and duration of rainfall, the discharge volume of rivers, the increased evaporation rate of reservoirs and the amount of evapotranspiration of plants [20]. Thus, these factors interfere in the water availability for energy generation and may trigger indirect effects such as changes in land use and an increased demand for irrigation [18].
Several impacts of climate change on hydroelectric reservoirs can be considered: hydrological changes, variation in sediment load due to flooding, variation in volume and river flow due to changes in precipitation, and the occurrence of extreme events (e.g., droughts and floods) that can generate the need for dam design and safety improvements [1,2,3,4,5,6,8].
Hydropower reservoirs are less susceptive to climate change than run-of-river schemes due to its storage capacity as well as being less seasonal flow dependent [18]. This resilience depends on dry season duration [13]. The changes in the flow affect the level of reservoir and, consequently, the capacity of energy generation [18,19]. In Brazil, there are expectations that future hydroelectric installations will be of run-of-river due to environmental restrictions for the construction of large reservoirs, resulting in the use of the total installed capacity of water flow schemes only during the rainy season. In the dry season, other plants, such as thermoelectric plants, would need to be used to meet the energy demand [21].
Climate change must be taken into account in the process of water resources planning and management, so that measures are taken to adapt to future climate scenarios [6]. Adaptation strategies for the operation of reservoirs should be implemented [5,16,22], since hydroelectric plants are fundamental for electricity in Brazil [19].
Through a review of the literature, this study aims:
To provide an overview of the current state of hydroelectric plants in Brazil, focusing on reservoir plant types, providing insights into recent policies for the development of hydropower (Section 2);
To assess the potential for new hydroelectric plants in the country (Section 3);
To put the current state of hydroelectric plants in Brazil into context in comparison with other countries (Section 4);
To present the possible impacts of climate change on hydroelectric power generation. To analyse and compare methodologies and results of studies that evaluate the impact of climate change on energy generation by hydroelectric reservoirs (Section 5);
To identify measures to adapt to future climate scenarios that have been the focus of studies in Brazil and in other countries. (Section 6);
To present a framework directed to the study of climatic and environmental impact on the generation of hydroelectricity (Section 7).
2. Current Situation of Brazilian Hydroelectric Plants
Brazil has a great hydroelectric potential, totalling 101,268,561 kW, which corresponds to 60.9% of the energy matrix. There are 1313 operating plants ranging from hydroelectric generation centrals (with up to 1 MW of power installed), small hydropower plants (between 1.1 MW and 30 MW) and hydroelectric power plants (with more than 30 MW). The 218 hydroelectric power plants (HPP) are responsible for 60.5% of the total installed capacity in the country, adding up to 95,619,468 kW. The small hydroelectric plants (SHP), 428 in total, answer for 3.2% of the total installed power. The 667 hydroelectric generation centrals (HGC) in operation account for only 0.4% of the installed power [23].
The largest Brazilian hydroelectric power plant is Itaipu, located in the Paraná River [8]. After its construction, the Belo Monte hydroelectric in the Amazon basin will be the third largest hydroelectric power plant in the world (11,233 MW). The second largest is Itaipu, producing 14,000 MW, and the largest in the world is the Three Gorges hydroelectric plant in China, producing 22,500 MW [2,8]. The main Brazilian plants with regularization reservoirs are presented in Table 1 and sorted by region and importance in useful volume.
Table 1. Main Brazilian hydropower plants with reservoirs—based on data from [24].
The Serra da Mesa hydroelectric power plant on the Tocantins River has the highest useful volume, at 43.25 km3; followed by the Tucurui plant, in the same river, at 38.98 km3, which stands out in terms of installed power at 8370 MW [24]. Usually the levels of the reservoirs are higher in the summer, from December to March (more abundant rainy period), and lower between April and November, when there is the dry season [8].
Recent studies addressed the current situation of SHP in Brazil, exposing regulations and policies for the growth of the number of plants and the perspectives for the sector [25]. Brazilian SHPs are expanding due to their characteristics of small area occupancy and minor environmental impact, besides the possibility of installation closer to the places of consumption, which reduces the loss of energy in the transmission and, consequently, results in a reduction of costs for the consumer.
The main Brazilian hydroelectric reservoirs are in the Paraná river basin. The concentration of hydroelectric power plants is higher in the Midwest, South and Southeast regions (Figure 1). The Southwest region accounts for 70% of the energy storage capacity. The largest hydroelectric reservoirs are installed near the regions of greatest demand. When full, these reservoirs can store energy to meet the demands for five months, a much shorter period than that observed in the 1970s, when the energy stored in the reservoirs, at maximum capacity, could meet the demand for three or four years [26]. These changes arise as a result to the increase in energy demand caused by population growth, in addition to climate and environmental changes.

Recent Policies for the Development of Hydropower
In Brazil, renewable energy sources are considered fundamental for sustainable development [28]. Two strategies with regard to the energy sector have been incorporated in Brazil, one focusing on a clean and renewable energy matrix, mainly hydroelectric, and the other promoting efficient use and conservation [11]. However, the country needs to review current energy policies in the context of economic growth and also to consider climate change, with investments in energy efficiency, renewable sources and the necessary technological improvements [29].
Brazil has opted to increase energy security levels, increase energy generation capacity, and, with this expansion, environmental and social problems have arisen. In order to avoid greater environmental impacts, the main strategy goes towards new projects for run-of-river. However, this policy ends up affecting the generation of energy during dry periods, due to lesser river flow [30]. To achieve energy security, the country has invested in hydroelectric and thermal plants, in order to compensate for the lower generation of hydropower during dry periods [29].
In run-of-river schemes, energy costs are higher due to the possibility of inactivity in dry periods caused by the absence of a reservoir. The construction time is shorter, on average two years. With regard to environmental impacts, the cumulative effects of several run-of-river installed in the same basin must be considered [8]. In addition, the implementation of run-of-river hydropower plants can also contribute to the increase of emissions indirectly, with the need to complement the hydroelectric potential with thermoelectric plants [29].
In contrast, large reservoirs maximise electricity production, ensuring greater energy security of the system during periods of drought [5,31]. However, some factors may affect the decision on the construction of hydroelectric reservoirs such as: building time; greenhouse gas emissions; fragmentation of the rivers; changes in water quality; relocating or displacing humans; interference in migration and spawning fish.
The average building time of large dams is 8.6 years [32]. Since the 1990s, possible emissions from reservoirs have attracted the attention of several researchers [33,34,35,36]. Even though it is a renewable source of energy, there are potential greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs, such as: methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Large amounts of organic matter remain in the reservoir when the area is flooded, leading to the production of these gases. One of the major concerns is the emission of methane [37]. According to Zarfl et al. [38], the quantitative emissions depend on how water is released in dams. The release of deep water contributes most significantly for emissions.
Studies carried out in areas in riparian and grassland environments of the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex (Pará) indicate that the most significant concentrations were CO2 with a daily mean value of 10,448.41 ± 3036.48 mg m−2 for pasture and 8004.50 ± 1314.98 mg m−2 for forest [2]. The Belo Monte mill may produce 1 million tons of CO2 per year during the first ten years [12,39]. Dams such as Jirau and Santo Antônio will have lower emissions, due to the size of the reservoirs [40].
The amount of emissions varies according to the age of the reservoir, the type of land use before impoundment, management practices, climatic conditions [1,2] and/or the location and morphometry of the reservoir [38]. Moreover, it should also be noticed that greenhouse gas emissions in reservoirs are higher in the first 10 years [39,40].
The construction of reservoirs also contribute to the fragmentation of the rivers, relocating or displacing humans (especially of indigenous) [38], changes in water quality [41], interference in migration and spawning fish, flooding and drainage of areas for fish production [42]. Pringle et al. [43] relate some fish-related effects: population fragmentation and isolation, migration interference, increases in exotic lentic-adapted species (non-native fishes) and the threat of extinction of some species. Therefore, dams are fundamental for the maintenance of society; however, one must think about environmental sustainability and socio-economic impacts, i.e., the best way to build, operate and maintain dams [44].
3. The Potential for New Hydropower Plants in Brazil
Considering the focus of the hydroelectric expansion in the Amazon, due to the nearly exhausted hydroelectric potential in other Brazilian regions [30], important environmental concerns are raised regarding the hydroelectric potential in the Amazon region and studies reporting the impacts caused by dams in this region, such as the emission of greenhouse gases due to flooding of forest areas, the loss of conservation areas, changes in water quality, interference with the displacement and reproduction of aquatic animals, a decline in biodiversity as well as social and cultural impacts [29,31].
The socio-environmental constraints and vulnerabilities of the use of hydroelectric potential, for each Brazilian region, include flood risks in large areas (Northern region), few perennial rivers (Northeast and South), border rivers, floods and agro-industrial pollution (Southeast) and border rivers with high levels of sedimentation (Midwestern region) [30]. Most of the hydropower plants under construction are located in the state of Mato Grosso and Parana (Table 2). The hydropower reservoir (Sinop) and run-of-river (São Manoel) located in the Amazon basin are scheduled to start operating in 2018 [45].
Table 2. Hydroelectric plants: Under construction and planned—data from [23].
4. Comparison to Other Countries
Most of the large dams around the world were built between the years of 1950–1989 and are related to population growth and consequently increased energy consumption. Regarding their main use, 39% were built for power generation, 29% for irrigation, 14% for flood control, 8% for water supply and 10% for other uses [44]. The reduction in growth rate of number dams built since the 1990s is due to social and environmental concerns, high financial costs and reduction of favorable locations [44]. In Brazil, there was an increase in the deployment of large hydroelectric plants in the 1960s and 1970s due to changes in tax criteria, followed by a reduction in construction of new developments in the 1980s and 1990s due to higher inflation and two oil shocks [46].
The five largest producers of hydroelectricity in the world are: China, Canada, Brazil, the United States and Russia [47]. According to estimates, hydroelectric production may double by 2050, contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel plants [1]. When predicting population growth, water, food, energy consumption and dam development from 2010–2050, Chen et al. [44] foresee about 36,813 dams worldwide, with a total reservoir capacity of 9204 km3 in 2050, and, in 2010, there were 32,473 dams with a capacity of 7975 km3. In terms of energy consumption, the estimate is an increase from 134,000 to 183,000 TW h.
Future dams will be concentrated in developing countries and emerging economies (Southeast Asia, South America and Africa). Approximately 75% of the dams will be of medium and small size (1–100 MW) and 93% of the future hydroelectric power capacity will be provided by large dams (more than 100 MW). In Brazil, the dams under construction are concentrated in the North and South regions and those planned are in the South and Southeast regions of the country [38].
5. Possible Impacts of Climate Change on the Generation of Hydroelectricity
The increase in greenhouse gas emissions and consequently climate change demonstrates having an impact on energy production in Brazil, as well as in other countries that rely heavily on hydropower [29]. Climate change affects the performance and safety of dams in various ways [14], such as: increased sediment load of rivers, impacting turbine operation and loss of storage; increasing reservoir surface evaporation, reducing the amount of water available; generating changes in rainfall and river flows, interfering with the turbines full capacity operation; and increasing the magnitude of floods that can lead to failures in dams. The main factors that interfere in the generation of hydroelectric power globally [13] are:
Reduction in average precipitation that implies a reduction in runoff (three to four times).
Increase in average precipitation. Depending on storage and turbine capacity, increased precipitation can lead to an increase in power generation potential. However, this does not always occur, considering that plants are designed for a certain river flow, and the increase of this flow would only lead to unproductive spills.
Increase in average temperature. Rising temperatures will affect soil moisture levels, interfering with the runoff and storage of water in dams. In addition, increase of temperature causes changes in atmospheric pressure and wind patterns. These changes can alter the precipitation patterns [30].
Extreme droughts. Depending on the duration of the drought period, the reservoirs act as a buffer, maintaining normal power generation capacity.
Flooding. It entails sediment loads beyond what is expected, and depending on installed capacity, they do not always bring benefits in terms of increasing the potential for generating power.
There are also the indirect impacts of climate change: water scarcity and competition among other sectors (e.g., agriculture, industries, urban consumption); soil degradation and siltation, depending on the vulnerability of the soil to the action of rainwater and river, scarcity of vegetation and soil desiccation during periods of drought, promoting erosion and transport of sediments to reservoirs [13].
The most cited studies in the literature on the impact of climate change on hydroelectric power production are that of Christensen et al. [48] and Lehner et al. [49]. Lehner et al. [49] analysed the effects of global changes on Europe’s hydroelectric potential by applying the WaterGAP model (Water-Global Assessment and Prognosis) [50] for runoff calculations and compared current climate and water use conditions with future scenarios. The study pointed out severe future changes in the discharge regimes that will lead to instability in the European hydroelectric potential that could be reduced by 6% by the 2070s. Christensen et al. [48] simulated future climatic conditions and their effects on the Colorado River basin. The results of this study indicated warming, reduced precipitation, decreased runoff and a significant reduction in annual hydroelectric power generation: 56% (2010–2039); 45% (2040–2069); and 53% (2070–2098) in relation to the simulated history.
For South America, the projections indicate an increase in temperature and an increase (or decrease) in precipitation up to 2100; for some regions, there are large uncertainties related to precipitation. Warming varies from 1.7 to 6.7 °C by 2100 and precipitation varies according to the region (−22% in Northeastern Brazil, +25% in South-Eastern South America). In Brazil, the Amazon is highlighted as a hotspot of global warming, a region most vulnerable to climate change [3].
In Brazil, few studies have evaluated the impacts of climate change on hydropower reservoirs [21,51]. Some studies have more generally evaluated the impact on river basins, not directly evaluating hydroelectric reservoirs [52,53]. Other studies analysed the vulnerability of hydroelectric generation to changes in climate [30,54].
Soito and Freitas [30] reported the risks to energy security in Brazil; the generation of electricity depends significantly on the hydrological availability that can be threatened by increasing water demands (driven by demographic growth and economic development), droughts in the Northeast, and degradation of rivers in the Southeast region (pollution, silting, etc.). In a more recent study, Sorribas et al. [53] examined projections of climate change (2070–2099) and their impacts on discharges from the Amazon basin and identified that, for some regions of the basin, there will be an increase in river discharge (Northwest, annual mean +9%) and, for other regions (central Amazon, annual minimum −15.9%), there will be a possible reduction of flow in dry seasons, which may impact the generation of energy from future hydroelectric plants.
Lucena et al. [21] evaluated the impacts of climate change on Brazilian river basins. The results point out a tendency for reduction in average annual flow in the period 2071–2100, mainly in the Parnaíba (−10.3%), São Francisco (−26.4%) and Tocantins-Araguaia (−15.8%) basins (North and Northeast regions of Brazil). In the South and Southeast regions, impacts will not be significant, so, in these regions, reservoir management would mitigate the effects of climate change. According to the results of an investigation by Ribeiro Júnior et al. [51], if climate change scenarios are confirmed, Furnas reservoir levels may decline sharply. The authors proposed a methodology that considers the determination of the length and transgression frequency of level to minimise the conflicts of water use and the impacts on the generation of energy.
Analysis conducted by Nóbrega et al. [55] in the Grand river basin showed an increase in average river flow at the Agua Vermelha reservoir (+10% in the A2 Scenario, from 2508 m3s−1 to 2748 m3s−1). Still, according to the study, the increase of 3 °C in global mean temperature can result in an increase in average river flow by 24% (from 2475 m3s−1 to 3070 m3s−1) generating flood risks. However, some projections indicate a reduction in average river flow by up to 20%.
In assessment of climate change impacts on river basins, there are uncertainties about greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios and global circulation models (GCMs), as well as uncertainties regarding downscaling and hydrological modelling [6]. GCMs produce climate projections, providing information on climate uncertainties and water availability more roughly, and are used directly in forecasting runoff in more general studies [14]. The simulations of climate change impacts are generally carried out with a control period and future scenarios of 30 years, comprising three phases of simulation, namely: model development, control simulation (base period), and simulation of future scenarios [4], in addition to using different variables (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Scheme for simulating the impact of climate change from Schaefli [4].
Assessing the impact of climatic changes in impoundment schemes is rather complex [4,18], requiring information such as inter-basin transfers and design specifications. The existing literature generally evaluates single locations, not establishing how to include multiple sites at national or regional levels, due to the need for detailed information on the operational behavior of each site. As reservoirs can serve different uses (e.g., irrigation), the indirect impacts of climate change on hydroelectric dams should also be evaluated [19].
The meteorological variables temperature and precipitation are important in climate change studies for hydroelectric management [13,16,20,56,57]. Some authors only model precipitation, considering it the higher impact factor on the availability of water for power generation [21]. Other authors propose a combined study between climatic changes and changes in land use [6,7] or between climate changes and demands for irrigation [5]. The inclusion of sediment load assessment in hydroelectric basins tends to be a significant contribution to the study of hydrological models. Another approach complements the gap: the need for an analysis of water demand, mainly for irrigation.
Some studies adopt only one scenario, not considering the different views of the general circulation models on the evolution of the climate and its repercussion in terms of the river basins, different from the one done by Haguma et al. [6], López-Moreno et al. [7], Gaudard et al. [17] and Parkinson et al. [57]. The use of several scenarios assists in the estimation of different uncertainties involved in hydro-climatic modelling [57], such as parameter uncertainty and model structural uncertainty. Climate models that consider a multi-model set, such as ENSEMBLES or CMIP5, provide more reliable assessment since they include different uncertainties [4].
Table 3 presents some insights on the possible climatic changes and their consequences in the runoff, flow of the rivers and generation of energy in hydroelectric reservoirs. The table includes the methodology used in each study to evaluate how different uncertainties (observational uncertainty, parameter uncertainty and model structural uncertainty) were included. A comparison between Brazil and other countries was also carried out.
Table 3. Methodologies and main results of studies on impacts of climate change on reservoir management.
In order to assess the impacts of climate change on water resources, it is necessary to predict the runoff of the basin. A model commonly used is the IHACRES, introduced by Jakeman and Hornberger [58], which interfaces climate change input data (temperature and precipitation). The IHACRES is a rainfall–runoff model used to calculate the flow of a river, considering climatic changes.
In some regions, such as in Canada, Manic-5 and Toulnustouc reservoirs, studies indicated positive effects in relation to climate change and power generation. These results are associated with the specific characteristics of the basins; however, as highlighted by the authors, in the long-term, global warming will provide potential negative effects on energy generation [6].
6. Adaptations to Reduce Vulnerability and Increase Resilience
Soito and Freitas [30] suggested that, in addition to the management of Brazilian reservoirs in terms of optimisation and adaptation to climate change, other measures should be taken into account for planning, execution and control phases of the plants, namely: establishment of an orderly use of the soil in the drainage basin; conservation of vegetation growth; regulation of the rivers flow and their tributaries; and the controlled disposal of industrial waste. It should also be considered the monitoring of sediment transport [70]. An overview of different adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of hydroelectric reservoirs to climate change is given in Table 4.
Table 4. Adaptations to reduce vulnerability of hydroelectric reservoirs to climate change.
The adaptability of hydroelectric schemes to climate change is dependent on local characteristics, specifically: project specifications; storage volume; morphological regime and environmental legislation [4,18]. For example:
Reservoirs with smaller surface area and greater depth tend to be less affected by global warming, which increases evaporation rate of reservoir (according to previous study, 1.1 m depth on average per year) [13].
Some hydropower systems offer flexibility of water storage, pump-storage HPP. In periods of lower demands, the water is rebounded to a reservoir with higher elevation, and, in periods of higher demand, the water is released by the turbines. In this case, the generation of hydroelectricity is less dependent on changes in the hydrological regime [4]. The limitations for the construction of these hydroelectric schemes in Brazil are related to the establishment of regulatory bases and economic viability.
Optimised operating rules can balance power generation [7,16,17,20,57]. An example of such operational policies would be raising and lowering reservoir level during some seasons. Haguma et al. [6] proposed as adaptive operational policies for Manicouagan Reservoir (Canada) the lowering in reservoir water level during winter and raising during spring. For the Furnas HPP reservoir (Brazil), Ribeiro Júnior et al. [51] proposed an operative rule that contemplates the time and the cycle of attendance to a certain level of the reservoir, to attend to the generation of energy and to guarantee the sustainability of multiple uses of water for the future climate.
Analyses indicate that hydroelectric managers usually consider historical hydro-meteorological data in the planning and design of new hydropower stations, but data should be also included on the possible impacts of climate change [14]. In Brazil, this new strategy is also necessary. With the inclusion of climate change impacts in planning, even if there are changes in flows, the plant can act in a balanced way, reducing losses in energy generation.
According to Lumbroso et al. [14], this strategic management leads to a set of possible options for hydroelectric schemes and impacts the amount of energy generated and future economic return. In Brazil, there is a need for climate and hydrological forecasting to anticipate hydrological risks and to assess the impacts and vulnerability of hydroelectric plants considering changes in climate and adaptation measures [30,51]. However, the influence of the actions taken is greater during the hydroelectric planning and design phases [14].
The diversification of the energy mix is considered a form of adaptation [13]. Thus, in Brazil, different sources of renewable energy can be managed in parallel:
Encouraging the use of solar and wind energy can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases and to Brazilian social and economic development [28]. Biomass as an energy source is also interesting due to the amount of waste from agriculture and forest products industries, extracted mainly from the sugar and alcohol industry [11,12].
Sources such as biomass (from bagasse and sugar cane straw) and wind power can contribute significantly to the generation of energy in periods with lower rainfall intensity, as it coincides with the more intense potential of these sources [8]. It can complement the generation of hydroelectricity in the period of greater fragility, especially the run-of-river hydropower plants.
The great annual variability in the hydrological conditions and the intense rain seasonality can put at risk the Brazilian hydrothermal energy generation system. However, a complementarity between hydroelectric, wind and solar photovoltaic systems could contribute to the stability of production and a decrease in thermoelectric generation [71].
7. Discussion
The assessment of projections of climate change allows better understanding of the magnitude of water and energy risks as well as the adoption of adaptation measures to meet future energy demands. The vulnerability and resilience of each hydroelectric plant depends on specific characteristics such as the type of plant (reservoir, pumped-storage or run-of-river), operating strategies, turbine resistance to sediments and the vulnerability of the hydrological regime.
Studies of the impact of climate change on the hydrological regime anticipated possible future developments, but interpretation should cover modelling uncertainties, especially related to climate change scenarios. These studies provided an overview of the trends and enable the establishment of hydroelectric reservoir management strategies. The impacts on the availability of water to the reservoirs can be predicted, which facilitates the designation of a plant operation strategy in order to mitigate the effects throughout the year or the adoption of other measures to guarantee demand to be met.
When establishing adaptive strategies, it is also necessary to investigate the impacts of adaptive actions on ecological integrity of rivers downstream of the reservoir, and there should be concerns related to maintenance of environmental flows, as highlighted in Spalding-Fecher et al. [5].
The analyses of the temperature and precipitation variables are fundamental in projections of climatic changes and in the evaluation of impacts on the generation of energy by hydroelectric plants. Precipitation directly influences the refilling of aquifers and river flow, i.e., the availability of water resources. Temperature influences the evaporation of the reservoir and the evapotranspiration of the vegetation—also impacting the availability of water in the reservoir. Variations in temperature also impact the behavior of other climatic variables (wind speed, humidity, precipitation). Investigations also highlighted the need for joint evaluation of temperature and precipitation, since evapotranspiration and evaporation may counterbalance precipitation [5,6,30]. That is, even if there is an increase in rainfall in some regions, higher temperature would increase the rates of evaporation of the reservoir and evapotranspiration in the basin, generating loss of water to the atmosphere. Other variables that can complement the analysis: demand for irrigation and land use—related to the silting of river banks and changes in evapotranspiration rates.
In Brazil, climate change trends indicate that the regions that will suffer the most changes will be the Amazon and the Northeast. Considering the Amazon, strategies should be implemented, due to the clear tendency, for the region, of construction of run-of-river plants, the kind of power plant in which the impacts of global warming are most significant. Considering the Northeast, in strategic terms, the country can opt for complementarity with the development of other renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar, given its enormous potential for generation, as evaluated in the study of Jong et al. [12].
Based on the study of several articles dealing with the impact of climate change on the management of hydropower reservoirs and other related articles, a framework was elaborated (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Framework—Climate change and reservoir management.
This research provides several conclusions related to climate and environmental changes in the context of hydropower reservoirs, which are useful for the academic and industry communities. A summary of the relationship between different variables is presented (see also Figure 3):
Global climate change affects power generation in hydropower reservoirs;
The increase in temperature causes changes in atmospheric pressure and wind patterns and consequently in precipitation and humidity patterns;
The combination of changes in precipitation and temperature affect the moisture levels of soil;
Increase of temperatures results in an increase in potential evaporation;
Changes in wind speed and humidity may compensate for or amplify the increase in temperature, which may interfere with the evaporation rate of the basin and reservoirs;
Precipitation is the climatic variable that most affects the flow of rivers;
Increased precipitation can lead to a rise in river flow; however, the increase in temperature may counterbalance the effect of this rise, as it increases the rate of evaporation of the reservoirs and the evapotranspiration in the basin;
Global warming increases the demand for water for agricultural exploitation (mainly irrigation) and other socio-environmental demands;
Changes in land cover alters the rate of evapotranspiration, which may imply changes in runoff characteristics;
Some changes in land cover can lead to soil degradation (silting), which can affect both the basin and the reservoir level due to sediment transport—aggravating the negative impacts of climate change;
Hydrological impacts vary according to: precipitation intensity, basin characteristics, type of vegetation and/or changes in land cover;
As a chain effect, changes in runoff can affect the production of electricity.
8. Conclusions
In summary, climatic and environmental variables impact the volume of water available for the generation of energy in hydropower reservoirs, hence the need for combined studies (considering these different variables) to develop reliable scenarios for the future availability of water resources for hydroelectric power generation and for the establishment of rules for flexible reservoir operation.

Hydropower: Economic Impact
The greatest benefit from the USACE hydropower program is the abundant low-cost energy the projects contribute to electric power grids. Because hydroelectric powerplants burn no fuel, operating costs are low and are immune to rising fossil fuel prices. In addition, most of these projects were built years ago, when construction costs were low. As a result, these plants are playing a significant role in keeping electricity costs affordable for consumers, creating a positive impact on the economy.
In most parts of the country, USACE hydropower plants can only meet a portion of an area's power needs. USACE strives to use this limited amount of energy in a way that will keep the overall cost of electricity to consumers as low as possible. This is often done by generating as much energy as possible during peak demand hours of the day. This saves consumers from having to rely on power produced at high cost oil- and gas-fired ""peaking"" plants.
In years of ample runoff, hydropower plants produce extra energy. This is used to displace more expensive generation at fossil-fuel powerplants, which further helps to reduce consumers’ electricity bills. Revenue from power sales is also repaid to the U.S. Treasury. From 2010 to 2016, average repayments were estimated at $1.23 billion per year.
USACE hydropower pays its own way. The full cost of building and operating these plants must be repaid, with interest, in fifty years. This includes a share of the dam, reservoir, spillway, and fish ladders costs.
USACE is the largest owner/operator of hydroelectric power plants in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world. The 75 USACE plants have a total installed rated capacity of nearly 22,000 megawatts and produce over 72 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year. This is one-fourth of the Nation’s total hydropower output: enough energy to serve about ten million households, or roughly ten cities the size of Seattle, WA.

­One of a kind dam
Chief Joseph Dam has the nation's longest straight-line powerhouse. At 2,039 feet, it's nearly one half mile long. Chief Joseph Dam is the nation's second leading producer of hydropower and the Corps of Engineers’ largest hydropower producer.
Shaped for power
The dam is 5,962 feet long in an area where the river is only 980 feet wide. The unique ""L"" shape enabled the Corps of Engineers to extend the powerhouse, providing room for additional generators. This design allows the power plant to take maximum advantage of the river for power production.
  Run of the river dam
Chief Joseph Dam is a ""run of the river"" dam which means the lake behind the dam is not able to store large amounts of water. Water coming to Chief Joseph Dam from Grand Coulee Dam must be passed on to Wells Dam at approximately the same rate. With 27 main generators in the powerhouse, it has the hydraulic capacity of 213,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1,593,000 gallons per second.
In the event more water was passed on to Chief Joseph Dam than could be used for power generation, the spillway gates would be opened to pass the excess water. With an average annual flow rate of 108,000 cfs, the Columbia River seldom exceeds the power plant's capability to pass water. Water spilling is infrequent at Chief Joseph Dam.
    Authority
Chief Joseph Dam was authorized as Foster Creek Dam and Powerhouse for hydroelectric power generation and irrigation by the River and Harbor Act of 1946 (H. Doc 693; P.L. 79-525, 79th Cong, 2nd Sess). The River and Harbor Act of 1948 (P.L. 80-858, 80th Cong, 2nd Sess) renamed the project Chief Joseph Dam in honor of the Nez Perce Chief and Statesman who lived his last years on the adjacent Colville Indian Reservation. The reservoir created by Chief Joseph Dam was designated Rufus Woods Lake in 1952 (P.L. 82-469, 82nd Cong, 2nd Sess). Recreation is authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1944 (P.L. 78-534).
Interesting facts about Chief Joseph Dam
About 2.2 million cubic yards of reinforced concrete was used to construct Chief Joseph Dam. That's enough concrete to build a two-lane highway between the dam and Salt Lake City, Utah.
Chief Joseph Dam has 27 main unit penstocks - one to deliver water to each generator. Each of these penstocks carries enough water to fill an Olympic - size swimming pool in seven seconds.
Chief Joseph Dam also has two small penstocks that supply water for two station service generators. The station service generators supply the power used to operate the dam.
There are 4.5 miles of galleries (passageways) in the dam.
The value of the electricity produced at Chief Joseph Dam is about $450 million annually.
Chief Joseph Dam has the nation's longest straight-line powerhouse. At 2039 feet, it's nearly one half mile long.
Chief Joseph Dam is the nation's second leading producer of hydropower.

Hydropower facts
Hydropower is more efficient than any other form of electrical generation.  It is capable of converting 90% of available energy into electricity. The best fossil fuel plant is only about 50% efficient.
Hydropower is a low cost alternative. On average, hydropower production costs one-third that of nuclear or fossil fuel production.
Hydropower can easily respond to power needs. Hydropower dams have the ability to be turned on and off quickly. Other forms of electrical production, such as a coal power, require a great deal of time to start or stop producing electricity.
Hydropower is a clean, reusable source of electricity. It produces no emissions and its fuel (water) can be used at each downstream dam.
Hydropower is domestic. Our supply of water is continually replenished through rain and snowmelt. We are not dependent upon foreign fuel supplies and their possible interruption.

State Water Project
A drone provides a view of a section of the California Aqueduct within the California State Water Project, located near John R. Teerink Pumping Plant.
The California State Water Project (SWP) is a multi-purpose water storage and delivery system that extends more than 705 miles -- two-thirds the length of California. A collection of canals, pipelines, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power facilities delivers clean water to 27 million Californians, 750,000 acres of farmland, and businesses throughout our state.
Planned, built, operated and maintained by DWR, the SWP is the nation’s largest state-owned water and power generator and user-financed water system. The project is considered an engineering marvel that has helped fuel California’s population boom and economic prosperity since its initial construction.
For the last 20 years, the California State Water Project’s average water is 34 percent for agricultural and 66 percent for residential, municipal, and industrial.
The State Water Project also plays an important role in efforts to combat climate change. Not only does it help California manage its water supply during extremes such as flooding and drought, it is also a major source of hydroelectric power deliveries for the State's power grid.
Benefits of the SWP
The primary purpose of the SWP is water supply delivery and flood control, but it provides many additional benefits, including:
Power generation
Recreation activities
Environmental stewardship
Planning for the Future
Now and in the future, the State Water Project will maintain its pivotal role in managing California’s water resources as we adapt to climate change. As California’s water landscape is changing, introducing new challenges, technologies, and possibilities, the SWP is dedicated in its commitment to the vision of being the most reliable, sustainable, and affordable water provider for the people and environment of California. In pursuit of this vision, the SWP has developed a risk-informed strategic approach known as “Elevate to ‘28” aimed at ensuring reliable water for the people and environment of California through 2028 and beyond. Elevate to ’28 delineates specific actions that the SWP will implement to address future challenges to secure a better future for California.

secret
Mr. Bevin suggested that the Chairman of the Deputies make a report.
Mr. Jebb stated that the Deputies had discussed the CFM agenda for today. It consisted of:
1.
The Italo-Austrian frontier;
2.
The Italo-French frontier;
3.
Limitations on the Italian Navy; and
4.
Certain items in the Balkan treaties.
With respect to the Italo-Austrian frontier the Deputies had considered the report of the Hydro-electric Experts.86 The U.S., U.K. and U.S.S.R. Deputies held the view that the report presented evidence that rectification of the frontier in favor of Austria would bring about economic sacrifice to Italy. The Soviet Deputy strongly felt that the Austrian claim should be set aside. The French Deputy believed that no new light had been brought to bear on the question by the report and that the question was a political one. He had therefore reserved his position. The report had not been formally
[Page 589]
approved by the Deputies but was referred to the CFM with the views of the Deputies.
With respect to the Italo-French frontier the Deputies had examined this question on the understanding that the CFM desired a brief report by the Hydro-electric Experts on the water power supply in the Mont Cenis area.87 They had instructed the Experts to examine the question of the guarantee which France should give to Italy to ensure that Italy would have the same water power facilities it enjoyed in the Mont Cenis area at the present time for hydroelectric purposes and that it should also consider the potential hydro-electric possibilities in the area. The Deputies had hoped that a preliminary report might have been drawn up by this morning. They had been advised, however, that the Experts had started their work last evening and continued it this morning but in view of the complexity of the problem certain of the Experts did not believe that it would be possible to draft an exact guarantee concerning the water supply for some time. They believed that they would be able to do so in three or four days.
With respect to limitations on the Italian Navy the Deputies had discussed this matter but had come to no agreement. Therefore they were submitting the report of the Naval Experts to the Ministers.88
With reference to the Balkan treaties the Deputies had taken out four items for the Ministers to discuss. These were contained in CFM(46)132.89
The Mont Cenis Area
M. Bidault expressed doubt in connection with one point on Mr. Jebb’s report, namely the question of power resources in the Mont Cenis area. The Deputies had agreed that the Hydro-electric Experts should report on the water supply there. The question of the potential power had been discarded and it would not be necessary for the Experts to study this matter any more than they should study potential electric power in Venezia Giulia or Lampedusa.
Mr. Jebb stated that there was some uncertainty among the Deputies on this point and he was not sure what had been decided. Perhaps it would be better to omit this point from the terms of reference.
[Page 590]
Mr. Bevin inquired whether the first paragraph of the terms of reference was approved and whether the Committee should limit itself to the question of the guarantee of water supply to Italy.
Mr. Byrnes stated that he did not object and suggested that the Deputies prepare such a guarantee. He wished to dispose of this section of the Deputies’ report since it had been agreed upon that the Mont Cenis area should be ceded to France if certain guarantees were adopted. The French had stated that they would give such guarantees.
M. Bidault stated that he would also agree.
The Austro-Italian Frontier
Mr. Bevin suggested that the CFM take up the matters in the Deputies’ report according to their order. The first one was the Italo-Austrian frontier after which they should discuss the Tenda-Briga area and then the question of guarantees for the Mont Cenis area.
M. Molotov proposed that the CFM adopt a resolution to the effect that the Ministers, having examined the report presented by the Hydro-electric Experts in connection with the Austrian claims for certain minor frontier rectifications in the northeastern part of the Alto-Adige area, cannot recognize the aforementioned claims as minor rectifications to the Austro-Italian frontier as suggested in the memorandum of the Government of Austria of May 30, 1946 (CFM(D)(46)92).90
Mr. Byrnes stated that the U.S. Delegation agreed to the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union.
M. Bidault stated that it was a thorny question. It did not represent a minor rectification. The main question appeared to be to permit Austria to have railroad transit rights from the northern to the eastern Tyrol. It was not a small area. M. Bidault believed that it should remain unchanged.
Mr. Bevin stated that the United Kingdom accepted the Soviet proposal. He expressed the hope that Italy and Austria would come to a common sense arrangement regarding railroad traffic. Mr. Byrnes stated that he understood that assurances in this connection had already been given. Italian laws existed granting such guarantees to Austria. If this were not so the CFM should consider measures in order to ensure such guarantees.
Mr. Bevin stated that according to his understanding Italy, under the 1919 treaty, had granted such guarantees. However, one or the other party had annulled them. In any event Italy and Austria should not put obstacles in the way of this railroad traffic for it
[Page 591]
was to the interests of their economy and earning power to have a free movement of traffic in this area.
Mr. Byrnes stated that the CFM, having agreed on the disposal of the area, might instruct the Committee of Experts to advise it if the guarantees existed. If they did not a clause might be drafted which would assure the fulfillment of what all the Ministers surely desired.
Mr. Bevin suggested that the Deputies might look into this question in order to ensure the free flow of traffic. He commented that one of the greatest assets of the area was its tourist traffic. There should be no impediments to this.
M. Molotov stated that the Soviet Delegation agreed to Mr. Byrnes’ proposal.
Franco-Italian Frontier—Tenda–Briga Area
Mr. Bevin stated that the Ministers had received the report of the Hydro-electric Committee which was a famous one since it had been agreed upon.91 The French reservation in the report had now been withdrawn.
M. Molotov stated that he wished to draw the Council’s attention to a memorandum of the Italian Government dated May 792 which had not been examined by the Ministers. According to this memorandum the Italian Government had stated that it was willing to come to agreement with the French Government in regard to frontier rectifications so as to make the frontier line coincide with the watershed line. It had also agreed to demilitarize the frontier along the Roya River and in the Mont Chaberton area and to state its views regarding the water resources of the Roya Valley. M. Molotov inquired whether it would not be advisable to examine this document before making a decision on the frontier.
M. Bidault stated that the position of the French Government was sufficiently known to the Ministers and that he saw no reason to repeat it again. The arguments of the Italian Government, as set forth in the memorandum, were not known to him in substance. He was prepared to have a decision on this question postponed once again if the Ministers desired to study this document. The French Delegation was accustomed to such postponements—although this was not a pleasant matter.
Mr. Byrnes stated that the United States Delegation was ready to dispose of the matter at once. He realized that consideration should be given to the Italian views. The United States Delegation had given full consideration to these views. It had considered the report of the
[Page 592]
Commission sent to the Tenda–Briga area;93 it had studied the communications of the Italian Government since that time. The United States Delegation was of the opinion that the disposition of the area, as had been suggested today, was the best one. This decision was to transfer the territory to France who should give the guarantees contained in the Expert’s report.
M. Bidault expressed his appreciation to Mr. Byrnes and stated that the guarantees to be given by France would be real guarantees.
Mr. Bevin stated that there were obviously two points of view; to settle the matter now or to postpone its settlement.
M. Molotov stated that the document to which he referred had been submitted by the Italian Government on May 7 and had not been discussed by the CFM or by any committee.
M. Bidault stated that he failed to understand. He had before him documents of May 27 and June 17. He inquired whether there was any other document on this question.
Mr. Byrnes referred to the June 17 document as the latest one and one that presented the Italian views six weeks after the document referred to by M. Molotov. The Ministers should believe that the June 17 document really presented the views of the Italian Government.
Mr. Bevin said that he understood that the two official documents circulated by the Secretariat were those of May 27 (CFM(D) (46)84) and June 17 (CFM(D) (46) 114).94 Other documents or memoranda that might have been distributed were submitted to the individual governments and not to the CFM. He inquired whether the May 7 document carried any number.
M. Molotov replied that it carried no conference number but that it carried No. 04034 of the Italian Embassy in Paris.
Mr. Byrnes stated that one of the documents received by the United States Delegation was the document referred to by M. Molotov. It was a memorandum sent under cover of a letter from the Italian Embassy. It was not addressed to the Council. There was no date on the memorandum. He continued that he entirely agreed that all the Delegates
[Page 593]
should consider the Italian views on this question. There was no doubt that the Italian Government opposed this transfer but the Council was obligated to make a decision. He hoped that it would do so. He would regret it if the decision did not comply with the wishes of the Italian Government but the Ministers should take this responsibility and settle the question.
Mr. Bevin stated that the United Kingdom had studied the Tenda–Briga question on the basis of four documents, i.e., (1) the report of the Commission sent there to study the situation on the spot; (2) the very important report of the Hydro-electric Experts; (3) and (4) the documents of May 27 and June 17 setting forth the Italian point of view. The United Kingdom had also studied the French point of view.
M. Molotov stated that all the Ministers recognized that it was a very complicated question. The memorandum of May 7 which was worthy of their attention dealt in part with the Tenda–Briga area. However the Ministers had not studied this memorandum or referred it to any committee. The Soviet Delegation respects the point of view presented by the French Delegation but it could not pass over the fact that this question was very important to Italy. All the electric power in the area before the war was utilized by large industrial enterprises in Italy. M. Molotov stated that he was calling attention to the May 7 document especially because it set forth a compromise which might facilitate the settlement of the question. For this reason the Soviet Delegation believed it advisable to instruct a committee to examine this document.
M. Bidault inquired exactly what document M. Molotov was referring to. Was it the one commencing “all geographers, historians, both Italian as well as foreigners”.
M. Molotov stated that he did not have the full text but only the conclusions.
M. Bidault inquired whether the conclusions started “although it is desired to state the Italian point of view”.
M. Molotov replied in the affirmative.
Mr. Byrnes stated that there was nothing new in the conclusions of the document. The Italian Government realized that there might be justification for certain frontier rectifications and had therefore offered to enter into negotiations with the French Government. After the document had been submitted the Italian Government had sent representatives who had appeared before the Deputies. They had set forth their views orally and had included them in a document eight pages long. He agreed that the Ministers must be careful to obtain the views of the Italian Government. If ever the CFM had gone out of its way to obtain such views it had done so in the present instance. A document had been submitted on May 7 and had been
[Page 594]
considered by the United States Delegation. On May 28 a new document had been submitted by the Italian Government. A commission had been sent to the territory under dispute to study the situation on the spot. On June 17 another document had been submitted by the Italian Government. It seemed to Mr. Byrnes that the Ministers were right in assuming that the proposals contained in the May 7 document were also contained in subsequent documents. They should go by the latter documents as containing the official views of the Italian Government. There was no need to go back to the May 7 document.
M. Molotov stated that Mr. Byrnes was correct in saying that the Italian Government had presented its views at a later stage. However, as far as he knew the May 7 document was the only one which had been presented which offered a compromise solution. Perhaps a settlement might be reached on this basis and the question should be examined accordingly. For that reason he proposed that the document be examined in order to ascertain whether there were any points of interest in it.
M. Bidault stated that so far as he was concerned he had no objection to making a very full examination of the document because it contained so many untrue factors that the French Delegation had no fear of it. As an example page seven of the document stated that the people of Tenda-Briga did not wish to unite with France. There was only one voice that opposed union. On page eight the total population of the area was given as 3800 inhabitants. With respect to electric power he recalled that the Experts had established that the electric output of the area did not reach one percent of the Italian output. These were the important factors that had raised so much difficulty among the Ministers. M. Bidault was confident that the French interest was a good one. He placed himself in the other Ministers’ hands and said that he had faith in their decision.
Mr. Bevin inquired whether it was the desire of the CFM to defer decision or to come to some conclusion at the present session. From a territorial point of view the British Delegation was not disturbed since it was a question of the transfer of a small population. The British Delegation thought that the hydro-electric report provided a basis for France and Italy to cooperate in an area in which both countries had great economic interests. If the guarantees were given by France to Italy Mr. Bevin was ready to come to a decision on the matter. He had examined the list of documents received by the Committee of Experts. The May 7 memorandum was not included. He had inquired of the British representative on the Committee whether all the arguments and proposals in the May 7 memorandum were known to them when they were drafting the report. From reading
[Page 595]
the report he was sure that all the pertinent arguments had been included, and that all the representatives on the Committee were well aware of them. Since the document had not been circulated to the CFM the compromise mentioned by M. Molotov had not been officially considered. He personally did not remember what the compromise was.
M. Bidault remarked that the compromise was to leave the entire area to Italy.
Mr. Bevin again inquired what the Ministers desired to do—to consider the matter further or to come to a decision. The French Delegation did not oppose reconsideration. The United States Delegation desired to decide the question now. The Soviet Delegation recommended further consideration.
Mr. Byrnes stated that even if the Ministers overlooked the statements in the more recent documents and examined the May 7 document they would see that there was a compromise. The Italian Government had offered to cede area No. 1. This point had already been decided by the Ministers. The Italians had suggested ceding the hunting grounds. That point had also been decided by the Ministers. The Italians were willing to demilitarize the area marked as No. 3 on the map. The Council had decided to cede area No. 3 to France. The Italians had then said that they would negotiate regarding the Mont Cenis area. The Ministers had gone into this question, guarantees had been promised by France and the matter settled.
With respect to area No. 4 the Italian Government said that it would negotiate with France the question of the utility of the electric power in the area. The CFM had sent a commission to the area which had made a unanimous report. This report had been adopted by the Council. The only compromise mentioned by the Italians referred to area No. 4. The CFM had studied this matter, i.e., the question of electric power and had come to a decision on it. Mr. Byrnes believed that it should stand by its decision. He expressed the hope that it would not postpone action and that it would decide the question today. He inquired whether France had had any negotiations with Italy on the question of electric power in this area.
M. Bidault replied that France had carried on negotiations for six months on the question. If the question of a compromise solution came up he wished to mention that France had negotiated much wider claims with Italy regarding more important population groups than in the Tenda-Briga area.
M. Molotov stated that he did not propose that the question be referred to Italy and France for settlement. Perhaps Mr. Byrnes was correct when he said that the proposal contained in the May 7 memorandum related to an inadequate compromise. That was not the point.
[Page 596]
The point was that this document had not been examined. For that reason the Ministers should instruct a special committee to give consideration to the views contained in this document. They should not confine their consideration to the views of the Italian Government but should endeavor to find a compromise which would be acceptable to the French Government and one that would not have too an adverse effect on Italy.
M. Bidault suggested that the CFM adjourn until 5:00 p.m. Mr. Byrnes said that before adjourning he wished to suggest that the Council itself consider the memorandum of May 7. He did not wish to set up another commission. Two commissions had already worked on this question and the establishment of a third would not facilitate matters. The question of the Tenda–Briga area must be decided by the CFM and he suggested that it do so this afternoon. The May 7 document proposed the rectifications of areas Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. Three of these four areas had been settled. If the Ministers reverted to the May 7 document and established a new committee the entire problem would be opened up again. This would be a step backwards and not forwards. The Deputies had considered this matter for months and had heard all the interested parties. They had reported accordingly to the Ministers. It would not help to appoint another committee. If the Deputies were unable to find a compromise in their months of work there was no reason to believe that such a compromise could be found by a committee which would work on this problem for two or three days. If it was so desired and if the May 7 document was so important he was willing to study it. This question must be settled eventually and he suggested that it be done this afternoon. He proposed that the Ministers should read the May 7 document, see what was in it and discuss the matter when they met.
M. Molotov inquired why the matter had to be settled today and not in the next few days after the proposal had been examined.
Mr. Byrnes again suggested that M. Molotov study the document during the recess and discuss it at the afternoon session with a view to reaching agreement.
M. Molotov stated that he had no objection to studying the document or to referring it to a committee. However some more time would be needed for this.
Mr. Bevin suggested that the Deputies study the document and report back to the CFM whether there were any arguments contained in it which it had not already considered.
Mr. Byrnes stated that he did not agree. He did not wish to refer back to the Deputies a document which they had received last May.

At their 57th Meeting, May 30, 1946, the Deputies heard statements by the Austrian Foreign Minister, Karl Gruber, and by the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Nicolo Carandini, on the subject of the rectification of the Austro-Italian frontier in the South Tyrol. At their 66th Meeting, June 7, 1946, the Deputies decided to establish a Committee of Hyro-Electric Experts to consider the hydro-electric questions raised by the request by Austria for a rectification of the Austro-Italian frontier. The Committee’s Report, designated C.F.M. (46) 120, June 20, 1946, is printed on p. 563. In telegram 2782, Delsec 561, June 8, from Paris, Dunn reported as follows on the discussion by the Deputies regarding the Austrian territorial claims:
“Austrian claim to Pusterthal and Brixen discussed by Deputies June 7. No decision was taken on (1) whether Austrian claim could be considered as minor rectification within September CFM decision, or (2) merits of the claim. French Deputy called attention to Gruber’s statement before CFM May 30 in which he said Austria, while making claim now only to part of South Tyrol in accordance with CFM decision, would later raise question on whole South Tyrol before appropriate international body. Couve said that since CFM had task of establishing conditions of peace in Europe, solution of question adopted by CFM should be final. Couve also said decision on Austrian claim should be based not on whether it is ‘minor rectification’ but on whether Four Powers consider it desirable to give Austria something; he said Austria should be given Eisackthal and Pusterthal, perhaps also Brixen, or else nothing at all, and settlement should be final. Jebb gave British view that claim including Brixen could not be considered as minor rectification, intimating that he regarded claim excluding Brixen as within definition. I said US had not yet come to any conclusion on that point. Gusev did not think Austrian claim was for minor rectification but was willing to have it studied on its merits.” (740.00119 Council/6–846)

Ambassador di Soragna’s statement set forth the views of the Italian Government on the Report of the Commission of Experts (C.F.M. (46) 56, May 11, 1946, p. 353) on the question of the rectification of the Franco-Italian frontier in the Upper Valley of the Roya. The Deputies, at their 52nd Meeting, May 16, 1946, had decided to invite the Italian Government to send a representative to make such a statement in pursuance of the views of the members of the Council of Foreign Ministers at its 16th Meeting, May 14, 1946; see the United States Delegation Record of that Council meeting, p. 368. C.F.M.(D) (46) 114, June 19, 1946, not printed, was the text of a note from the Italian Embassy in Paris to the Council of Foreign Ministers, dated June 17, 1946, which set forth the views of the Italian Government with regard to the other rectifications in the Franco-Italian frontier proposed by the French Government.↩

Norway's energy supply system Electricity production
Norway has the highest share of electricity produced from renewable sources in Europe, and the lowest emissions from the power sector.
Hydropower Wind power Solar power Thermal power plants The power balance
In the beginning of 2023, the power supply in Norway had a total installed production capacity of 39 703 MW. In a normal year, the Norwegian power plants produce about 156 TWh. In 2021, Norway set a new production record with a total power production of 157.1 TWh. In 2022, there was low levels of water inflow to the reservoirs, and the total power production was 146.1 TWh.
1769 HYDROPOWER PLANTS
About 88% of Norwegian production capacity
1240 STORAGE RESERVOIRS
Total storage capacity is 87 TWh
65 WIND FARMS
About 11% of Norwegian production capacity
Features of the Norwegian power supply system
Hydropower accounts for most of the Norwegian power supply, and the resource base for production depends on the precipitation in a given year. This is a significant difference compared to the rest of Europe where security of supply is mainly secured through thermal power plants, with fuels available in the energy markets.
A special feature of the Norwegian hydropower system is its high storage capacity. Norway has half of Europe’s reservoir storage capacity, and more than 75 % of Norwegian production capacity is flexible. Production can be rapidly increased and decreased as needed, at low cost. This is important because there must be a balance between production and consumption at all times in the power system. The growing share of intermittent production technologies, such as wind and solar, makes it even more vital that there is flexibility available in the rest of the system.
The power market in Norway was deregulated in 1991, when few countries had market-based power systems. The market is now a fundamental element of the Norwegian power supply. Electricity prices provide long-term investment signals and play an important part in short-term balancing of supply, demand and transmission.
Renewable power plants are generally located where there is access to resources. Production capacity is therefore unequally distributed between different regions of Norway. A well-developed power grid is vital for transmitting electricity to consumers in all parts of the country.
The Norwegian power system is closely integrated with the other Nordic systems, both in physical terms and through market integration. In turn, the Nordic market is integrated with the rest of Europe through cross-border interconnectors to the Netherlands, Germany, the Baltic states and Poland. Integration with other countries’ power systems, the well-developed power grid and the characteristics of hydropower production make Norway’s power supply system very flexible, reducing vulnerability to fluctuations in production between seasons and years.
HYDROPOWER
Hydropower is still the mainstay of the Norwegian electricity system. At the beginning of 2023, there were 1 769 hydropower plants in Norway, with a combined installed capacity of 33 691 MW. In a normal year, the Norwegian hydropower plants produce 136.49 TWh, which is about 88% of Norway’s total power production.
Water inflow and installed capacity determine how much hydropower the Norwegian system can produce. Inflow varies considerably during the year and from one year to another. The water inflow is highest during the spring, normally declines towards the end of summer but increases again during the autumn. Inflow is generally very low in the winter months.
Norway has more than 1240 hydropower storage reservoirs with a total capacity of 87 TWh. The 30 largest reservoirs provide about half the storage capacity. Total reservoir capacity corresponds to 70% of annual Norwegian electricity consumption. Most of the reservoirs were constructed before 1990. Upgrading and expansion of hydropower plants has made it possible to utilize the reservoirs more fully.

Flexible and intermittent capacity
Electricity production capacity is generally split into two categories, flexible and intermittent. If production is flexible, power plants can adjust production to market developments. Many power plants in Norway have storage reservoirs and production can therefore be adjusted within the constraints set by the licence and the watercourse itself.
Wind and solar power are intermittent; electricity can only be generated when the energy is available. The same applies to run-of-river power plants and small-scale hydropower plants. However a number of the large run-of-river power plants in Norway lie downstream of storage hydropower plants in the same river system, and this influences their production patterns. Some small hydropower plants make use of the head of water between reservoirs.
More than 75 % of Norway’s production capacity is flexible.
By using storage reservoirs, flexible hydropower plants can produce electricity even in periods when there is little precipitation and inflow is low. The large available reservoir storage capacity makes it possible to even out production over years, seasons, weeks and days, within the constraints set by the licence and the watercourse itself.
A high proportion of the energy used for heating in Norway is electricity, and electricity prices and production from storage hydropower plants are therefore generally highest in winter.
Production of intermittent hydropower automatically varies with changes in water inflow. Production is high during spring and summer, when consumption is lowest.
The flexibility of power plants and reservoirs varies. Some hydropower plants with small reservoirs offer short-term flexibility, and can transfer production from base-load hours (at night) to peak-load hours (daytime). Hydropower plants with larger reservoirs can store water for longer periods so that they produce electricity in winter, when consumption and prices are highest. Norway’s largest reservoir, Blåsjø, has a capacity of 7.8 TWh and can hold three years’ normal inflow. However, when the hydropower plants are working at full capacity, the reservoir could be emptied in 7–8 months. Very large reservoirs like Blåsjø are intended to store water in years when precipitation is high for use in drier years. Much of Norway’s reservoir capacity is concentrated in the mountains in the southern half of the country (in the counties Telemark, Rogaland, Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane), and further north in Nordland.
Reservoirs make it possible to manage water use to maximise income from the available water resources. For society as a whole, the aim is to spread production so as to make optimal use of water inflow over the year, or in some cases over several years. To ensure that this happens, there must be financial incentives for producers that reflect the underlying physical conditions. The market therefore plays an important part in ensuring efficient management of water stored in the reservoirs.
Market adaptation by producers
The variable costs of hydropower production are low, since water, the actual energy source, is free. An owner of a run-of-river power plant will therefore be willing to generate electricity even if the prices is only just above zero. The same principle applies to intermittent production technologies such as wind and solar power. Intermittent production is generally independent of price, but varies with weather conditions. Thermal power production, for example at coal-fired, gas-fired and nuclear power plants, is profitable provided that the electricity price covers the production costs at the time of production. These depend to a large degree on the prices of coal, gas and CO2 emission allowances.
Hydropower producers who can store water will assess the situation differently. They constantly need to consider whether to produce electricity immediately, or to retain the water in reservoirs. It is the difference between the current and the expected electricity price that determines whether it is profitable to store water for short or longer periods.
It is challenging to manage storage reservoirs, because it is impossible to be sure how inflow will vary in future or how market conditions will develop. Reservoir management therefore requires considerable local knowledge and the ability to interpret changing, complex and uncertain information on inflow, consumption and market developments.
At Norwegian storage hydropower plants, production is also regulated in line with short-term price developments, which are closely related to the volume of intermittent power production in the other Nordic countries and the rest of Europe.
It is also necessary to maintain a balance in the power supply system as a whole as production and consumption change during the day and within each hour. Hydropower production can be rapidly regulated up and down at relatively low cost. In thermal power plants, on the other hand, it can be time-consuming and costly to regulate production. This means that Norwegian power plants are useful for meeting the short-term need for flexibility, which is growing because the share of intermittent production is increasing in Nordic and other European power supply systems. Well-functioning, integrated markets and a well-developed power grid are an essential basis for this.
WIND POWER
At the beginning of 2023, there were 65 wind farms in Norway, with an installed capacity of 5073 MW. This corresponds to about 16.9 TWh in a normal year. Production from wind power plants fluctuates with weather conditions. Wind conditions can vary a lot between days, weeks and months.
SOLAR POWER
At the beginning of 2023, the total installed capacity of solar power was 299 MW in Norway. In 2023, more than 90% of the installed capacity was connected to the Norwegian power grid. About 5% of the solar power in Norway had an installed capacity of more than 50 kW in 2023. In 2023, most of the solar power in Norway is installed on the roofs of households and industry, and primarily cover their own consumption. As of 31 March 2023, there are no dedicated solar power plants in Norway. During 2022, approximately 153 MW of new solar power was installed in Norway.

THERMAL POWER PLANTS
Norway’s thermal power plants accounted for about 1.5% of the total production capacity in 2023. Many of the power plants are located in large industrial installations that use the electricity generated themselves. Hence, production often depends on the electricity needs of the industry. These power plants use a variety of energy sources, including municipal waste, industrial waste, surplus heat, oil, natural gas and coal. There are 30 thermal power plants in Norway, with a total installed capacity of about 642 MW.
THE POWER BALANCE
The power balance expresses the relationship between production and consumption and indicates whether the Norwegian power system is a net exporter or importer in a particular year. There are wide variations from year to year. Generally, consumption fluctuates with temperature and production with water inflow and wind conditions. The underlying situation in the Norwegian power supply system can be illustrated by comparing Norwegian production capacity in a normal year with electricity consumption corrected for temperature, as in the figure below.
At the beginning of the 1990s, there was a considerable surplus in the Norwegian power supply system, which became apparent when the market was deregulated. This was followed by a period of falling investments in new electricity production and relatively high growth in consumption, resulting in a reduction in the power surplus by the early 2000s. After the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the power surplus has increased again as a result of weaker growth in consumption and higher electricity production. In 2022, Norway had a power surplus of 12.5 TWh. There is great uncertainty in how the power surplus will evolve in the years to come, and this depends on a wide range of factors. In the years to come, a high increase in power consumption is expected, which may contribute to a lower power surplus.

First Nations and Hydropower: The Case of British Columbia’s Site C Dam Project
This “Just Environments” contribution from Rick Hendriks, Philip Raphals, Karen Bakker, and Gordon Christie focuses on the adverse environmental, socio-legal, and economic impacts of Site C, a large-scale hydropower project in British Columbia. Based on in-depth analysis, the authors suggest that construction of Site C would violate First Nations Treaty rights, result in a loss of biodiversity, and generate greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, Site C is more expensive than other renewable alternatives. They call for the cancellation of the Site C project, raising broader questions about the role of hydropower in a carbon-constrained world.

Over the past several decades, large-scale hydropower projects have sparked significant debates around the world. Displacement of Indigenous peoples and environmental impacts are major sources of concern, as are the economics of dam mega-projects. The World Commission on Dams emphasized these concerns over a decade ago, and many countries and international organizations (such as the World Bank) overhauled their hydropower policies as a result. Some countries even entered a new post-dam era: the US Bureau of Engineers, a champion of building big dams in the twentieth century, has refocused on dam decommissioning and environmental restoration.
“The project’s unresolved infringement on Treaty rights, combined with the weak economics and unprecedented environmental impacts, make a strong case for canceling the project.”
In Canada, recent large-scale hydropower projects have raised substantive concerns. As illustrated here by the Site C Project case, these concerns are well justified. Our research indicates that Site C is more expensive, more environmentally damaging, less greenhouse-gas friendly, and generates fewer jobs than twenty-first-century renewables such as wind power (combined with common-sense conservation). The project’s unresolved infringement on Treaty rights, combined with the weak economics and unprecedented environmental impacts, make a strong case for canceling the project. Most troubling: these issues were not properly studied in the regulatory review process due to governmental evasion of comprehensive economic and environmental assessments of Site C.
British Columbia’s Site C Project
Site C is the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken by the province of British Columbia: originally budgeted at C$8.3 billion, the project cost is now estimated at C$10 billion, with further cost overruns likely. Site C is in the early stages of construction on the Peace River in northeastern British Columbia and is designed to produce 1100 MW of capacity and 5100 GWh/year of energy, starting in 2024. Supporters of the project—notably the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (BC Hydro), the provincial Crown corporation developing the project—have promoted it as “clean, green energy.”
Over the past eighteen months, the University of British Columbia’s Program on Water Governance published six research reports on Site C and made six technical submissions to the British Columbia Utilities Commission (BCUC). This article summarizes some key findings from this research with the goal of contributing to the ongoing public debate on the project. We believe that our research fills an important gap because the previous provincial government exempted Site C from review by the BCUC (the utility board responsible for regulating BC Hydro). This exemption occurred despite the fact that the federal and provincial government’s own environmental Joint Review Panel recommended review by the BCUC.1
Recently, the new provincial government instigated a BCUC inquiry into Site C and asked the Commission to consider whether Site C should be halted. The results of the BCUC report, which cited our research extensively, all point in the same direction: there is a strong case for cancelling the Site C project on socio-legal, environmental, and economic grounds.2
Treaty rights infringement not adequately assessed
Indigenous communities have repeatedly highlighted how Site C would severely impact Treaty rights by flooding large sections of the Peace River Valley (already extensively affected by previous hydroelectric development). However, the question of Treaty rights infringement was excluded from the mandate of the environmental review panel appointed by the provincial and federal governments, forcing the affected Treaty 8 First Nations to pursue the matter in the courts. The British Columbia Court of Appeal and the Federal Court of Appeal recently ruled that the Crown could proceed with Site C without assessing possible Treaty rights violations. This is seemingly at odds with the government’s commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, and its commitment to implement the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples—which requires free, prior, and informed consent.
While these court cases were concluded this year, the underlying legal matter remains unresolved.3 There was no resolution to the question of the infringement of Treaty rights, and both courts noted questions of infringement should be addressed in a separate standalone action. Indigenous leaders have condemned this “build first, litigate during, and compensate after” approach as failing to honor treaties, and a betrayal of the “honour of the Crown.”4 In brief: Government officials claimed Indigenous rights would be handled fairly by the regulatory process. This has not been the case. The way it has been handled belies the federal and provincial governments’ stated commitment to meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Canada. Legal experts agree a new Supreme Court of Canada case is now likely. While there is no case currently before the courts that could end up at the Supreme Court of Canada, West Moberly and Prophet River First Nations have said they have prepared but not filed such an infringement claim,5 which the BCUC considers an economic risk to the future of the Site C project.6 This raises potential future risk of a major cost award, which has not been factored into the economic assessment of the project.
Significant environmental concerns
Our research reveals Site C will have more significant environmental impacts than any project ever approved under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (Table 1). This finding may seem surprising, but it arises because of the incredible biodiversity of Peace River Valley, which plays a key role in the ecology of the northeastern part of British Columbia, as well as a vital role in enabling First Nations Treaty rights to be fulfilled.

“This environmental threat led UNESCO to note in a 2017 recent review that it intended to designate the Delta as a World Heritage Site in Danger…”
There are also likely to be environmental impacts downstream, including on the Peace-Athabasca Delta (located largely inside Wood Buffalo National Park), which is the largest inland freshwater delta in North America, of tremendous significance for a range of wildlife (including migrating birds), and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This environmental threat led UNESCO to note in a 2017 recent review that it intended to designate the Delta as a World Heritage Site in Danger, unless certain steps are taken—including a detailed review of the potential impacts of Site C on the Delta.8
The Site C construction and reservoir will also generate greenhouse gas emissions, estimated by BC Hydro between 5 and 7 million metric tons over the first thirty years of operations (equivalent to adding some 50,000 cars to BC roads over that period). In fact, our research shows Site C’s emissions would actually exceed those from a lower-cost alternative portfolio of additional energy conservation, wind, and natural gas operated to meet only winter-peak requirements.9
Weak economics
Our research indicates, and the BC Utilities Commission report confirms, that the economic case for Site C is weak. Since Site C was approved, BC Hydro’s forecast of future electricity demand has dropped substantially. Based on their reference scenario, the electricity produced by Site C will be 100 percent surplus upon commissioning and not fully required for at least a decade. Obviously, this date will be much later if demand growth is lower than forecast. Given BC Hydro’s consistent pattern of overestimating future demand, the BCUC indicated that demand is likely to be lower than predicted by BC Hydro.
Site C is poised to generate a surplus long-term. This surplus will be exported into markets where, due to low natural gas prices and technological innovation, electricity prices are far below the cost of production from Site C. As a result, the surplus will be sold at a loss. The BCUC confirmed that Site C electricity would have to be exported at a significant loss, given that the cost of production is currently approximately three times higher than the export market price. We estimate the cumulative value of these losses at C$930 million, using BC Hydro’s forecast reference scenario, or over C$2 billion, using a low-demand scenario.
Site C is also more expensive than other renewables. Our research found that an alternative plan—combining wind energy and inexpensive energy conservation—would be hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps even billions of dollars, less expensive. Based on available information and model assumptions, cancelling Site C is preferable to completion.10 The BCUC’s report, supported by an independent review by Deloitte, is aligned with our findings.
“Our analysis indicates that Site C provides the least number of jobs.”
Site C also generates fewer jobs than the alternatives. Our most recent report analyzed the number of jobs Site C would provide versus the alternative portfolios (which entail significant amounts of energy conservation, as well as alternative energy sources such as wind and geothermal) put forward by BC Hydro and the BCUC. Our analysis indicates that Site C provides the least number of jobs. Pursuing an alternate path would allow many more long-term sustainable jobs to be generated in the Peace Valley region. There would also be no net loss of jobs: Remediation of the site would absorb the current Site C workers for two years, after which workers could be transitioned to energy conservation (which generates 30 jobs per $1 million spent, and provides electricity at only a third the cost of Site C). We estimated the jobs at 2,400 per year. Longer-term, the installation of new alternative energy facilities (notably wind in the Peace River region, which is the most promising region in British Columbia for wind power) would create an even higher number of jobs.
Regulatory process: Systemic shortcomings
Our research also points to systemic shortcomings in the regulatory process for Site C: a failure to consider the evolving framework of Indigenous rights and an overly constrained environmental assessment process.
Failure to consider Indigenous rights
As outlined above, the current legal regime in Canada provides insufficient safeguards for ensuring water security for Indigenous peoples, and as a result, conflict continues to grow. Recently, Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde toured the proposed Site C Project site at the invitation of West Moberly and other local First Nations communities. Yet, BC is not an isolated case. In Alberta, for example, conflict over water allocations to First Nation’s reserves is intensifying.11
Underpinning these disputes are two different worldviews. At the risk of oversimplification: whereas Western law frames water as a resource available for human exploitation, Indigenous laws frame water as an animate (living) entity that, like other elements of nature, is rights-bearing, imbued with sociocultural and spiritual meaning, and interrelated with all aspects of the environment.12
However, there remains optimism that there are ways to navigate and negotiate these differing and arguably incommensurate understandings. Many Indigenous communities welcome recent language by the federal government that characterizes these sorts of negotiations as nation-to-nation and respects Indigenous relations to water.13 Expectations are high in First Nations communities that proper processes will be deployed to honor the spirit and intent of treaty arrangements. But, the provincial and federal governments’ decision to proceed with Site C despite ongoing court cases have not met these expectations.
“While these legal and political struggles unfold, some Indigenous communities have taken the initiative to develop their own policies for resource governance.”
While these legal and political struggles unfold, some Indigenous communities have taken the initiative to develop their own policies for resource governance.14 A related trend has been toward increased involvement of Indigenous peoples in collaborative water governance, in line with broader trends of community participation in decision-making at the watershed scale, notably via the Northwest Territories Water Stewardship Strategy.15 This parallels calls by industry for new approaches to resource management.
These developments and initiatives are characterized by shared recognition that current approaches to consultation are unsatisfactory. These mechanisms, meanwhile, are likely to undergo significant transformation in the near future, given the federal government’s ongoing commitments to overhauling its environmental assessment processes and to implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In the background to all this activity, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples has been a top priority in Ministerial mandates.
To effectively ignore First Nation’s concerns and push ahead with an economically flawed and environmentally damaging hydroelectric project is an unwise move. In the particular context of the Site C Project, while Treaty rights and responsibilities are equally shared by both sides, one party seems intent on forcing the other into costly and time-consuming litigation. As Canadian courts have pressed for decades, these sorts of contentious matters are best worked out in good-faith negotiations. Hitting “pause” would have provided the federal Department of Justice with an opportunity to conduct a full assessment of the project’s effects on constitutionally protected Treaty rights and for the Treaty parties to find consensus-based solutions.
Constrained environmental assessment
In May 2011, the Site C Project triggered an environmental assessment under the former 1992 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, which was superseded by the 2012 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA 2012). The Site C Project was also reviewable under the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Act.
In February 2012, the federal and provincial Ministers of Environment finalized an agreement to conduct a cooperative environmental assessment, including the establishment of a joint review panel (JRP). The Panel Agreement imposed several time and resource constraints on the work of the three-person JRP, including in relation to the review of over 27,000 pages of technical documentation and the review deadline. While it is not unusual for environmental assessments to include large volumes of material, it is unusual for a review of a large-scale hydroelectric project by an independent panel to occur over a nine-month period.16
The implications of the JRP’s time and resource constraints are evident in the Panel’s findings related to Site C’s cost—a central consideration in evaluating it relative to the available alternatives—a key mandate and responsibility of the JRP in the EIS Guidelines:
The Panel cannot conclude on the likely accuracy of Project cost estimates because it does not have the information, time, or resources. This affects all further calculations of unit costs, revenue requirements, and rates. 17
Another implication concerns the findings of the JRP regarding the relative greenhouse gas emissions of the Site C Project compared to the alternatives. Due to time constraints, the Panel dedicated one afternoon session to atmospheric issues, of which greenhouse house gases was one of five subtopics in a four-hour hearing. No evidence concerning greenhouse gas emissions was presented to the Panel during the hearing, other than by BC Hydro.
“Future environmental reviews should be properly resourced in order to ensure that the full facts and analysis can be made available to decision-makers.”
The decision to impose significant constraints on the environmental review created a situation in which a comprehensive analysis of the relevant facts could not be provided. The JRP did an admirable job under different circumstances. However, future environmental reviews should be properly resourced in order to ensure that the full facts and analysis can be made available to decision-makers.
Looking ahead: The role of hydropower in Canada’s energy future
The provincial government will render its decision on Site C in the coming weeks. In our opinion, the research points in a clear direction: cancellation of the Site C project makes sense on economic, jobs, environmental, and social grounds. Specifically, our research indicates Site C is more expensive, more environmentally damaging, less greenhouse-gas friendly, and generates fewer jobs than twenty-first-century renewables such as wind power (combined with common-sense conservation). The project’s unresolved infringement on Treaty rights, combined with the weak economics and unprecedented environmental impacts, make a strong case for its cancellation.
Regardless of the outcome, the case of Site C raises broader issues, which our assessment highlights: infringement on First Nations’ Treaty rights, significant adverse environmental effects, a weak business case, and a constrained regulatory process that did not address many of the key issues at stake. Similar concerns have been raised with respect to the other two major hydropower projects currently under construction in Canada: Keeyask in Manitoba and Muskrat Falls in Labrador.
In turn, this raises the question of hydropower’s role in Canada’s energy future. Our research provides a strong basis for sustained analysis and debate on the need to overhaul regulatory processes for hydropower projects at both provincial and federal levels; and on the comparative merits of other renewables versus hydropower (including small-scale hydropower, such as pumped storage). Canada needs to give future hydropower projects a more thorough, comprehensive analysis than they received in the past. And, we urgently need to implement the new, innovative options—such as wind power—that are more appropriate to Canada’s twenty-first-century energy needs in a carbon-constrained world.

Energy
About 85% of the total primary energy supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources. This is the highest share of renewable energy in any national total energy budget.
In 2016 geothermal energy provided about 65% of primary energy, the share of hydropower was 20%, and the share of fossil fuels (mainly oil products for the transport sector) was 15%. In 2013 Iceland also became a producer of wind energy. The main use of geothermal energy is for space heating, with the heat being distributed to buildings through extensive district-heating systems. About 85% of all houses in Iceland are heated with geothermal energy.
In 2015, the total electricity consumption in Iceland was 18,798 GWh. Renewable energy provided almost 100% of electricity production, with about 73% coming from hydropower and 27% from geothermal power. Most of the hydropower plants are owned by Landsvirkjun (the National Power Company) which is the main supplier of electricity in Iceland. Iceland is the world's largest green energy producer per capita and largest electricity producer per capita, with approximately 55,000 kWh per person per year. In comparison, the EU average is less than 6,000 kWh.
Master Plan
A master plan comparing the economic feasibility and the environmental impact of the proposed power development projects is being prepared. It is hoped that this comparison will aid in the selection of the most feasible projects to develop, considering both the economic and environmental impact of such decisions.

For the second time Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation seeks to review in this court an order1  of the Federal Power Commission which will reduce the rates which it may charge for electric energy transmitted in interstate commerce. In the instant case the Federal Commission ruled that it possessed the power to regulate Safe Harbor's rates under Section 20, Part I, and also under Sections 205 and 206, Part II of the Federal Power Act and ordered a substantial rate reduction.2 
The circumstances of Safe Harbor's operations are referred to in our earlier opinion, 3 Cir., 124 F.2d 800, certiorari denied 316 U.S. 663, 62 S. Ct. 943, 86 L. Ed. 1740, and need not be detailed here. It will be necessary to read that opinion in conjunction with this. We think it is sufficient presently to state that we held in our earlier opinion that the Commission was without jurisdiction to regulate Safe Harbor's rates under Section 20, Part I of the Federal Power Act, because it had not found that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland were unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the rates to be charged by Safe Harbor for the sale of the electric energy generated and transmitted by it in interstate commerce wholesale. The Commission had not relied upon Part II of the Federal Power Act in its earlier proceedings and the provisions of that Part were not before us. We now hold that the Federal Commission possesses the power to regulate Safe Harbor's rates under the provisions of Part II of the Federal Power Act and that the Commission in making the regulatory order of November 4, 1946, employed a rate base formula authorized by the Federal Power Act and has allowed Safe Harbor a fair rate of return.
I. Applicable Statutory Provisions and Jurisdiction.
A. Did the Federal Commission have jurisdiction under Part II of the Federal Power Act to regulate Safe Harbor's rates and is Section 20, Part I, inconsistent with or repealed by implication by Part II? Repeals by implication are not favored. United States v. Jackson, 302 U.S. 628, 631, 58 S. Ct. 390, 82 L. Ed. 488; United States v. Borden Company, 308 U.S. 188, 198, 60 S. Ct. 182, 84 L. Ed. 181. Safe Harbor holds a fifty year license issued by the Commission on April 22, 1930, under Section 4(e) of the Federal Water Power Act of 1920.3  The provisions of Parts II and III of the Federal Power Act did not become effective until August 26, 1935.4  Section 28 of the Federal Water Power Act, incorporated without change into the Federal Power Act as Section 28, Part I,5  provided that though the right to alter, amend or repeal the provisions of the Act was expressly reserved by Congress no alteration, amendment or repeal should affect any license issued under the Act or the rights of licensees thereunder. Section 20 of the Federal Water Power Act, incorporated without change as Section 20, Part I, of the Federal Power Act, provided ""That when said power or any part thereof shall enter into interstate or foreign commerce the rates charged and the service rendered by any such licensee, or by any subsidiary corporation, the stock of which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such licensee, or by any person, corporation, or association purchasing power from such licensee for sale and distribution or use in public service shall be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and just to the customer and all unreasonable discriminatory and unjust rates or services are hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful; and whenever any of the States directly concerned has not provided a commission or other authority to enforce the requirements of this section within such State or to regulate and control the amount and character of securities to be issued by any of such parties, or such States are unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the services to be rendered, or on the rates or charges of payment therefor, or on the amount or character of securities to be issued by any of said parties, jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the commission, upon complaint of any person aggrieved, upon the request of any State concerned, or upon its own initiative to enforce the provisions of this section, to regulate and control so much of the services rendered, and of the rates and charges of payment therefor as constitute interstate or foreign commerce and to regulate the issuance of securities by the parties included within this section, and securities issued by the licensee subject to such regulations shall be allowed only for the bona fide purpose of financing and conducting the business of such licensee.
""The administration of the provisions of this section, so far as applicable, shall be according to the procedure and practice in fixing and regulating the rates, charges, and practices of railroad companies as provided in the Act to regulate commerce, approved February 4, 1887, as amended, and that the parties subject to such regulation shall have the same rights of hearing, defense, and review as said companies in such cases.
""In any valuation of the property of any licensee hereunder for purposes of rate making, no value shall be claimed by the licensee or allowed by the commission for any project or projects under license in excess6  of the value or values prescribed in section 14 hereof for the purposes of purchase by the United States, but there shall be included the cost to such licensee of the construction of the lock or locks or other aids of navigation and all other capital expenditures required by the United States, and no value shall be claimed or allowed for the rights granted by the commission or by this Act.""
Section 14 of the Federal Water Power Act with minor amendments became Section 14, Part I, of the Federal Power Act. It is set out in the footnote.7  Section 14, containing the so-called ""recapture""8  provisions, Part I, relating only to licensees, refers to ""net investment"" as an element going to fix the recapture base of a hydroelectric property and provides that in any event the United States on recapture shall not pay more than the ""fair value"" of the property. Section 3(11) of the Federal Water Power Act, in effect reenacted as Section 3(13) of the Federal Power Act (albeit with amendments not pertinent here), provided originally and provides now that ""`net investment' in a project means the actual legitimate original cost thereof as defined and interpreted in the `classification of investment in road and equipment of steam roads, issue of 1914, Interstate Commerce Commission', plus similar costs of additions thereto and betterments thereof, minus the sum of the following items properly allocated thereto, if and to the extent that such items have been accumulated during the period of the license from earnings in excess of a fair return on such investment: (a) Unappropriated surplus, (b) aggregate credit balances of current depreciation accounts, and (c) aggregate appropriations of surplus or income held in amortization, sinking fund, or similar reserves, or expended for additions or betterments or used for the purposes for such reserves were created. * * *"" It is the contention of Safe Harbor, as will more particularly appear hereinafter, that since Section 20 refers to ""net investment"", the net investment of Safe Harbor must be determined in accordance with the formula of Section 3(13) set out immediately above. This, says Safe Harbor, the Federal Commission failed to do.
The foregoing gives us only part of the background of our problem. As we have stated Safe Harbor is a ""licensee"" under the Federal Water Power Act, now Part I of the Federal Power Act. But is it also a ""public utility"" under Part II? A ""public utility"" is defined in Section 201(e), Part II, as ""* * * any person who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this Part"". Section 201(b) in pertinent part describes such facilities as those employed for ""the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce * * *."" The Federal Commission has found on evidence which admits of no serious dispute, that Safe Harbor owns and operates the prescribed jurisdictional facilities. See 5 F. P.C. at pp. 226-229. See Jersey Central Federal Power & Light Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 319 U.S. 61, 63 S. Ct. 953, 87 L. Ed. 1258. Section 201(c) provides that ""electric energy shall be held to be transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a State and consumed at any point outside thereof * * *."" Section 201(d) states that the term ""sale of electric energy at wholesale"" shall mean ""a sale of electric energy to any person for resale."" It cannot be disputed that Safe Harbor makes such jurisdictional sales and the Commission has so found on very adequate evidence.9 
Safe Harbor then is not only a licensee under Part I but it is also a public utility under Part II of the Federal Power Act. Section 201(a), Part II, declares the congressional policy in respect to public utilities as follows: ""* * * the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest, and * * * Federal regulation of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this Part and the Part next following and of that part of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy, in interstate commerce * * * is necessary in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States.""
Section 205(a) provides that ""All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.""
Section 206(a) states, ""Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting such rate, charge, or classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order.""
Section 208(a) provides that ""The Commission may investigate and ascertain the actual legitimate cost of the property of every public utility, the depreciation therein, and, when found necessary for rate-making purposes, other facts which bear on the determination of such cost or depreciation, and the fair value of such property.""
The argument favoring repeal by implication,10  or, perhaps more accurately, the reasoning supporting the existence of such inconsistency between the regulatory provisions of Section 20, Part I, and Part II as to require the discarding of the former for the latter, runs as follows. Since Safe Harbor is a ""public utility"" it is regulable under Part II though it is also a ""licensee"" under Part I. The language of Part II, Sections 205, 206 and 208 therefore must be deemed to provide the sole regulatory formula. But the contra argument is said to require the conclusion that if a hydroelectric project is a ""licensee"" under Part I, as is Safe Harbor, it must be regulable under Section 20. If Section 20 be used it is asserted the unique ""net investment"" formula of Section 3(13) implemented by Section 14, the ""recapture"" section of Part I, must also be employed.
It is contended by Safe Harbor that this is so because the base for rate making or recapture is a single financial arrangement with the licensee. ""Net investment"", says Safe Harbor, must be the same element whether employed as a base to determine the rate of return or the amount to be paid on recapture. This was orally argued by counsel for Safe Harbor in the following terms: ""Congress determined that these two subjects of rate making and recapture were inseparably part of a single financial agreement with the licensee; and the reason for that is a very simple one — that the higher the rates, [sic] if the licensee gets excessive rates under the recapture formula of Section 14, it serves to reduce the recapture price, so that the two are naturally connected.""
Going on with Safe Harbor's argument, it contends that since Section 206, Part II, contains no such formula as that set out in Section 3(13), regulation under Section 206 must be on a different basis from that required by Section 20. Therefore Section 20 must prevail. The proponents of repeal by implication or fatal inconsistence assert that the provisions of the respective sections are incompatible and that one must give way to the other.
Sections 205, 206 and 208 are in fact a later statutory enactment than Section 20 but we do not find the argument in favor of repeal by implication persuasive. As we have seen, Sections 20 and 28 were simply constituted a part of the Federal Power Act by Section 212 of the Public Utility Act of 1935 and Section 213 of the latter Act states, ""The Federal Water Power Act, as amended, is further amended by adding thereto the following parts * * *""; then follow Parts II and III of the Federal Power Act. But Section 3(11), now Section 3(13) of the Federal Power Act, and Section 14 of the Federal Water Power Act were reenacted by the Public Utility Act of 1935 albeit amended in parts not pertinent here. See note 10, supra. It can be argued with some plausibility therefore that since Safe Harbor is a ""licensee"" it must be regulated as such even though it is also a ""public utility"". But under the view which we take it is not necessary to resolve these questions for we are of the opinion that the provisions of Section 20, Part I, and those of Sections 205, 206 and 208, Part II, are not conflicting or inconsistent.
Our reasons are as follows: First, we point out that the regulatory language contained in Section 20 is substantially identical in effect, the provisions of Section 3(13) aside, with that of Section 206.11  Second, Section 20 expressly provides that in the valuation of the property of any licensee for purposes of rate making ""* * * no value shall be claimed by the licensee or allowed by the commission for any project * * * under license in excess of the value * * * prescribed in section 14 hereof for the purposes of purchase by the United States * * *"". In other words the reference to Section 14 and via Section 14 to the ""net investment"" provision of Section 3(13) provides a limit for valuation and cannot be construed as a grant of power to make a valuation. Third, it will be observed that if regulation of rates be had under Section 20 of Part I that such regulation conceivably may be by State commissions, whereas recapture must always be by the United States. The United States on exercising its recapture powers under Section 14 at the end of the license period will be required to pay the ""net investment"" of the licensee in the project taken but ""not to exceed the fair value of the property taken."" ""Net investment"" therefore may exceed ""fair value"". ""Net investment"" may be determined by State commissions but ""fair value"" must be determined by the United States and the two elements need not be the same though they should coincide. If State commissions, for example, should allow too high a ""net investment"", applying the Section 3(13) formula, the United States would not be bound by such a determination though the figures have been set throughout the entire operative period of the license. The United States on recapture would pay merely ""fair value"". Moreover, the argument of Safe Harbor, both on its brief and as made orally, the latter being quoted at an earlier point in this opinion, that the subjects of rate making and recapture are ""inseparably part of a single financial agreement with the licensee"" will not hold water. As we endeavor to point out under ""II"" of this opinion, dealing with rate base, ""net investment"" as conceived of by Safe Harbor under the Section 3(13) formula must inevitably result in a rate in excess of a ""fair return"". This is so because under the view taken by Safe Harbor depreciation is not deducted from rate base. We conclude, and we elucidate our reasons at a later point hereinafter, that if Congress intended such a result it would have made that intention manifest in unmistakable terms in the language of Section 20 and would not have used the ""in excess"" phrase relating to value as prescribed in Section 14. Section 28 does not require a different conclusion. That section does not confer upon the licensee a right to an excessive rate of return or sustain a charge that the Commission in the instant case has in effect changed the rules relating to ascertainment of rate base in the middle of the game. The present pertinent provisions of Section 20 have remained unchanged since 1920. Fourth and last, while Safe Harbor lays great emphasis upon the last clause of Section 201(a) which provides that federal regulation is ""* * * to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States."", this language is not pertinent in the instant controversy for it is designed to be applicable only to electric energy transmitted and sold in intrastate commerce. The control of rates referred to in the section is control by a single State and the language has no relation to possible joint control by two or more States under the compact clause of the Constitution.12 
We are of the opinion that the view which we have expressed is not in violation of the Fifth Amendment. It is our duty to reconcile the provisions of the Federal Power Act with those of the Constitution of the United States and we think that our solution works a reconciliation of Safe Harbor's franchise, the Federal Power Act and the Constitution.
We shall presently hold, as appears from heading ""I. B."" of this opinion, that the Federal Commission has properly found that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland have been unable to agree on cooperative regulation of Safe Harbor's rates. Conceding that regulation under Part I, whether conducted by the Federal Commission or State Commission, is identical in scope and that the Federal Commission cannot regulate electric energy which the States cannot regulate under the compact clause, clause 3 of Section 10 of Article I of the Constitution, nonetheless, since regulation under Section 20 sans the ""net investment"" base of Section 3(13) is or should be substantially identical with regulation by the Federal Commission under Section 206 because of the similarity of regulatory language of Sections 20 and 206, it seems only an academic question whether regulation be conducted by the Federal Commission to require that the sale and distribution or use of electric energy ""* * * shall be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and just to the customer""13  (Section 20) or by the Federal Commission in such way that the rate or charge for electric energy may be regulated if it is ""* * * unjust, unreasonable [or] unduly discriminatory"". If, as we have held, the provisions of Section 206 properly are to be read in the light of Section 20 in fact making the provisions of Section 20 (sans the ""net investment"" language of Section 3(13)), the equivalent of those of Section 206, the rights of Safe Harbor as a licensee are preserved, the requirements of Section 28 are met and regulation of Safe Harbor's rates may proceed upon such a fair and equitable basis as the Federal Commission may determine. See Federal Power Comm. v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 64 S. Ct. 281, 88 L. Ed. 333. In other words we read Section 206 as if the provisions of Section 20 were a part of it.
We appreciate the fact that our construction of the provisions of Section 20 is at variance with the dicta of two courts. See Niagara Falls Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 787, 792-793, certiorari denied 320 U.S. 792, 64 S. Ct. 206, 88 L. Ed. 477, and Alabama Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 75 U.S.App. D.C. 315, 128 F.2d 280, 293, certiorari denied 317 U.S. 652, 63 S. Ct. 48, 87 L. Ed. 525. Our first opinion squints in the same direction. But as Judge Learned Hand stated in the Niagara Falls Power Company case, 137 F.2d at page 795, in construing the Federal Power Act, ""* * * it is necessary * * * to break through the band of verbal logic at its weakest spot. * * *"" Cf. Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 3 Cir., 169 F.2d 719, 723. The ""fair value of the property"" provision of Section 14, however, will supply an upward limit and whatever may be found to be the Section 3(13) ""net investment"" base the property can be recaptured by the United States at its ""fair value"". We are faced with the practical task of construing Acts of Congress. We can perceive no grave dichotomy in using the provisions of Section 3(13) for recapture and not employing them in arriving at a rate base.
We point out that Safe Harbor's license casts but little light on the problem of rate regulation. An examination of the license and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission tend to support the Commission, or at least, serve to show that the Commission's general conception of its rate-making power has been consistent. Article 1 of the license provides that the project ""* * * shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this license, including the terms and conditions of the Act and of the rules and regulations of the Commission pursuant thereto and made a part of this license"". Article 26 provides that the licensee shall abide by such reasonable regulation of services and rates as are prescribed by state agencies or by the Federal Commission when it has jurisdiction. Article 23 contains language somewhat like that of Section 3(13), Part I, of the Federal Power Act but that article deals with amortization as required under Section 10(d) of the Federal Power Act. Regulation 17 (Section 2D) of the rules and regulations of the Commission makes it clear that the determination of net investment and rate of return for purposes of amortization shall not be construed as limiting rate-making proceedings. This regulation is specifically referred to in Article 23 of the license. We do not assert that amortization and depreciation are the same coin. But no other article is even remotely analogous here. Since the license contains no limitations on rate-making authorities not to be found in the Federal Power Act itself, we need not concern ourselves further with the provisions of the license.
B. Was the Federal Commission entitled to regulate Safe Harbor under Part I of the Federal Power Act? Because of our rulings under heading ""I. A."" of this opinion this question has become academic. We think we should resolve it, however, because the reviewing Court may take a view of the substantive law which differs from our own. Under heading ""I. A."" we held that regulation of rates under Section 20 was substantially the same as regulation under Section 206 and that regulation under Section 206, because Safe Harbor is a licensee under Section 4, must be exercised with due regard to the provisions of Section 20. In our earlier opinion we held that the Federal Commission was without jurisdiction to regulate Safe Harbor's rates as provided in its earlier order14  because it had failed to make a finding that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland were ""* * * unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the services to be rendered, or on the rates or charges of payment therefor * * *"". Our actual ruling went no further than this. See 124 F.2d at pages 805-809. Certiorari was denied on April 6, 1942, 316 U.S. 663, 62 S. Ct. 943, 86 L. Ed. 1740. For more than two years the Federal Commission took no steps and nothing was accomplished by either the Pennsylvania or the Maryland Commissions.
On May 23, 1944, the Public Service Commission of Maryland began an investigation of rates charged by the Maryland Company. Hearings commenced on June 6, 1944. While this investigation was going on, viz., on June 27, 1944, the People's Counsel acting for the Maryland Commission, Counsel for the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and certain other parties who need not be enumerated filed a petition with the Maryland Commission asserting that the wholesale rates paid by the Maryland Company to Safe Harbor were unreasonably high, and requested the Maryland Commission to ask the Federal Power Commission to determine the reasonableness of Safe Harbor's rates.
Subsequently, on August 12, 1944 these parties wrote to the Federal Power Commission requesting that the ""* * * Commission itself determine these rates and if practicable afford relief by interim orders."" The letter is set forth in pertinent part below.15  Thereafter on August 30, 1944, the Chairman of the Maryland Commission wrote to the Federal Commission and requested it to proceed to determine the rates to be charged by Safe Harbor. The letter in pertinent part is set forth below.16  The Maryland Commission, by its Chairman, stated in this letter that public demanded the regulatory procedure which would ""get results in the shortest possible time"" and that while the Commissions of both Maryland and Pennsylvania were ""ready to engage in cooperative regulation"" in accordance with the opinion of this court, the Maryland Commission understood that the Federal Commission was ""prepared to pursue the matter to a conclusion in much less time than probably would be required by state action"". On September 1, 1944, the day following the receipt of the Maryland Commission's letter, the Federal Commission issued its order instituting the investigation of Safe Harbor's wholesale rates. The Federal Commission based its action ""* * * upon consideration of the petition filed on August 31, 1944 by the Maryland Commission * * *"" and the ""joint petition""17  filed August 14, 1944, by the intervenors in the Maryland proceeding previously referred to but made no finding that the Maryland Commission and Pennsylvania Commission had been unable to agree on regulation.
Extensive hearings were held. These culminated in the present opinion of the Commission18  and its order of November 4, 1946, here under review. As we have stated there was no finding by the Federal Commission of jurisdiction over Safe Harbor at the time its order instituting the rate investigation was issued but such a finding was made by the Commission in its opinion. In its opinion in the instant case as we have stated the Commission found that it had jurisdiction to regulate Safe Harbor's wholesale rates both under Section 20, Part I, because the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland had been unable to agree on regulation, and under Part II because electric energy created by Safe Harbor was dispensed by the prescribed jurisdictional facilities in interstate wholesale rates. We agree that the Commission may regulate Safe Harbor's rates but on the theory expressed in ""I. A."", supra.
The Act, as the Commission points out in its opinion, must be given a reasonable construction and one which will carry out the purpose of Congress to assure adequate and effective regulation of wholesale rates for electric energy in interstate commerce. The Commission stated, 5 F.P.C. at pp. 232-233, that if such rates continue to be too high ""inaction by the States involved, after reasonable opportunity [to cooperate in regulation] may show that they are unable to agree as certainly as formal announcement of the fact"". The Commission in its earlier opinion of June 11, 1940, 2 F.P.C. 182, had found that the 7% rate of return assured to Safe Harbor under its contract with the Pennsylvania Company19  was unreasonable. This finding was of course contested by Safe Harbor. As appears at a later point in this opinion under heading ""III"", this court, like the Federal Commission, is also of the opinion that the rates charged by Safe Harbor are too high. We can perceive no reason why the Commission's finding that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland are unable to cooperate for the purposes of regulation as provided by Section 20 may not properly be bottomed on a long continued failure of States to cooperate.
But aside from the foregoing, failure to cooperate under the compact clause certainly requires no more formality than cooperation under that clause. Cf. 124 F.2d at page 808. The compact clause does not require the States to embark upon a course of good faith bargaining as is required of the parties to a labor dispute under the National Labor Relations Act. 29 U.S.C.A. § 151 et seq. Refusal of a State to cooperate with another State under Section 20 may be for a good reason or for no reason at all. While the Maryland Commission in some of the correspondence set out in the antecedent footnotes as given lip service to the conception that it and the Pennsylvania Commission might engage in cooperative regulation, the Maryland Commission's letter of August 30, 1944, makes it clear that it had and has no intention of proceeding to cooperate with the Pennsylvania Commission to endeavor to regulate Safe Harbor's rates. Not infrequently that which may be read between the lines of a letter is more potent in carrying conviction than the written words themselves, and in the light of all which transpired before the Federal Commission made the regulatory order presently under review we have no doubt that the Maryland Commission did not wish to cooperate with the Pennsylvania Commission in respect to Safe Harbor's rates. It should be noted, however, that the Pennsylvania Commission has consistently taken the position that it is ready to cooperate with the Maryland Commission.
In addition to the foregoing the Maryland Commission's brief filed in this court states that that consideration of the factors referred to in the brief, which in substance are those set out in the Commission's letters ""* * * impelled the decision by the Maryland Commission that it would be impossible for it to join in cooperative regulation with the Pennsylvania Commission"".20  While this statement quoted in full in note 20, supra, was, of course, not before the Federal Commission when it held on November 4, 1946 that Maryland and Pennsylvania were unable to agree on regulation under Section 20, and therefore perhaps the statement may not properly serve as a statement to the Commission of a jurisdictional fact, the statements in the brief fortify the conclusion which both the Federal Commission and this court have reached. Moreover, it will be observed that in the sentence italicized in note 20, supra, and referred to in the beginning of this paragraph, the past tense of the verb ""impel"" is used and seems to reflect the long continued state of mind of the Maryland Commission. It would be a futile thing to set aside the proceeding of the Federal Commission simply because that tribunal did not have before it the conclusive statements now in the brief of the Maryland Commission. To do so would be to invalidate the proceedings of the Federal Commission for the sake of date on the calendar.21 
In view of the foregoing we have no doubt that the Federal Commission may undertake the regulation of Safe Harbor's rates under Section 20, Part I, to the same extent that the Pennsylvania and Maryland Commissions could have done under the compact clause.
II. Rate Base.
We come then to the questions presented by the instant review which are considered seriatim in the letter headings set out under this portion of the opinion.
A. Has the Federal Commission properly applied the formula of Section 20, Part I of the Act as the provisions of that Section are made applicable by Part II, Sections 205, 206 and 208? The order of the Federal Commission reduces Safe Harbor's rates by about $630,000 a year setting the corporation's fair return at 5%. Safe Harbor as we have indicated insists that the formula of Section 20 must be read in the light of the provisions of Section 3 (13) relating to ""net investment"" and in conformity with those of Section 14, the recapture section of Part I. It must be borne in mind, however, that the Commission asserts that it is entitled to regulate Safe Harbor's rates under both Part I and Part II. In view of the fact that we are of the opinion that the provisions of Section 3(13) are not binding on the Commission in establishing a rate base and that the rate regulatory provisions of Section 206, substantially the same as those of Section 20, must be read into Section 20, the divergence in our view of the law from that of the Commission in this connection is too small to be a matter of substance.
We have already passed in this opinion on the legal application of the sections of the Federal Power Act which Safe Harbor and the Commission have contended are involved but we have not discussed as yet the contentions of the parties relating specifically to depreciation and rate base. Safe Harbor has insisted that ""net investment"" as set out in Section 3(13) must be applied in order to arrive at a rate base under Section 20, relying, as we have said, on that portion of Section 3(13) which provides as follows: ""`net investment' in a project means the actual legitimate original cost thereof as defined and interpreted in the `classification of investment in road and equipment of steam roads, issue of 1914, Interstate Commerce Commission', plus similar cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof, minus the sum of the following items properly allocated thereto, if and to the extent that such items have been accumulated during the period of the license from earnings in excess of a fair return on such investment: * * * (b) aggregate credit balances of current depreciation accounts * * *."" It is reasonably clear from the Commission's opinion that it has attempted to apply the provisions of Section 3(13) though it insists that the statute does not compel it to do so since it can, it says, regulate under Section 206. It is apparent that the Commission has applied correctly the provisions of Section 206, Part II, in arriving at the same rate base. See 5 F.P.C. at pp. 243-247, and also the findings of the Commission 1 to 15 inclusive, 5 F.P.C. 265-268, and findings 19 and 20, id. at p. 269. In other words, the Commission has worked with both hands endeavoring, we think, to apply the provisions of Section 20 in the light of Section 3(13) and also those of Section 206. We think we state the Commission's position correctly when we say that the Commission held in effect that any depreciation taken in a year when there was a fair return on the investment was in fact depreciation taken ""in excess of a fair return"".
An example, however oversimplified, may prove helpful. Assume that the ""actual legitimate investment"" of X Company was $1,000,000 in the first year of its operations, a year which we will designate as 1940. Presume further that $110,000 remained from X Company's income after all operating expenses and taxes were paid and that $50,000 represented the depreciation of assets on the company's books. For the purposes of our example let us take 6% or $60,000 as a ""fair return"" to X Company. $60,000 would then be a reasonable return on the company's $1,000,000 investment. The $50,000 depreciation, however would be held by the Commission under the view expressed in its present opinion (see 5 F.P.C. at pp. 265-268) to be in excess of a fair return and would be deductible in determining the ""net investment"" to be employed for ascertaining the rate base in the next fiscal year, 1941. In other words, in the fiscal year 1941 the ""net investment"" of X Company would be $950,000. If the depreciation remained at the same figure, $50,000 and $110,000 again remained from the Company's income after operating expenses and taxes had been paid in the year 1941, and assuming again that 6% represented a fair return, it would follow that $57,000, not $60,000, would be a reasonable return to X Company. At the end of a period which could be estimated, presuming that no additions to equipment were made by X Company, the rate base would dwindle to zero as the depreciation account mounted.22  This seems to be the theory under which the Commission sought to apply the provisions of Section 20 in conjunction with those of Section 3(13) in the instant case.
Safe Harbor, however, if we apply what we understand to be its contentions to the instant example, takes the position that if the ""actual legitimate investment"" were $1,000,000 and $50,000 represented depreciation at the end of 1940, $110,000 remaining of the Company's income after operating expenses and taxes were paid, the $50,000 depreciation should first be deducted from the $110,000 and that the difference between the two amounts, representing net income and depreciation, viz., $60,000, would represent the fair return on X Company's $1,000,000 net investment. Therefore, says Safe Harbor, nothing should be deducted from the $1,000,000; that is to say, X Company should go into the next fiscal year, 1941, with a ""net investment"" of $1,000,000.
Changing the example slightly let us suppose that the ""actual legitimate investment"" in X Company was still $1,000,000, that $110,000 again remained after operating expenses and taxes had been paid; and $50,000 continued to be the figure properly deducted from the $110,000 for depreciation. Assume further that for the year in question 5% rather than 6% was a fair return on the $1,000,000. This would mean that only $50,000 could be properly allocated to profits or return for that year instead of $60,000. The $10,000 of $110,000 which was left over after normal depreciation and fair return would represent a sort of surplus but one not legitimately available for X Company's profit account since X Company already had earned a ""fair return"". If this $10,000 were allocated to the Company's depreciation account, the figure would represent ""depreciation in excess of a fair return"" under Section 3(13). Even Safe Harbor admits that this $10,000 would be deducted from the rate base, but it insists that only such a surplus depreciation could be deducted under Section 3(13).
The foregoing examples set out we think the conflicting views of the Commission and of Safe Harbor in what each deems to be the proper application of the provisions of Section 3(13) under the circumstances of the instant case. It is not necessary to resolve the conflict, however, for in our opinion, as we have stated, the Commission is not required to apply the Section 3(13) formula in order to arrive at a rate base.
We come now to the actual figures involved in the instant case. The Commission properly has employed the year 1943 as a typical year and has made the following statement of Safe Harbor's rate base:
 ""Actual legitimate investment $30,141,176 Reserve for depreciation 1,575,674 ____________ Net investment 28,565,502 Working capital 220,000 ____________ Rate base, 1943 28,785,502."" 
It is Safe Harbor's position, as we understand it, that its ""net investment"" under Section 3(13), is the actual legitimate original cost of its project, viz., $30,141,176, as shown in the first column above, without any deduction therefrom. Safe Harbor relies on the dictum of Judge Learned Hand in Niagara Falls Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d at page 792, in which it was stated that ""net investment"" is ""the base upon which the rates are to be calculated if it [the hydroelectric project] ever engages in interstate or foreign commerce, § 20 * * *"", and on a substantially similar statement in Mr. Justice Miller's opinion, in the Alabama Power Co. case, 128 F.2d at page 293, which declared that ""The formula for valuation of properties of licensees, for rate making purposes, is contained in the provisions of sections of the 1920 Act, which were incorporated into Part I of the Federal Power Act of 1935."" Safe Harbor seeks to rely on the language of Section 3(13) which we have quoted.
Safe Harbor points out that in that portion of the Commission's opinion and order dealing with rate reduction, finding that a 5% return on the rate base is a fair one, the Commission determined, again using the year 1943 as typical, that a rate reduction of $627,551, computed as below, would necessarily result:
 ""Operating Revenues .............. $3,620,412 Operating Revenue Deductions: Operating Expenses ............ 633,162 Depreciation .................. 504,100 Taxes, except Federal Income .. 143,110 Federal Income Tax ............ 273,214 Total Revenue Deductions .... 1,553,586 Net Operating Income .......... 2,066,826 __________ Return on Net Investment — 5% ......................... 1,439,275 __________ Excess Revenue ................ $ 627,551"" 
Safe Harbor shows, to use its own phrase, that the item ""earnings""25  is computed in the foregoing calculation as the amount of the ""net operating income"", viz., $2,066,822, arrived at only after deducting the allowance for depreciation, viz., $504,100.26  Safe Harbor points out that the finding of ""excess earnings"" made by the Commission Finding (19), 5 F.P.C. at p. 269, is based on the present day correct conception of earnings, viz., that ""earnings"" are the amount remaining after deducting operating expenses, including taxes and depreciation and that there can be no return to the licensee until proper provision has been made out of revenues for depreciation. With this we agree. But Safe Harbor also contends that a basic inconsistency exists between the findings of the Commission in regard to ""excess earnings"", Finding (13) and its Findings (19) and (20) 5 F.P.C. at pp. 268-269, in that in the latter findings the Commission has determined the amount of ""excess earnings"" and ordered a reduction in rates which will eliminate them while in Finding (13) the Commission has declared that after such elimination the amount credited to the depreciation reserve, ""* * * will continue to be accumulated from earnings in excess of a fair rate"". As we understand the situation, however, one of the reasons for Finding (13) was that the Commission believed that it had to follow the Section 3(13) formula. Another reason why the Commission made Finding (13) lies in the fact that all of it save two sentences27  is a proper finding under Section 206. In other words Finding (13) seems to embrace the Commission's two theories of rate base finding; viz., rate base finding under its conception of rate base finding bottomed on Section 3(13) via Section 20 and also rate base finding under Section 206. The finding has a foot in both Parts I and II of the Act and for this reason is somewhat ambiguous. The same comment may be appropriately made in respect to Findings (10), (12) and (20).28  To reiterate, if the Commission had applied the provisions of Section 20, sans the interpolation of its construction of Section 3(13), Finding (13) would have been unassailable in all respects. The Commission attempted to apply and did clearly make use of the regulatory provisions of Section 206 which, as we have endeavored to show, contained no important variance in regulatory effect from those of Section 20 as we have construed it.
Our problem then becomes one of dissection. Can those portions of Findings (1) to (4) inclusive, and of Findings (10), (12), (13) and (20) which the Commission directed to an interpretation of the regulatory provisions of Section 20 because of the interpolation of Section 3 (13) be excised from its 20 findings, leaving an adequate basis to sustain the order of the Commission on the regulatory provisions of Section 206 read in the light of Section 20 sans the provisions of Section 3(13)? We conclude that the Commission's findings and opinion are such that this result may be effected with due regard for the rights of Safe Harbor. The application by the Commission of the provisions of Section 206 seem to us to be clearly separable and capable of standing by themselves.
B. Has the Commission correctly applied the regulatory provisions of Section 206 in the light of Section 20? The Commission, using the year 1943 as typical, a course which is fully justified by the record, arrived at a figure of $30,141,176 as the ""Actual legitimate investment"" of Safe Harbor. See the ""Rate Base Statement"", note 23, supra. There is no dispute as to this figure. The Commission then took the depreciation reserve as recorded in Safe Harbor's books as of December 31, 1943 in the amount of $1,691,629.44 and for the purpose of determining a proper rate base for the year 1943, used as accrued depreciation the average amount recorded in Safe Harbor's depreciation reserve for that year which was $1,575,674. Deducting the figure last mentioned, the Commission then found a ""net investment"" of Safe Harbor for the year 1943 in the amount of $28,785,502.
What the Commission did was to use the customary and normal practice or technique of deducting depreciation in the course of arriving at a rate base. Such a course must be deemed to be proper in view of the principle enunciated in Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., supra, for it is an eminently reasonable and sensible one. It is true that the Commission designated the sum of $28,565,502, (net after deducting $1,575,674, ""Reserve for depreciation"", from $30,141,176, ""Actual legitimate investment"") as ""Net investment"" and the sum of $28,565,502 possibly should not have been so designated. The dispute here, however, is really one of terms, not of substance, for the phrase ""net investment"" as used in Section 3(13), Part I, is a term of art under the definition imposed by Section 3 (13). The Commission used a magic name which seems at first glance to canalize its finding solely to Section 3(13). But the fact remains that the figure of $28,565,502 validly describes Safe Harbor's position when a correct depreciation figure is deducted from the company's capital investment and may properly be employed in arriving at a rate base pursuant to the provisions of Section 206. The figure of depreciation employed by the Commission, viz., $1,575,674, is a reasonable one and the Commission has taken it from the books of Safe Harbor with what we deem to be proper safeguards. We can perceive no sound basis for further dispute in respect to this use of the item. To the amount of $28,565,502 the Commission has added the sum of $220,000 as working capital, an amount which concededly is proper. A rate base for the year 1943 of $28,785,502, is thus created.
Turning again to what we have hereinbefore designated as the ""Operating Revenues Statement"" it appears that the operating revenues of Safe Harbor for the year 1943 amounted to $3,620,412 and that the total of operating revenue deductions was $1,553,586, leaving a ""net operating income"" of $2,066,826. 5% on ""Net investment"" (.05 times $28,785,502, the rate base) amounts to $1,439,275, creating ""Excess Revenue"" of $627,551. Before it can be said that the amount of $627,551 is in fact excess revenue it is necessary to discuss other contentions of Safe Harbor and of the Commission.
We should point out that Safe Harbor vigorously asserts that even if its rates be regulated under Section 206 it is entitled as a matter of law to an undepreciated rate base. As we have indicated we find this contention to be without merit. Nothing in Section 206 requires such a result, and Section 206 with the interpolation of the provisions of Section 20, less those of Section 3(13), does not necessitate such a conclusion. As we view the law, the Commission is entitled to depreciate Safe Harbor's capital investment and deduct depreciation in a proper amount so long as the rate of depreciation is a reasonable one justified by all the circumstances. Such a conclusion seems to us to rest upon the interpretation of the Supreme Court in the Hope Natural Gas Company case, which we think provides a persuasive analogy for the determination of this aspect of case at bar. We will deal with ""Depreciation"" at greater length under the following sub-heading.
C. Is the item designated ""Depreciation"" in the amount of $504,100 in the ""Operating Revenues Statement"" correct? The amount of $504,100 representing depreciation results because the Commission has required Safe Harbor to adopt the so-called ""Straight-Line"" method of depreciation beginning January 1, 1947 ""* * * for the purpose of computing its bills for energy or power * * *"". See the order under review. The Commission has found the straight-line depreciation method to be the proper and adequate method under Section 30229  of the Federal Power Act. In addition to the foregoing the Commission held that the ""Service lives used by Safe Harbor in accounting for depreciation for the year 1943 * * *"" as set forth in Exhibit 39 are reasonable and proper to be used in connection with the straight-line method of depreciation. See Findings (16) and (17), 5 F.P.C. at pp. 268-269. The Commission stated in its opinion, 5 F.P.C. at p. 257, ""Safe Harbor's depreciation reserve, however, is deficient by about $3,000,000 as compared with its reserve requirement calculated on a straight-line basis and using the service-life estimates which it has been using. This deficiency must ultimately be made up if the capital impairment is to be avoided. For this reason and because the service-life estimates used by Safe Harbor in 1943 are within the realm of reasonableness, we think their use is proper. Hereafter, the annual depreciation charge shall be computed according to the straight-line method on the basis of the service-life estimates used by Safe Harbor in 1943.""
It is not necessary to include herein an extended discussion of the ""Straight-Line"" method of depreciation as compared with the ""Compound-Interest"" method or the ""Sinking-Fund"" method. These methods are clearly described in the Commission's opinion, 5 F.P.C. at pp. 246-256. It is true that by its order of June 11, 1940 the Commission prescribed for Safe Harbor the use by it of the compound-interest method, stating in its opinion, 2 F.P.C. at p. 189, ""Considering all the circumstances in this case, it is believed that the 4¼% compound-interest depreciation method should be employed rather than the straight-line or sinking-fund method."" It appears that the service lives appearing on Exhibit 39 had been employed by Safe Harbor in accounting for depreciation in conjunction with the 4¼% compound-interest method of depreciation. This was required by the Commission's order of June 11, 1940. See 2 F.P.C. at pp. 186-187, 194.
Safe Harbor makes a vigorous attack on the findings of the Commission referred to. It asserts that the Commission's result increases the annual allowance for depreciation for the year 1944 from approximately $237,000 to $504,000 and contends that the Commission's ""* * * findings are wholly unsupported by any credible evidence whatever"", that as a matter of law it was necessary for the Commission to have had exhaustive studies of depreciation made by qualified engineers before it could issue valid orders either as to the extent of depreciation existing in Safe Harbor's property or the correct amount of annual depreciation expense in the future, citing inter alia Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. City and County of San Francisco, 265 U.S. 403, 44 S. Ct. 537, 68 L. Ed. 1075, and Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 292 U.S. 151, 54 S. Ct. 658, 78 L. Ed. 1182. Exhibit 39 estimates service lives for Safe Harbor's depreciable physical property and equipment. This was referred to in the Commission's opinion in 2 F.P.C. at pp. 188-189, and was imposed on Safe Harbor by the Commission's order of June 11, 1940, which this court set aside.
There is little to be added to what the Commission has stated in its opinion respecting observed depreciation evidence as a measure of accrued depreciation. The Commission, quite properly we think, rejected the theory of observed depreciation preferring to estimate depreciation as a ""using-up of service life"" and not as a ""sudden event which occurs in the final stages of service."" See 5 F.P.C. at p. 250. The Commission has employed a method of depreciation which will afford great certainty to rate base making whereas Safe Harbor prefers that method which will result in a much higher rate base over a long period of time. That the straight-line depreciation method now ordered by the Commission is desirable seems to us to be open to no serious question. See for example ""Prudent Investment"", Bauer, 53 Yale L.J. 495, 505 et seq. (1944), and ""Depreciation and Effective Rate Control"", by the same authority, 54 Yale L.J., 92 et seq. (1944).
We reject Safe Harbor's contention that Exhibit 39, introduced into evidence in the instant case, does not afford a factual basis for the conclusions of the Commission as to service lives. The determination of service lives is one which rests peculiarly within the expert administrative discretion of the Commission. See Section 302(a), Part III. Whether the estimates contained in Exhibit 39 be used in connection with the compound-interest method of depreciation or the straight-line method is immaterial. These estimates will stand as one of the bases for either method.
The position of Safe Harbor in respect to the service lives of its dam, forebay, ramp, tailrace and powerhouse is not clear to us, but Safe Harbor seems to contend that these properties are really nondepreciable. Against the present factual background we cannot say that the Commission erred in finding certain properties depreciable which Safe Harbor asserts should be depreciated over a much longer period or in effect not depreciated at all. We cannot say that the conclusion of the Commission that certain physical properties possess a life of one hundred years is either capricious or arbitrary. The most solid physical object will deteriorate in time and by reason of a wide variety of circumstances. Many of the physical and economic sources that may bring about depreciation are not observable or visible. What Safe Harbor has done in offering the study of two engineers respecting depreciation in its physical properties is to present an issue of fact which lies distinctly within the province of the Commission. We may not try such issues.
It must be conceded that the Commission's position in respect to the depreciation method to be applied has been altered by time and, we may presume, by greater knowledge. As we have indicated, it compelled Safe Harbor by its order of June 11, 1940 to make use of the compound-interest method of depreciation employing 4¼% and rejected the straight-line and sinking-fund methods. But an agency is not compelled to be consistent, though consistency is a jewel in any crown. It is clear that by compelling Safe Harbor to adopt, although in midstream, a different method of accounting the Commission has not deprived Safe Harbor, its stockholders or the public of any substantial right. The Commission has acted in what it deems to be the public interest and has advanced sound reasons for a change of policy. There is no basis for judicial interference here.
We conclude, therefore, that the item designated ""Depreciation"" in the ""Operating Revenues Statement"" represents a correct and a proper application of the statute. The other deductions in the ""Operating Revenues Statement"" do not require explanation or discussion since there can be no serious dispute as to their validity.
III. Rate of Return.
A. Has the Commission unduly minimized Safe Harbor's risks, given undue weight to its power contracts and to the backing of its parent companies, fallaciously disregarded the actual cost of Safe Harbor's bond money or failed to give proper weight to similar factors? We do not propose to discuss the contentions of Safe Harbor in these respects at length. Upon full consideration we cannot conclude that the Commission has unduly minimized Safe Harbor's financial risks. It would be difficult to conceive of a more secure hydroelectric project. Safe Harbor's contracts for power and its backing by the Pennsylvania and Maryland Companies are exemplary. It is true the Commission has decided that the actual cost of Safe Harbor's bond money, 5.25%, should not be employed because it has considered Safe Harbor to be tardy in refinancing at a lower figure. The Commission stated, ""There could be no doubt that Safe Harbor can refinance at a great saving in interest cost. We have no doubt that it could refund today at a cost not to exceed 3 percent."" See 5 F.P.C. at p. 260, an the star note cited to the text. The conclusion of the Commission seems fully justified. See Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Serv. Comm., 262 U.S. 679, 692-693, 43 S. Ct. 675, 67 L. Ed. 1176, and United Railways & Electric Co. of Baltimore v. West, 280 U.S. 234, 251, 50 S. Ct. 123, 74 L. Ed. 390. We can perceive no issue which can arise under the Fifth Amendment on this question. Nor can we agree that the Commission's order imposes upon investors the net cost of the retention of reserve assets, thereby compelling Safe Harbor to render service to consumers at less than cost. This argument is answered, we think, by what has been hereinbefore stated in respect to propriety of the rate base found by the Commission and by what will be said hereinafter respecting the fair return to Safe Harbor and hence to its investors. But if the rate base be a fair one and the rate of return found by the Commission be justified, ""The net cost of the retention of reserve assets"", to employ Safe Harbor's words, assuming this to be more than a mere bookkeeping figure, will not result in damage to Safe Harbor, to its investors or to its rate payers. It cannot become a detriment if the rate of return be a fair one. Safe Harbor will not be compelled to render service to its consumers at less than ""full cost"". The charges which Safe Harbor will be permitted to make to its consumers will be fair and reasonable both to them and to it. Other arguments made by Safe Harbor, assimilable to this heading, do not require discussion.
B. Is the rate of return of 5% found by the Commission a ""fair return""? This question is indeed the important one in the case and everything which we have previously stated is intended to lead to what we believe is the proper answer. Categorically stated that answer is ""Yes."" Safe Harbor's major argument to be dealt with under this heading is that the investment of Safe Harbor's securities and its ability to render adequate service to its consumers, to function properly as a hydroelectric project dispensing electric energy in interstate commerce, will be destroyed or seriously impaired by the order of the Commission. The Commission made a complete study of Safe Harbor's economic record as well as of its physical properties. Every pertinent issue has been fully discussed and considered by the Commission. The findings of the Commission find full support in the record and its conclusions of law, except possibly those based on Section 3(13), Part I, are in accord with the Federal Power Act. A major question presented for determination by the Commission was the ascertainment of a proper rate base for Safe Harbor. This problem is really one of valuation and of accounting. The other major question for the Commission was the determination of a ""fair return"" on that rate base. Both questions are peculiarly within the administrative capacity of the Commission. A persuasive analogy is presented, we think, by the decision of the Supreme Court in S. E. C. v. Central-Illinois Corp., 338 U.S. 96, 113-127, 69 S. Ct. 1377. In the cited case Mr. Justice Rutledge stated in substance that the finding of the Securities and Exchange Commission as to valuation based upon expert judgment, discretion, prediction supported by evidence and ""fact"" and made pursuant to rational statutory construction, were not subject to reexamination on judicial review under Section 11(e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 15 U.S.C.A. § 79k (e). Cf. Section 206(a) of the Federal Power Act. See Section 313(b), Part III, which provides that ""The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive."" There are differences between the Federal Power Act and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 but the principle enunciated by the Supreme Court in the cited case seems to delimit the powers of a court reviewing the determinations of an administrative agency within the field confided to it by Congress. The provisions of Section 313(b) of the Federal Power Act are explicit. The scope of our review therefore is circumscribed but we may state that were we reviewing the matter de novo we would reach the same conclusions as those expressed by the Commission.
We have held that the rate base ascertained by the Commission is a proper one in the light of all the circumstances and we have ruled in effect that the Commission in applying Section 206, Part II, arrived at an interpretation of the Federal Power Act which gave a correct statutory result for the reasons hereinbefore stated and which need not be repeated here. We went further and searched the factual basis employed by the Commission in arriving at the rate base and we have been able to find no serious disparity in the views expressed by the Commission and in our own. If the analogy presented by the Central-Illinois Corporation case, supra, be persuasive, and we think that it is, controversy as to Safe Harbor's rate base should be at an end.
As to rate of return, similar considerations must prevail. The amount of rate of return is preeminently a question for determination by the Commission and the rate of return prescribed by it for Safe Harbor would have to be clearly confiscatory or outside the purview of the statute to permit judicial interference with the determination. We are aware of course that the Commission in its 1940 decision fixed 6% as a fair rate of return, 2 F.P.C. at p. 194. It should be noted that that rate of return was fixed by the Commission after applying the formula of Section 3(13), Part I. This may have had its effect upon the present determination by the Commission but in any event no rate of return is nailed to the Commission's head.
Safe Harbor contends that the Commission's finding that 5% constitutes a fair and reasonable rate of return is unsupported by substantial evidence and is not in accordance with law. This position cannot be sustained. The evidence in the record on rate of return is extensive indeed and we shall not review it in this too lengthy opinion. The Commission has adhered to the doctrine enunciated in Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Company v. Public Serv. Comm., 262 U.S. at page 693, viz., 43 S. Ct. at page 679, ""The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties.""
The rate fixed by the Commission assures a fair return in our judgment but again the scope of our review is limited by analogy to the Central-Illinois Corporation case, supra. In conclusion on this aspect of the instant case it seems desirable to repeat the words employed by Mr. Justice Douglas in the Hope Natural Gas Co. case (Federal Power Comm. v. Hope Natural Gas Co.), 320 U.S. 591, at page 602, 64 S. Ct. 281, at page 288, 88 L. Ed. 333, ""If the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the Act is at an end. The fact that the method employed to reach that result may contain infirmities is not then important. Moreover, the Commission's order does not become suspect by reason of the fact that it is challenged. It is the product of expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity. And he who would upset the rate order under the Act carries the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences."" No such showing has been made by Safe Harbor in the instant case.
Other points raised by Safe Harbor and by the Commission do not require discussion.
The order of the Commission will be affirmed.
Judge O'CONNELL heard the argument and participated in the consideration of this case but died before it was decided.

The first order was filed by the Federal Commission on June 11, 1940 and was set aside by the order of this court. See 124 F.2d 800. The order in the instant case was filed November 4, 1946. The Commission denied rehearing by an order issued December 24, 1946 and in the order denying rehearing made certain changes in its opinion which need not be discussed

By Title II of the Public Utility Act of 1935, approved August 26, 1935, 49 Stat. 838, 16 U.S.C.A. §§ 791a-825r, the original Federal Water Power Act was made Part I of the ""Federal Power Act"" and Parts II and III added to that Act. Part II vests in the Commission jurisdiction over the interstate transmission of electric energy and public utility companies engaged therein. Part III relates to such public utility companies and also to licensees and carries the administrative and procedural provisions of the Federal Power Act

Emphasis added throughout this opinion except where otherwise noted

Section 14, Part I, provides:
""Upon not less than two years' notice in writing from the commission the United States shall have the right upon or after the expiration of any license to take over and thereafter to maintain and operate any project or projects as defined in section 3 hereof, and covered in whole or in part by the license, or the right to take over upon mutual agreement with the licensee all property owned and held by the licensee then valuable and serviceable in the development, transmission, or distribution of power and which is then dependent for its usefulness upon the continuance of the license, together with any lock or locks or other aids to navigation constructed at the expense of the licensee, upon the condition that before taking possession it shall pay the net investment of the licensee in the project or projects taken, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus such reasonable damages, if any, to property of the licensee valuable, serviceable, and dependent as above set forth but not taken, as may be caused by the severance therefrom of property taken, and shall assume all contracts entered into by the licensee with the approval of the commission. The net investment of the licensee in the project or projects so taken and the amount of such severance damages, if any, shall be determined by the Commission after notice and opportunity for hearing. Such net investment shall not include or be affected by the value of any lands, rights-of-way, or other property of the United States licensed by the Commission under this Act, by the license or by good will, going value, or prospective revenues; nor shall the values allowed for water rights, rights-of-way, lands, or interests in lands be in excess of the actual reasonable cost thereof at the time of acquisition by the licensee: Provided, That the right of the United States or any State or municipality to take over, maintain, and operate any project licensed under this Act at any time by condemnation proceedings upon payment of just compensation is hereby expressly reserved.""
 8
The word ""recapture"" is employed by the Commission and by the parties albeit the taking over by the United States of hydroelectric projects under Section 14 would be in fact a first taking.
 9
As we pointed out in our earlier opinion, 124 F.2d at page 802, Safe Harbor's output is delivered to an integrated interstate electric system under the terms of the so-called ""1931 contract"", two-thirds of the energy being sold to the Maryland Company and the remaining one-third going to the Pennsylvania Company. The Commission has correctly stated, ""The sales are sales for resale"", 5 F. P. C. at p. 235. They constitute in fact wholesale sales in interstate commerce
 10
We use the words ""repeal by implication"" as a ""shorthand"" phrase in this opinion for the sake of brevity. Section 212 of the Public Utility Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 847, specifically provides that ""Sections 1 to 29, inclusive, of the Federal Water Power Act, as amended, shall constitute Part I of that Act * *."" Section 213, provides that ""The Federal Water Power Act, as amended, is further amended by adding thereto the following parts * * *."" There follow Parts II and III being specifically designated in Section 320 as the ""Federal Power Act"". Sections 13, 20 and 28 of the Federal Water Power Act were left unchanged by the Public Utility Act of 1935 and were merely constituted part of Part I of the Federal Power Act by Section 212 of that Act, and Section 3 (11), now 3 (13) of the Federal Power Act, and Section 14 of the Federal Water Power Act were amended in respects not material here by the Public Utility Act of 1935. Perhaps, therefore, the term ""repeal by implication"" is not entirely appropriate. It would seem to be more accurate to state that certain portions of Parts I and II are inconsistent with each other unless, we, or some other court, find a rational reconciliation as we think we have done. If the provisions of the respective Acts cannot be reconciled then the former must be deemed to be repealed by the latter. Cf. our earlier opinion, 124 F.2d at pages 803-804. We held that Section 313(b) vesting the power to review decisions of the Federal Commission in the respective Courts of Appeals were so inconsistent with those of Section 20 which were deemed to provide for the review of such an order by a three-judge district court under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, Sections 41 (subdivision 28), 43-48, of former Title 28, as to require the conclusion that the later enactment repealed the earlier by necessary implication. We then, as now, were faced with the duty of reconciling apparently inconsistent provisions of the Federal Power Act. The question as to which tribunal shall review an order of the Commission is very largely a procedural distinction and, as the Commission points out procedural changes may be effected without consent of the ""licensee"". Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 3 Cir., 139 F.2d 445, certiorari denied 321 U.S. 798, 64 S. Ct. 938, 88 L. Ed. 1086
We are aware that high authority takes an opposing view and asserts that the provisions of Section 20, Part I, are irreconcilable with those of Sections 201, 205 and 206, Part II, and that Section 20 has been repealed by implication. See for example, Benton, ""Jurisdiction of F. P. C. and State Agencies"", 14 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 78 (1945).
 11
Section 20 provides that the sale and distribution or use of electric energy ""* * * shall be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and just to the customer * * *"", Section 206 provides that the rate or charge for electric energy if ""* * unjust, unreasonable, [or] unduly discriminatory * * *"" is subject to regulation by the Commission
 12
Cf. Public Utilities Comm. of Rhode Island v. Attleboro Steam and Electric Co., 273 U.S. 83, 47 S. Ct. 294, 71 L. Ed. 549, See Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., 252 U.S. 23, 40 S. Ct. 279, 64 L. Ed. 434, and Connecticut Light & Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 324 U.S. 515
 13
The word ""customer"" is not defined in Part I and though it may possess some connotation of a small local consumer who uses electricity in his home, giving the phrase its ordinary meaning it is certainly broad enough to include the Pennsylvania Company or the Maryland Company to which Safe Harbor's electric energy is dispensed
See the definition of the word ""customer"", Webster's New International Dictionary, 3rd Edition.

Order of June 11, 1940
 15
 ""Baltimore, Maryland August 12, 1944. ""Docket No. IT-5914 Hon. Basil Manly Acting Chairman — Federal Power Commission
Dear Commissioner Manly:
The undersigned are counsel for certain intervenors in an investigation now pending before the Maryland Public Service Commission of the rates for electric service charged by the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore. The purpose of this letter is to request your Commission to determine, at the earliest convenient date, the just and reasonable wholesale rates charged for electric energy which is sold to the Consolidated Company in interstate commerce by two hydro-electric companies whose plants are located in the State of Pennsylvania, namely, Pennsylvania Water and Power Company and Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation. * * *
The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, a municipal corporation of Maryland, is interested in the rates charged by the river companies in two respects and capacities. First, it is one of the largest single consumers of gas and electric energy supplied by the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore in connection with the lighting of its streets and public buildings. Second, it is deeply concerned with the rates charged to other ratepayers in Baltimore City by that company. Baltimore County has a similar concern with regard to its own consumption and that of its residents.
The investigation here has proceeded to a point where it has become apparent that the rates of the Consolidated Company cannot be effectively determined unless determinations are also made of the just and reasonable wholesale rates at which this Company purchases energy in interstate commerce from the two hydroelectric companies. It also appears that the wholesale rates of these two companies, which have never been regulated, are grossly excessive * * * we beg to call your attention to the fact that in case known as Docket IT 5494, decided June 11, 1940, the Federal Power Commission found the rates of Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation to be excessive. Yet, notwithstanding the considerable time which has elapsed since this finding was made, the ratepayers affected, including the undersigned, have obtained no relief.
On June 27, 1944, People's Counsel for the State of Maryland, an official appointed by the Governor and charged by statute with the duty of representing the interest of the public in cases involving the rates and practices of public utility corporations, formally petitioned the Maryland Public Service Commission to request your Commission to make the rate determination here requested. The undersigned joined in that application. While no order has been passed upon those petitions, we understand informally that joint hearings with regard to these rates are contemplated by the Maryland and Pennsylvania commissions. * * *
In view of the clearer jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission and its superior facilities for making these determinations, we respectfully request that the Federal Power Commission itself determine these rates and if practicable afford relief by interim orders.
 Respectfully, (signed) Thomas J. Tingley Assistant City Solicitor Attorney for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (signed) Michael Paul Smith Attorney for County Commissioners of Baltimore (signed) Charles C. G. Evans Attorney for Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc. (signed) John Henry Lewin Attorney for Rustless Iron & Steel Corporation"" ""State of Maryland Public Service Commission,

 ""Docket No. IT-5914 August 30th, 1944 Honorable Basil Manly, Acting Chairman, Federal Power Commission,
Dear Mr. Chairman:
As you know, this Commission is engaged in an investigation of the rates charged by Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore which receives large quantities of electric energy from Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation and Pennsylvania Water and Power Company.
In considering a motion by People's Counsel, that this Commission request the Federal Power Commission to determine the reasonable rates to be charged by these two companies for energy supplied to Maryland, we have first inquired into the preparedness of the two state commissions to exercise the regulation indicated by U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation v. Federal Power Commission.
While the state commissions are ready to engage in cooperative regulation and the opinion of the Circuit Court indicates state jurisdiction, the public interest demands the procedure which will get results in the shortest possible time and we understand that the Federal Power Commission is prepared to pursue the matter to a conclusion in much less time than probably would be required by state action.
Under the circumstances, this Commission has decided to grant the motion of People's Counsel and hereby requests that the Federal Power Commission proceed to determine the reasonable rates to be charged by Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation and by Pennsylvania Water and Power Company for energy sold to Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore. * * *
 Very truly yours, /s/ Steuart Purcell, Chairman.""
 17
The phrase ""joint petition"" was used by the Federal Commission in its order of September 1, 1944 to designate the letter set out in note 15, supra
 18
Commissioner Draper dissenting
 19
It will be borne in mind that the Pennsylvania Company sells the electric energy which it purchases to the Maryland Company and to others at wholesale
 20
See pp. 8-9 of the Maryland Commission's brief which state as follows:
""Negotiations with the Pennsylvania Commission looking toward a cooperative procedure were instituted by the Maryland Commission. But little of a tangible nature was accomplished. The interests of Maryland and Pennsylvania were in conflict. The Maryland Commission had no assurance that its role in determining reasonable rates for Safe Harbor would be controlling or even persuasive under such procedure. There were no precedents of cooperation on rate regulation between the two Commissions or elsewhere to afford a guide. Furthermore the Maryland Commission is small, and it felt that it could not carry on its other responsibilities and effectively participate in such an extended joint investigation as would be required. In addition, the Maryland Commission's General Counsel, after consultation with Judge Benton, then counsel to the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, raised grave doubts as to the legality of the procedure. In the meantime, People's Counsel and certain intervenors before the Maryland Commission, as above referred to, had directly petitioned the Federal Power Commission to institute an investigation. Consideration of these factors impelled the decision by the Maryland Commission that it would be impossible for it to join in cooperative regulation with the Pennsylvania Commission. Accordingly Maryland Commission requested action by the Federal Power Commission.""
 21
The Maryland Commission's brief was filed in this court on March 14, 1949
 22
If, however, still taking the example of X Company, we assume a fair return to be $60,000 for the fiscal year 1940 and depreciation at the same figure, viz., $50,000 and net income after deduction of operating expenses and taxes to be $100,000, we see that the funds are insufficient for a fair return and proper depreciation. In such a case the Commission would have to concede that depreciation accounts would be deducted from the rate base only ""to the extent"" that they are in excess of a fair return. Since in this example $60,000 is the fair return, only $40,000 would be deductible from the rate base. Safe Harbor, as we analyze its position, seems in fact to contend that depreciation should never be deducted from the rate base. This may be criticized as an oversimplification but it is the practical result of Safe Harbor's position
 23
We designate this statement for the sake of convenience as the ""Rate Base Statement""
 24
We will designate this statement for the sake of convenience as the ""Operating Revenues Statement""
 25
See p. 55 of Safe Harbor's brief in chief
 26
The figure of $504,100 is arrived at by the Commission by use of a ""straight line"" depreciation method. See 5 F. P. C. at pp. 545-557. The propriety of using a ""straight-line"" method of depreciation is discussed at a later point in this opinion and need not be presently gone into
 27
The two sentences read as follows:
""The recorded depreciation reserve has been accumulated from earnings in excess of a fair rate of return"", and ""Under the provisions of the order hereinafter prescribed, such depreciation reserve will continue to be accumulated from earnings in excess of a fair rate of return."" These sentences look to the Section 3 (13) formula which we believe the Commission has applied erroneously and which in our opinion it should not have sought to apply at all.
 28
Findings (16) and (17) relate to methods of depreciation and ""service lives"" and are not germane to the issue which we are now discussing.""
 29
Section 302 provides as follows:
""(a) The Commission may, after hearing, require licensees and public utilities to carry a proper and adequate depreciation account in accordance with such rules, regulations, and forms of account as the Commission may prescribe. The Commission may, from time to time, ascertain and determine, and by order fix, the proper and adequate rates of depreciation of the several classes of property of each licensee and public utility. Each licensee and public utility shall conform its depreciation accounts to the rates so ascertained, determined, and fixed. The licensees and public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall not charge to operating expenses any depreciation charges on classes of property other than those prescribed by the Commission, or charge with respect to any class of property a percentage of depreciation other than that prescribed therefor by the Commission. No such licensee or public utility shall in any case include in any form under its operating or other expenses any depreciation or other charge or expenditure included elsewhere as a depreciation charge or otherwise under its operating or other expenses. Nothing in this section shall limit the power of a State commission to determine in the exercise of its jurisdiction, with respect to any public utility, the percentage rate of depreciation to be allowed, as to any class of property of such public utility, or the composite depreciation rate, for the purpose of determining rates or charges.
""(b) The Commission, before prescribing any rules or requirements as to accounts, records, or memoranda, or as to depreciation rates, shall notify each State commission having jurisdiction with respect to any public utility involved, and shall give reasonable opportunity to each such commission to present its views, and shall receive and consider such views and recommendations.""

256,The Experience - Visit Cruachan,https://www.visitcruachan.co.uk/the-experience/,20175-20175,"Go inside the Hollow Mountain
The Experience
Experience the cavernous machine hall a kilometre inside the solid rock of Ben Cruachan on a guided tour of the power station
Join expert guides as they lead visitors into the mountain and share the story of the power station – from its initial construction to its current role generating on demand electricity for Scotland.
Or learn more via our hydro hub. 
Travelling by bus from the Visitor Centre, the scenery of Loch Awe is replaced by the dark solid granite of the mountain as the tour drives to the centre of the power station. From the bus, it continues on foot up to the viewing gallery, which overlooks the machine hall and its four mighty turbines.
Cruachan Visitor Centre allows children and adults to learn all about how electricity can be quickly generated using the power of water. From interactive educational exhibition to the excitement of guided tours inside the Hollow Mountain, it’s sure to inspire future engineers.

Explore Ben Cruachan Dam, reservoir and mountain
DOWNLOAD TRAIL MAP
Cruachan Dam and reservoir
Cruachan Dam is a marvel of modern engineering in a breathtaking location on the slopes of Ben Cruachan. A crucial part of the pumped-hydro power station, it offers stunning views across the reservoir and the surrounding Highlands.
The buttress-style dam is 316 metres long and 46 meters high at its tallest point. The reservoir contained behind the dam can store more than 10 million cubic metres of water. Its natural catchment area is increased to a 23 km2 radius through 19 km of tunnels and piped aqueducts diverting rainwater and streams.
For information on general public access to the dam, please view our policy here.
The dam and reservoir are not accessible by car or included in the power station tour, but there are several walking routes by which visitors can access them:
Easy route – From Loch Awe Village
From the Visitor Centre, turn right and drive to Loch Awe Village. After the 30 mph sign, take the first road on the left signposted St Conan’s Road where there is a small car park for the village. From here a three-mile-long road leads to the dam. The road has a good surface all the way and climbs gradually across the hillside.
Steep route – From the Visitor Centre
The path begins at the Falls of Cruachan Railway Station, 200 metres along the road from the Visitor Centre. Climb the steps to the railway station and go through the blue gate under the railway line. The path ascends steeply through woodland, crosses a stile over a deer fence and onto open hillside. Please note that this path is steep and ascends 400 metres (1,312 feet), making sturdy footwear essential.

Ben Cruachan
At 1,126 metres (3,694 feet), Ben Cruachan is classed as one of the finest Munros in the Southern Highlands and is popular with hillwalkers and climbers. Its pointed peak towers above its rocky satellites and offers spectacular views. A ridge walk to the neighbouring peak of Stob Diamh provides a circular route around the Cruachan reservoir which takes between seven and nine hours to complete and covers a distance of 8.5 miles.
The walk is classed as ‘hard’ and includes steep and rocky paths with a small section of easy scrambling.
The descent covers a grassy slope which can be boggy.
Hillwalking essentials, including sturdy boots, a map, compass, torch, whistle and warm, waterproof clothing are all a must for safety on Cruachan as the weather is unpredictable – even in the height of summer.
All visitors are welcome to visit the Hollow Mountain Cafe in the Visitor Centre for refreshments whether they are part of a tour group or not.

Product Details
Explore emerging energies while designing a waterwheel to compete with other teams in producing the most effective design.
High school engineering design challenge with enough materials to support 8 groups of students.
Carolina Kits 3D®—Lab activity that designs a solution for an engineering problem to support NGSS and 3-dimensional instruction.
In this series of activities, students apply their knowledge of energy and energy transformations to solve an engineering problem, “How can we improve the design of a hydroelectric power system to maximize output?” During the research activity, students observe a hand generator and discuss the energy transformations that occur; then they relate the demonstration to a hydroelectric power system. Student teams are challenged to design and build a device that uses the energy of falling water to turn an axle and lift a paper clip (as a model for generating electricity). Students refine their design, attempting to design the device that lifts the paper clip highest using 100 mL of water. Rubrics, assessment questions, and STEM-based extension activities also are included.
Time Requirement
Total, 270 minutes over multiple class periods. Teacher prep, 60 minutes. Research and demonstration, 60 minutes. Design challenge, 60 minutes. Assessment, 30 minutes. Presentations, 60 minutes.
Digital Resources
Includes 1-year access to digital resources that support 3-dimensional instruction for NGSS. Digital resources may include a teacher manual and student guide, pre-lab activities and setup videos, phenomenon videos, simulations, and post-lab analysis and assessments.

WHEN WAS HYDROPOWER INVENTED?
Humans have been harnessing water to perform work for thousands of years. The Greeks used water wheels for grinding wheat into flour more than 2,000 years ago, while the Egyptians used Archimedes water screws for irrigation during the third century B.C. The evolution of the modern hydropower turbine began in the mid-1700s when a French hydraulic and military engineer, Bernard Forest de Bélidor, wrote the groundbreaking Architecture Hydraulique.
In 1880, a dynamo driven by a water turbine was used to provide arc lighting —a technique where an electric spark in the air between two conductors produces a light—to a theatre and storefront in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1881, a dynamo connected to a turbine in a flour mill provided street lighting at Niagara Falls, New York. Both of these used direct current technology.
The breakthrough in alternating current, the method used today, allowed power to be transmitted longer distances and ushered in the first U.S. commercial installation: an alternating current hydropower plant at the Redlands Power Plant in California in 1893. The Redlands Power Plant utilized Pelton water wheels powered by water from the nearby Mill Creek and a three-phase generator that ensured consistent power delivery.
In the past century, a number of innovations have enabled hydropower to become an integral part of the renewable energy mix in the United States. Find out more about the last 100 years of hydropower with this timeline.

Hydroelectric power: Is it economical?
We already know that hydroelectricity is one of the most widely-used renewable natural resources in North America.  And while there are a number of factors that make it popular, including the fact that it is renewable, one of the main reasons is that hydro is also economical.
Think about it.  Because it relies only on the power of moving water—and not some type of fuel—there are no price fluctuations to consider.
And while it’s expensive to build the infrastructure, hydroelectric projects have long lifetimes (on average 50-100 years) and are relatively easy to maintain.
>According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, hydropower is considered to be relatively inexpensive to operate – with generation costing between 2 to 4 cents per kilowatt hour.
At the end of the day, the many millions of consumers who get their electricity from hydro benefit from low electricity costs, making it an economical source of energy.
In the world's conversation about energy, one point is beyond debate: Energy makes a vital contribution to people's quality of life, to society and to human progress. This is true today, and it will remain true in the future. That's why Energy Matters was created. We believe it's important to equip people with unbiased information so they may form opinions, join the conversation and feel confidence in the work and accomplishments of the energy sector. Energy Matters is an initiative that provides transparent information and perspective on energy. Here, we'll cover a range of topics: the scale of global energy; the ways energy is sourced and produced; current energy technology; forthcoming innovations; the world's future energy needs; and the sustainable sources of energy that will fill them. Because energy matters to everyone, we hope you'll rely on Energy Matters as an ongoing source of balanced information.

Notes
-  Significance: The Shoshone complex is significant for being one of the earliest hydroelectric plants on the Colorado River and one of the largest in the Rocky Mountain Region to depend upon the flow of a river for its source of power rather than on the stored water of a reservoir. It is also significant as a remarkable engineering accomplishment in terms of the physical difficulties of construction within Glenwood Canyon and the scale of the undertaking.

What is Pumped Storage Hydropower? 
Pumped storage hydropower (PSH) is a type of hydroelectric energy storage. It is a configuration of two water reservoirs at different elevations that can generate power as water moves down from one to the other (discharge), passing through a turbine. The system also requires power as it pumps water back into the upper reservoir (recharge). PSH acts similarly to a giant battery, because it can store power and then release it when needed. The Department of Energy's ""Pumped Storage Hydropower"" video explains how pumped storage works.
The first known use cases of PSH were found in Italy and Switzerland in the 1890s, and PSH was first used in the United States in 1930. Now, PSH facilities can be found all around the world! According to the 2023 edition of the Hydropower Market Report, PSH currently accounts for 96% of all utility-scale energy storage in the United States. America currently has 43 PSH plants and has the potential to add enough new PSH plants to more than double its current PSH capacity.

Pumped storage hydropower is the most dominant form of energy storage on the electric grid today. It also plays an important role in bringing more renewable resources onto the grid.
U.S. Department of Energy
Open-Loop Versus Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower
PSH can be characterized as open-loop or closed-loop. Open-loop PSH has an ongoing hydrologic connection to a natural body of water. With closed-loop PSH, reservoirs are not connected to an outside body of water.
Open-loop pumped storage hydropower systems connect a reservoir to a naturally flowing water feature via a tunnel, using a turbine/pump and generator/motor to move water and create electricity.
Closed-loop pumped storage hydropower systems connect two reservoirs without flowing water features via a tunnel, using a turbine/pump and generator/motor to move water and create electricity.
The Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO) invests in innovative PSH technologies and research to understand and determine the value of the potential benefits of existing and prospective advanced PSH facilities. Through the HydroWIRES Initiative, WPTO is currently working on projects designed to evaluate and expand hydropower and PSH’s contribution to grid resilience and reliability.

Notes
-  Significance: J. Roy Pennell acquired property and began construction of the multiple arch reinforced concrete dam in 1933. Pennell abandoned the project in 1935 and it was completed by the City of Abbeville with Public Works Administration funds in 1940. The two original S. Morgan Smith hydro turbines are still in operation. In 1946 the plant was enlarged and a Bush Sulzer diesel engine acquired to provide auxiliary power. The facility remains in operation today.

n July, UN Secretary Ban Ki-Moon highlighted the role of hydropower in boosting the use of renewable energy globally, when he visited a nonprofit institute in China that helps emerging nations develop and build hydropower plants. Many countries consider hydroelectricity a clean source of power because it doesn’t involve burning dirty fossil fuels. But that’s far from true. Hydropower is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions: a new study shows that the world’s hydroelectric dams are responsible for as much methane emissions as Canada.
The study from Washington State University finds that methane, which is at least 34 times more potent than another greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, makes up 80% of the emissions from water storage reservoirs created by dams. What’s more, none of these emissions are currently included in global greenhouse gas inventories. These are already revealing a worrisome future in which rising global temperatures will likely cause environmental changes such as rising sea levels and stronger hurricanes, which could uproot communities and intensify competition for food and other resources.
“I think this study shows that dams as a source of energy aren’t without their greenhouse gas costs,” says Bridget Deemer, a research ecologist at the US Geologic Survey, who led the study during her prior position as a research associate at Washington State. “Even though it’s a renewable source of energy, people should keep the greenhouse gas side of the picture in mind when making planning and policy decisions regarding dams.”
The research, which examines 100 recent studies on greenhouse gas emissions from 267 large reservoirs around the world, also calls into question the wisdom of building more hydroelectric dams as countries try to nix their dependence on coal, natural gas and oil. An estimated 3,700 new dams are proposed or under construction around the globe, the study reports. It suggests the hydropower industry will need to control its emissions.

But industry officials in the US say the study misrepresents the benefit of hydropower in the fight to rein in global warming.
“Singling out hydropower is irresponsible and inaccurate, to say the least,” says LeRoy Coleman, a spokesman for the National Hydropower Association, based in Washington DC. “Hydropower is needed to meet federal and state clean energy goals.”
Hydropower represents 6% of all energy generation in America, according to the US Energy Information Administration. For newly built power plants, hydropower’s total cost of construction and operation runs about $68 per megawat-hour, which is comparable to solar, slightly more expensive than wind, and cheaper than coal and natural gas when those sources incorporate technology to capture carbon emissions.
Hydropower is often considered a source of renewable electricity because its fuel, water, is constantly replenished by nature. By that standard, hydropower produces 52% of all renewable electricity in the US, according to the National Hydropower Association.
Only 3% of reservoirs in the US are equipped to produce hydropower, Coleman says. Others are limited to water storage and flood protection duties, and some of them are good candidates for electricity generation, he adds.
“The responsible and logical approach would be to capture the energy potential of these reservoirs and combat climate change by installing hydropower equipment,” Coleman says.

As recently as a decade ago, little was known about emissions from water storage reservoirs. But understanding has evolved rapidly. For instance, researchers initially thought shallow reservoirs in tropical regions were the largest emitters because their stored water was more prone to heating up, which could fuel greenhouse gas production.
But analysis by Deemer and her colleagues shows that the latitude and depth of water are not leading factors. Instead, “biological activities” in a reservoir – such as decaying vegetation and nutrient runoff from watersheds upstream – are more important indicators of greenhouse gas emissions. The nutrient runoff can be from natural processes or from farming, logging and land development.
Using data from the 267 reservoirs, the authors estimate total emissions from all reservoirs worldwide and conclude that those water storage facilities account for 1.3% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions.
Another new study published by the journal PLOS One reaches similar conclusions, although it finds carbon dioxide to be a bigger share of emissions than methane. After examining data from more than 1,400 dams worldwide, it identifies the rate of soil erosion into a reservoir as a leading predictor of carbon dioxide emissions.
Led by Laura Scherer, a research associate at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, that study concludes the “carbon footprint of hydropower is far higher than previously assumed”.
“These are massive emissions, and we can’t ignore that,” says Kate Horner, executive director of the environmental group International Rivers, based in Berkeley, California. “There are a massive number of dams that are currently proposed to be built. It would be a grave mistake to continue to finance those with the impression that they were part of the solution to the climate crisis.”
Coleman contends that it’s premature to use data from these studies to criticize hydropower because the science remains uncertain.
It is challenging to measure reservoir emissions because so many factors can play a role, Deemer acknowledges. The scientific community also doesn’t follow a standard practice for counting emissions, even though the International Hydropower Association and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) published a set of guidelines in 2010.

Emissions vary according to a wide variety of factors, including water and air temperatures, season and time of day, vegetation and soil types in both the reservoir and the upstream watershed, and watershed management practices.
Hydropower dams constantly manipulate water levels to make electricity, a process that also affects the amount of emissions that make their way into the atmosphere from the reservoir. As water levels decline, the hydrostatic pressure on submerged soils also lowers and allows gas bubbles to escape. Sometimes the methane in these bubbles is absorbed by the water column and never reaches the surface. Other times it makes the great escape into the air.
Deemer and her colleagues note that many studies don’t sample emissions thoroughly enough both across reservoir surface area and over time. As a result, she says, the emissions estimates in her study are probably low.
The challenge in measuring emissions also makes it difficult to figure out how to reduce them. Researchers speculate it may be possible to reduce emissions by managing water levels in a reservoir differently. This, however, could affect electricity generation, fishery and flood protection, and other operations.
Protecting watersheds to reduce erosion into reservoirs could also reduce emissions as well as improve water quality, forest health and aquatic habitat.
Global greenhouse gas inventories currently do not include emissions from reservoirs at all, but that is changing.
At an October meeting in Bangkok, a committee of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change took a first step by agreeing to include reservoirs, which it categorizes as “flooded lands”, in an updated guidance document that instructs nations on accounting for their greenhouse gas emissions. But it may be several more years until that document is formally approved.
The US government does not account for reservoir emissions in its own greenhouse gas inventory. The country is dotted with roughly 79,000 dams, including more than 2,200 private and public hydropower plants. The US Bureau of Reclamation, for example, manages 337 reservoirs, and a science advisor to the agency, Dave Raff, says the bureau is taking on the emissions accounting task.
“We’re engaged in trying to understand what the different mechanisms are for reservoirs as they generate these greenhouse gases,” Raff says. “And ultimately, what are the management levers we have to pull that could mitigate those. I do think we feel a sense of urgency to be on that path.”
The article was amended on 6 November 2016 to show that the cost of building and operating a hydropower plant is about $68 per megawtt-hour, not kilowatt-hour.

Overview
Key Points
Climate change is likely to both increase electricity demand for cooling in the summer and decrease electricity, natural gas, heating oil, and wood demand for heating in the winter. New infrastructure investments may be necessary to meet increased energy demand, especially peak demand during heat waves.
Climate change could affect the amount of water available to produce electricity or extract fuel. In areas where water is already scarce, competition for water between energy production and other uses could increase.
Sea level rise and more frequent intense storms could disrupt energy production and delivery by damaging electricity infrastructure, fuel delivery infrastructure and equipment, power plants, or storage facilities.
Changes in temperature, precipitation, sea level, and the frequency and severity of extreme events will affect how much energy is produced, delivered, and consumed in the United States.
Energy plays an important role in many aspects of our lives. For example, we use electricity for lighting and cooling. We use fuel for transportation, heating, and cooking. Our energy production and use is interconnected with many other aspects of modern life, such as water consumption, use of goods and services, transportation, economic growth, land use, and population growth. Our production and use of energy (most of which comes from fossil fuels) also contributes to climate change, accounting for more than 84% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.[1]

Temperature, Energy Demand, and Energy Supply
Increases in temperature will likely increase our energy demand, as well as change our ability to produce electricity and deliver it reliably.
In a warmer climate, Americans will use more electricity for air conditioning and less natural gas, oil, and wood for heating. If the nation's climate warms by 1.8°F, the demand for energy used for cooling is expected to increase by about 5-20%, while the demand for energy used for heating is expected to decrease by about 3-15%.[2] Net expenditure in annual heating and cooling could increase by 10% ($26 billion in 1990 dollars) with a 4.5°F warming by the end of the century, and by 22% ($57 billion in 1990 dollars) with a warming of 9.0°F.[3] Heating demand would decrease the most in the northern United States, and cooling demand would increase the most in the southern United States. Since demand for electricity for cooling is expected to increase as a result of temperature increase and extreme heat events, the balance in energy delivery is likely to shift from natural gas and fuel oil used for heating to electricity used for air conditioning.[3] Changes in energy demand will likely affect greenhouse gas emissions, but the net effect depends on which energy sources, including alternative energy, are used for electricity and heating.

Warming is likely to increase summer peak electricity demand in most regions of the United States.[3] Meeting increases in this peak demand could require investments in new energy generation and distribution infrastructure, and new mechanisms will need to manage system reliability and peak demand, which can be more expensive than average demand levels.[3] For example, based on a 6.3 to 9°F temperature increase, climate change could increase the need for additional electric generating capacity by roughly 10-20% by 2050. This would require hundreds of billions of dollars in additional investment.[2]
A warmer climate may reduce the efficiency of power production for many existing fossil fuel and nuclear power plants because these plants use water for cooling. The colder the water, the more efficient the generator. Thus, higher air and water temperatures could reduce the efficiency with which these plants convert fuel into electricity.[3]
Energy demand is expected to shift by the end of the century. The number of cooling (or heating) ""degree days"" refers to the sum of the number of degrees that each day's average temperature is hotter (or colder) than 65°F over the course of a year.  As the figure shows, the increase in the number of cooling degree days is expected to be larger than the decrease in number of heating degree days, comparing the historic average and the projected average over the final two decades of this century.

Water Availability and Energy

Energy and water systems are connected. Energy is needed to pump, transport, and treat drinking water and wastewater. Cooling water is needed to run many of today's power plants. Hydroelectricity (electricity produced by running water) is itself an important source of power in parts of the United States.
Changes in precipitation, increased risk of drought, reduced snowpack, and changes in the timing of snowmelt in spring will influence our patterns of energy and water use. For example:
Power plants can require large amounts of water for cooling. On average, a kilowatt-hour of electricity (enough power to run 400 typical compact-fluorescent light bulbs for an hour) requires 25 gallons of water to be withdrawn from rivers or lakes.[2] Parts of the Southeast and Southwest face increased competition for water to meet the demands of population and economic growth while also protecting natural ecosystems. Many local governments in these regions have slowed or stopped plans for new power plants that require large withdrawals of water due to concerns about adequate availability of cooling water.[6]
More frequent and severe heat waves will likely increase the demand for electricity in the Southeast and Southwest. At the same time, these areas are likely to experience reduced water supplies due to increased temperature and evaporation, as well as possible decreased rainfall. Since water is necessary for electricity production, these combined effects could stress water resources. For more information about climate change impacts in the Southeast and Southwest, please visit the Southeast Impacts and Southwest Impacts pages.
Hydroelectric power plants are sensitive to the volume and timing of stream flows. In some regions, especially during times of increased rainfall, dam operators may have to allow some water to bypass the electric turbines to prevent downstream flooding.[2] Maintaining stream flow for hydroelectric dams could present conflicts with other activities, such as salmon habitat restoration in the Pacific Northwest.[4]
Growing crops for biomass and biofuel energy could stress water resources in certain regions, depending on the type of crop, where it is grown, agricultural production in the region, and current water and nutrient management practices.[5] Given the many factors involved, more research is needed to understand how climate change may affect these resources.[3]
Rising temperatures, increased evaporation, and drought may increase the need for energy-intensive methods of providing drinking and irrigation water. For example, desalinization plants can convert salt water into freshwater, but consume a lot of energy. Climate change may also require irrigation water to be pumped over longer distances, particularly in dry regions across the western United States.[3]

Sea Level Rise, Storm Surge, and Extreme Events

A large portion of U.S. energy infrastructure is located in coastal areas and therefore sensitive to sea level rise and storm surge. For example, fuel ports and the generation and transmission lines that bring electricity to major urban coastal centers are at risk. Changes in the frequency and severity of storms and other extreme events may also damage energy infrastructure, resulting in energy shortages that harm the economy and disrupt peoples’ daily lives. 
A substantial portion of U.S. energy facilities are located on the Gulf Coast or offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Several coastal power plants in the United States are less than three feet above sea level, and facilities that import or export coal, gas, and oil are also located in coastal regions.[3] Sea level rise and more intense storms and hurricanes in coastal areas could increase the risk of energy supply disruptions.

Several thousand oil drilling platforms offshore of the Gulf Coast are vulnerable to extreme weather events. For example, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita damaged more than 100 platforms and damaged 558 pipelines in 2005, impacting markets as far away as New York and New England.[6]
Flooding and intense storms can damage power lines and electricity distribution equipment. These events may also delay repair and maintenance work. Electricity outages can have serious impacts on other energy systems as well. For example, oil and gas pipeline disruptions following extreme weather events are often caused by power outages rather than physical damage to the infrastructure.[2]
Railways and marine transportation that move large amounts of oil and coal in the United States are also vulnerable to climate change. More intense rainfall and storms can threaten railways by washing out railway beds. Changes in precipitation could affect marine transportation by reducing the navigability of rivers.

Renewable Biofuels
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the first Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), mandating that biofuels be integrated into transportation fuel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The Energy Independence Security Act (EISA) of 2007 increased the required amount of renewable fuel to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022.
Annually, the EPA sets volume requirements for each category of renewable fuel. The volumes are determined by technology and the availability of each type of renewable fuel.
Every three years, the EPA is required to send a report to Congress that evaluates the environmental and resource conservation impacts of increased biofuel production and use.
For more information about the RFS, visit EPA's RFS page. For specific information about the environmental assessment, read the First Triennial Report to Congress.
Wind Speed, Cloud Cover, and Renewable Energy
The impacts of climate change on wind and solar power is still a developing area of research due to the challenges involved in modeling wind and cloud cover changes at the necessary spatial scales.

This Unique Combo Of Wind And Hydro Power Could Revolutionize Renewable Energy
Tobey Grumet
October 16, 2016
Wind is a clean, cheap source of renewable energy, but it’s also fickle. You can never be sure whether the wind will blow. But engineers in Europe have now found a way to crack this shortcoming by combining it with hydropower. The big idea here is that the wind will generate electricity when it’s, well, windy, and the water will act as a giant battery that will discharge and modulate output when it stops blowing.
The German firm Max Boegl Wind AG approached GE Renewable Energy to collaborate on the first wind farm with an integrated hydropower plant in March. The four-turbine pilot project will be connected to the grid by the end of 2017, and the hydropower plant should be operational by the end of 2018.

These won’t be ordinary wind turbines. They will be the world’s tallest, standing 584 feet high when the blade is pointing straight up. The base of the turbines—the bottom 131 feet—will double as a water reservoir holding 1.6 million gallons of water, and the whole turbine will sit in another reservoir holding an additional 9 million gallons.

The turbines will stand 584 feet high when the blade is pointing straight up. The bottom will serve as a water reservoir. Illustration credits: Max Boegl Wind AG

The setup essentially works as a hydro pump station (see image above). When electricity is needed, water flowing downhill from the reservoirs will power the hydro plant. When the energy supply is high, the hydro plant will pump the water back up the hill to the reservoirs and will act as the giant battery. The hydro plant will benefit from this arbitrage, making power when the price is high and using power when the price is low, while complementing the wind farm. The combination of the two power sources (which will work in parallel to each other) will ensure that electricity is always flowing from the plant.

For it to work, the wind turbines must sit at the top of a hill, and there must be room in the valley for a man-made lake — in this case 600 feet below the wind farm—that will store the water when it’s not being used by the turbines.

The Swabian-Franconian Forest, in Germany, proved the perfect location. Built into the hills will be a hydroelectric plant capable of producing 16 megawatts of power, while the wind farm on its own will produce 13.6 megawatts.

The team behind the farms says the innovative design provides a very fast increase in output, allowing the hydro plant to react immediately to fluctuations in the German energy market. “Germans in this area are known as tinkerers and inventors,” says Cliff Harris, general manager for onshore wind in EMEA at GE Renewable Energy. “So the mentality of this technology really fits with the population.”

The four wind turbine sites will be connected by a channel that takes the water down to the valley. Image credit: Max Boegl Wind

GE is supplying the wind turbines as well as the software, which will make the wind plant more efficient. Software such as the Digital Wind Farm suite already runs on the company’s Predix system, a cloud-based platform for the Industrial Internet. The system collects data from different sources, including the wind turbines, the grid and even weather forecast services and analyzes it in the cloud. The insights help operators predict maintenance needs, optimize production throughout the day and control how much power can flow into the grid at any given time. This is important because too much power could result in a dangerous a surge, and too little power would turn off the lights.

The German project is the first of its kind and, if it proves successful, could pave the way for future wind-hydro combinations. Boegl expects to do one or two projects per year in Germany after 2018. (The reservoirs can also saltwater, which means the plants can be built close to the sea.)

Because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine, all forms of renewable energy need some kind of backup source to ensure reliability. By using hydropower, the combined plant keeps power flowing without turning to fossil fuels. This innovative plant will also help Germany move toward its goal of generating at least 45 percent of its energy from renewables by 2030.

“It’s a bit risky, and it can’t work everywhere,” says Harris of the new combo plant. “But the plant will run for several decades, and we expect the benefits will be felt over that time.”

The goal of the Hydropower Vision is to operate, optimize, and develop hydropower in a manner that maximizes opportunities for low-cost, low-carbon renewable energy production, economic stimulation, and environmental stewardship to provide long-term benefits for the nation.
HYDROPOWER VISION FRAMEWORK
The Hydropower Vision Report includes a Roadmap that defines a range of actions needed to realize the economic and social benefits of increased hydropower in the future. It is based on three foundational “pillars,” that are critical to ensuring the integrity of the research, modeling, and analysis in the Hydropower Vision:
Optimization: Optimize the value and power generation contribution of the existing hydropower fleet within the nation’s energy mix to benefit national and regional economies, maintain critical national infrastructure, and improve energy security.
Growth: Explore the feasibility of credible long-term deployment scenarios for responsible growth of hydropower capacity and energy production.
Sustainability: Ensure that hydropower’s contributions toward meeting the nation’s energy needs are consistent with the objectives of environmental stewardship and water use management.
HYDROPOWER VISION INSIGHTS
Applying these foundational principles to both the quantitative and qualitative analyses in the Hydropower Vision led to several key insights regarding the role of existing and future hydropower in the U.S. power sector:
Existing hydropower facilities have high value within the U.S. energy sector, providing low-cost, low-carbon, renewable energy as well as flexible grid support services.
Hydropower has significant near-term potential to increase its contribution to the nation’s clean generation portfolio via economically and environmentally sustainable growth through optimized use of existing infrastructure.
Meeting the long-term potential for growth at potential sites that are not developed for hydropower is contingent upon continued commitment to innovative technologies and strategies to increase economic competitiveness while meeting the need for environmental sustainability.
Significant potential exists for new pumped storage hydropower to meet grid flexibility needs and support increased integration of variable generation resources, such as wind and solar.
The economic and societal benefits of both existing and potential new hydropower, as quantified in this report, are substantial and include job creation, cost savings in avoided mortality and economic damages from air pollutants, and avoided GHG emissions.
The Hydropower Vision analysis finds that with continued technology advancements, innovative market mechanisms, and a focus on environmental sustainability, U.S. hydropower could grow from its current 101 gigawatts (GW) to nearly 150 GW of combined electricity generating and storage capacity by 2050.

Hydropower Vision: New Report Highlights Future Pathways for U.S. Hydropower

Energy.gov Hydropower Vision: New Report Highlights Future Pathways for U.S. Hydropower
Hydropower has been around for more than a century, and is currently the nation's largest source of clean, domestic, renewable electricity. What could its role look like in the year 2050?
Providing about 7 percent of the nation’s electricity, hydropower supports more than 143,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing, construction and utility operations and maintenance -- all while improving the environment and strengthening our economy. Additionally, pumped-storage hydropower represents 97 percent of all energy storage in the United States, offering the flexibility and reliability the electricity grid needs to deliver affordable clean energy to American homes and businesses.
So what does the future of hydropower look like? To answer that question, over the past two years the Energy Department has collaborated with more than 300 experts from more than 150 hydropower industry companies, environmental organizations, state and federal governmental agencies, academic institutions, electric power system operators, research institutions and other stakeholders to explore how it could evolve in the coming decades.
These experts conducted a first-of-its-kind comprehen­sive analysis to evaluate future pathways for hydropower in the United States from the present through 2030 and 2050. The Hydropower Vision report defines the societal, environmental and economic benefits of hydropower in a scenario where U.S. hydropower could grow from 101 gigawatts (GW) of combined generating and storage capacity in 2015 to nearly 150 GW by 2050, with more than 50 percent of this growth by 2030.
KEY FINDINGS OF THE HYDROPOWER VISION REPORT
Although hydropower is the nation’s oldest form of renewable electricity, many actions and efforts remain critical to further advancement of domestic hydropower as a key energy source of the future. These include continued technology development that lowers costs and the availability of market mechanisms that take into account the value of the grid reliability services, air quality and reduced emissions that hydropower provides.
Hydropower has the potential to support more than 195,000 jobs across the nation in 2050.
By 2050, hydropower can reduce cumulative greenhouse gas emissions by 5.6 gigatonnes -- equivalent to nearly 1.2 billion passenger vehicles driven in a year -- saving $209 billion from avoided global damages from climate change.
By 2050, hydropower can save 30 trillion gallons of water, equivalent to roughly 45 million Olympic-size swimming pools.
By 2050, hydropower can save $58 billion from avoided healthcare costs and economic damages from air pollution.
New pumped-storage hydropower technology can further integrate variable generation resources, such as wind and solar, into the national power grid because of its ability to provide grid flexibility, reliability and reserve capacity.
Developing a comprehensive set of science-based environmental performance metrics and assessment tools will further the design and sustainable operation of hydropower projects.
ROADMAP TO THE FUTURE OF U.S. HYDROPOWER
Although the Hydropower Vision report does not make any policy recommendations, it does provide a roadmap that sets forth actions that the hydropower industry, research community and others can take to achieve higher levels of hydropower deployment within a sustainable national energy mix.
Carrying out the roadmap actions will usher in a new era of growth in sustainable domestic hydropower, while protecting the nation’s energy, environmental and economic interests. The five “action areas” that would help achieve the Hydropower Vision include:
Technology Advancement: Developing innovative technologies will help reduce costs and improve both power production efficiencies and environmental performance.
Sustainable Development and Operation: This includes using integrated approaches that balance environmental, social and economic factors.
Enhanced Revenue and Market Structures: Appropriate compensation and incentives for new and existing hydropower are needed given the numerous energy production and grid support services it provides.
Regulatory Process Optimization: This includes increasing access to shared data, making information on relevant scientific advances available, enhancing process efficiency and reducing risks and costs.
Enhanced Collaboration, Education and Outreach: Sharing best practices for maintaining, operating and constructing facilities and developing curricula for programs to train new hydropower professionals are needed to usher in the next era of hydropower.
The Energy Department is proud to have worked with several hundred experts and organizations, including our national laboratories, to develop this vision for America’s hydropower future. As a domestic source of renewable energy, hydropower has the potential to continue to provide clean, reliable and affordable electricity to consumers for decades to come.

hydro power plants are killing the fun
Once again a city I built is at a stage where a hydro power plant makes the most sense to generate electricity.

I saved enough money for that and can also purchase up to two new land areas nearby. So I look around, and find some kind of river spring. It has a strong current, is nestled in a steep valley and the river it creates is neither too wide nor too small.

So, I save the game and attempt to build a dam there. No chance, it always says ""slope too steep"" or whatever. Trying all that took me like 30 minutes or so.

Then I loaded my savegame and looked for another area. There I found a river, but the area is a bit flat and the river is a bit wide, but I try it anyway. I buy the land and see how a dam would work out there: not very well. It simply wouldn't create enough power to make sense and cost too much.

So I load the savegame again and look around, but the only feasable place I see is that spring. So I buy that land again and try it again. I try more points how to build the dam, and behold: there I find a place: the dam would generate over 700mw and cost less than 300k. What a steal! I build the dam, connect it to the city with roads and a power line. Then I fast forward the game.

The water level upriver of the dam is rising, and rising... Dam still doesn't produce energy... Then the water level is falling again. Then it's rising again, then falling again... Then staying low... Weeks pass by, and still 0 power.

Ok, something didn't work here. I don't know what it didn't work, so I load up my savegame and try it again, placing the dam slightly different, more centered of the river. I fast forward the game: same thing, water level rises, falls, no energy produced.

I check the currents, and the currents around the dam stopped. I guess they stopped because I built the dam there? Does that mean that building the dam killed that spring which is why it doesn't produce energy? I have no idea.

All that took me now a couple of hours. And all I want is a working hydro power plant. I want to play the game. My people are screaming for new zones, I still have to create that railway and see how that city highway I built works out. I want to play the game, but instead I get frustrated with that power plant and lose motivation to play the game.

It feels as if I created a space ship by hand from scratch, and now I can't fly into space because some tiny lamp is having a lose contact and I now spend years fiddling it back and forth instead of doing something interesting.

I sympathise with you and I understand how difficult mastering dam building can be. This guide should help ;)
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=643348291
Even if you don't want max output, the theory alone should help you succeed. Good luck and keep going ;)

In terms of cost effectiveness, this is how all of the various power sources rate against a dam:
At 427MW, a dam is better than a solar plant.
At 321MW, a dam is better than any wind plant.
At 257MW, a dam is better than a nuclear plant. (Not considering 1.92k m³ water / week!)
At 229MW, a dam is better than a coal plant. (Not considering cost of resource burned!)
At 201MW, a dam is better than an oil plant. (Not considering cost of resource burned!)
At 27MW, a dam is better than an incineration plant.
So, as long as you can generate more than 427MW consistently from a dam, you will have the cheapest power producer. The only power producer that performs better than a max output dam is the Fusion Power Plant.
And besides, dams have more uses than just generating power. They can create lakes behind a dam, they can tame mighty rivers and create more habitable areas. They can even become a main aesthetic feature of your city.
Sure, dams aren't suitable for every map or every city and neither are nuclear plants, but they sure are fun ;)

Thanks for the advice, but I always try to perform well on maps the way they come. Using modding tools doesn't really work like that. :)

But I can't find any useful place for a dam on this winter map.

If you are referring to the 3 default maps supplied by CO, then yeah they're all very flat and not suitable for natural dams. You'll have to design your own map or subscribe to one. Or the simple placement of water spawners using the ELT mod, even if you don't wish to terraform, can make all the difference.

Islands have a suitable place for a max output dam, but it's on the edge of the 25tiles if I remember correctly, so you can do it, but it's for the late stage of the city.

Well, I used the money I saved for the dam to build some geothermal plants and upgrade all pipes. That did cost about the same and also saved a lot of energy. :)

Most of the stock maps are poorly made to utilize the hydropowers well. If you want more realistic use of them you should look at user made maps where there is a bigger chance of the dam to have high power output. I made a canyon map where i can easily build powerfull dams

That way looks stupid in my mind. I prefer whole maps suited for it with a little better looking way of doing it.

As i said. It cant be done easily on stock maps without cheats/mods for terrain altering. You can do it without that by using user made maps well suited for it

I deliberately built a stand alone dam for the purpose of that guide to focus on the theory and application, which does indeed make it a lot easier and allows you to place a dam on any map without having to search for a suitable one. I see no stupidity in that.
I was unconcerned with how it looks. The aethetics as I said, I leave to the player.
If looks are that important to you, I believe this dam which used the river should should be sufficient.

If there is no river on the map meant for a powerfull dam and you just build a dam somewhere on the edge of the map makes it feel like cheating/unatural to me. So for me i prefer natural looking Dams on actuall rivers not just appearing somewhere just infront of the dam. Or else i can nicely build nuclear/solar power instead if the map doesn't have the river for it. I dont cheat in terrain tools just for that after starting the city. But that is my opinion.
The city on my new canyon map is growing. Hopefully the waterlevels wil soon be reaching the canals in my city with help of the dam.

If I get it correctly, solar power plants generate zero electricity during the night. What I'd really like to see in the game would be buildings that save the energy. Like, a pumped-storage hydroelectricity powerplants, where you create a lake at the top of a hill and at its bottom, and while you have excess energy the water is pumped up, and when you need energy it flows down to power turbines and generate electricity.

Nah. I would like the method they use in irl. Solar plants heating up salt (or whatever it was) and the rest heat is stored for night use,

 Micro hydro power plant
1. MICRO-HYDRO POWER PLANT SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
2. HYDRO POWER  Hydropower transforms the potential energy of a mass of water flowing in a river or stream with a certain vertical fall (termed the “head”) Hydroelectric power is the cheapest source of energy, renewable and environmentally benign during running. The potential annual power generation of a hydropower project is proportional to the head and flow of water 2 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
3. 3SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
4. CLASSIFICATION OF HYDROPOWER PLANTS : Classification of hydropower plants According to Capacity Large Medium Small Mini Micro Pico According to head High Medium Low According to purpose Single purpose Multi purpose According to facility types Run-of-River Reservoirs In-stream Pumped storage According to hydrological relation Single Cascade According to transmission system Isolated Connected to grid 4SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
5. Micro-hydro Power  Micro-hydro power is a type of Hydro electric power that typically produced up to 100 kW of electricity using the natural flow of water.  These type of power plant can provide power to an isolated home or a small community. Micro- hydro system complement solar energy because in many areas in winter the water flow is maximum and solar energy is minimum.  In such areas micro-hydro power is used along with photo voltaic solar energy. 5 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
6. VARIOUS COMPONENTS Construction of a Micro-hydro power plant is site specific. It is made up of a number of components. Some of them are……  Intake  Canal  Penstock  Turbine  Generator  Controlling unit 6 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
7. 7SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
8. TURBINES  Turbines converts the flow and pressure energy into mechanical energy.  Turbines are basically of two types i.e. Reaction & Impulse and Depending upon the head of the available water further divide in three categories i.e. High, Medium & Low head.  According to site specification (i.e. head and flow) we choose the turbine to use in micro- hydro power plant. 9 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
9. Turbine type Flow Head Pelton wheel Low High ( > 70 feet) Turgo Medium Medium (25-75 feet) Cross Flow High Low (<25 feet) 10 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
10. GENERATORS The standard generators used in micro hydro power projects are the synchronous generator and the induction motor used as a generator. Induction generator :- Induction generator usually an induction motor. Which rotates 1-5% faster then synchronous speed so that it can achieve negative slip, to run in generating mode. 11 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
11. Synchronous generator :- Salient pole Synchronous generator or alternator are used in micro-hydro projects. These generator supplies its own excitation through rectifier or external batteries system can be used for excitation. Some times industrial pumps (i.e. centrifugal) are use as generator. Continued… 111 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
12. ELECTRONIC LOAD CONTROLLER Water turbines vary in speed as load is applied. This speed variation will seriously affect both frequency and voltage output from a generator. To over come this problem electronic load controller is used in micro-hydro power plant. 13 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
13. The ELC prevents speed variations by continuously adding or subtracting an artificial load, so that the generator is working permanently under full load. A further benefit is that the ELC has no moving parts, it is very reliable and maintenance free. Continued…. 14 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
14. Disadvantages  Economic energy source.  No reservoir required.  Utilize natural flow of water.  No harmful effect on surrounding.  No costly equipment used.  Low power generation during summer months.  Suitable site characteristics required.  Efficiency is low . Advantages 15 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
15. Conclusion… Micro-hydro power plant is an important part of world’s electricity supply. Specially in remote areas it is providing reliable and economic source of electricity. As no fossil fuel required in hydro power plant, it can help to save other source of energy. 16 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI
16. THANK YOU… 17 SARAVANAN SIVAMANI

The Pupu Hydro Power Scheme is a small hydroelectric power station near Tākaka in the Golden Bay region of the South Island of New Zealand. It opened in 1929 as the first power station in the region and was the first public electricity supply in Golden Bay.[1] After closing in 1980 following damage to the generator, the power scheme was fully restored by the local Pupu Hydro Society and many volunteer groups over the course of seven years and re-opened in 1988, again supplying electricity to the national grid.[2]
The scenic Pupu Hydro Walkway follows the historic gold mining water-race between the penstock and the weir at Campbell Creek, before returning along the opposite side of the valley.[3] The track was opened in 2003[1] and also leads past the power house, where a window provides a view into the turbine room.
Construction[edit]
The first water-race was constructed from 1901 to 1902 by the Takaka Sluicing Company over 8 months by a crew of 24 men working 8-hour shifts. It diverted water from Campbell Creek at a gentle gradient along the steep hillside, travelling over several timber aqueducts along its original 3.7 kilometres (2.3 mi) course. The gold claim in the Waikoropupu Valley was worked from the 1850s until around 1910.[4]
Following a public meeting in 1924, an interim power board was formed to investigate the development of a local hydro scheme in response to the increasing promotion of electricity as a new energy source following the 1918 Electric Power Boards Act. The proposed Pupu Hydro Power Scheme was however deemed uneconomical by the central government, and local rate payers voted to take on a loan of £24,000 and proceed with the construction, which involved upgrading the disused Campbell Creek water-race, building a penstock and a powerhouse.[1]
On 11 October 1929, the Golden Bay Electric Power Board officially opened the power scheme, lighting up the first public electricity supply in Golden Bay and enabling households to have access to electric lighting, appliances and radio.[1]
This scheme, and the later Onekaka Hydro Scheme, allowed Golden Bay's power generation to be self-sufficient up until 1944, when the much larger Cobb Power Station began generating power into the national grid and the Golden Bay Electric Power Board started taking supply from the main grid.[5]
The Pupu Power Scheme survived as an emergency backup, and apart from lightning strike damage in 1956 continued to operate until 1980 when the alternator stator burned out in a 'flashover' short circuit. After 51 years of operating reliably, the shut down power scheme was put up for tender in 1980.[1]
Restoration[edit]
Pupu Hydro Powerhouse turbine room
Following 7 years of negotiations from 1981 to 1987, an agreement was signed between the Tasman Electric Power Board and the Pupu Hydro Society to take on a loan and fully restore the Pupu Hydro Power Scheme as a working ""museum"".[1]
The water race and penstock were partly rebuilt, a motorised filter and new control gates were installed, and a spillway weir was constructed. The powerhouse was renovated and all equipment was either restored, refurbished or replaced. The 250 kVA 400 V alternator from 1929 was rewound and reinsulated by the ASEA New Zealand branch, the original supplier of the generator. The stator pack was completely replaced, control gear and relays were refurbished, and the Boving twin-jet pelton wheel was recast with 24 new buckets.[6]
After completion of the restoration at an estimated total cost of $280,000, and with the strong support from many local groups and volunteers, the fully restored Pupu Hydro Power Scheme was reopened on 10 April 1988 once again as a fully operational hydroelectric power station.[6]
Later in 1991, the Pupu Hydro Society purchased the powerhouse and the surrounding 1 acre (0.4 ha) of land from the Tasman Electric Power Board, and in 2003 finished construction of the loop track.[1]
Current operation[edit]
The 107 metres (351 ft) drop from the headpond down the penstock to the powerhouse yields a strong 152 pounds per square inch (1,050 kPa) of water pressure, which is regulated by a valve at the powerhouse. Twin jets of water power the Boving twin-speer pelton wheel with a maximum water flow of 350 litres per second. The alternator is rated at 250 kW and supplies 400 V, stepped up to 11 kV to feed into the main power grid.[2]
Average annual energy output is 1.8 GWh, well up from the original power scheme's 0.8 GWh/year output.[2]
The Pupu Hydro Scheme is listed as an historic site by Heritage New Zealand.[7]
The Pupu Hydro Society continues to provide maintenance of the power scheme, funded by the sale of generated power on the spot-price electricity market. Excess profits go back into various Golden Bay community projects.[1]
Pupu Hydro Walkway[edit]
The Pupu Hydro Walkway is a 1.5 to 2 hour loop track starting at the end of the unsealed Pupu Valley Road, past the more well-known Pupu Springs.[3] The walk passes through the mature podocarp and beech forest of Kahurangi National Park, first zig-zagging up to the penstock, and then following the gentle gradient of the historic gold mining water-race along the steep hill side for 1.7 kilometres (1.1 mi) on a narrow boardwalk. The concrete water race and the boardwalk have been restored, including continuous railing on the sections along steep drop-offs.
After reaching the intake weir at Campbell Creek, the track returns via a gravel track on the opposite side of the valley. The Pupu Hydro Powerhouse is a 1-minute walk from the car park, with a viewing window and information panels about the power scheme, its history and restoration.[3]

James Buchanan Duke (1856-1925)
James Buchanan Duke (1856-1925)
View a timeline of James Buchanan Duke's life.
James Buchanan Duke was born near Durham, North Carolina on December 23, 1856 to Washington Duke and his second wife, Artelia Roney Duke. James B. Duke received an intermittent education in local academies. Later he briefly attended the New Garden School in Greensboro, NC (now Guilford College) and the Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York. His primary education, however, was in the family's business—first farming, then the hand manufacture and ""drumming"" (marketing) of tobacco products, and finally, the mass production and mass marketing of cigarettes.
At the age of twenty-eight, Buck, as he was called, opened a branch of the family's factory in New York City, which within five years was furnishing half the country's total production of cigarettes. After a ""tobacco war"" among the five principal manufacturers, Duke emerged as the president of the American Tobacco Company, which within a decade became a multinational corporation. Through numerous foreign and domestic combinations, Duke interests controlled the manufacture of a variety of tobacco products until the United States Supreme Court in 1911 ordered the dissolution of the tobacco trust as a combination in restraint of trade.
Duke's older brother, Benjamin Newton, had launched the family into the textile business as early as 1892. As their textile interests developed, the need for economical water power led the Dukes into the hydroelectric generating business. In 1905, they founded the Southern Power Company, now known as Duke Power, one of the companies making up Duke Energy, Inc. Within two decades, this company was supplying electricity to more than 300 cotton mills and various other factories, electric lines, and cities and towns primarily in the Piedmont region of North and South Carolina.
Lifelong Methodists, the two brothers practiced the kind of financial stewardship encouraged by their church and instilled in them by their father. Ardent Republicans and sympathetic to the downtrodden, the Dukes, individually and collectively, gave to a number of causes. In December, 1924, James B., who was by far the wealthiest member of the family, established The Duke Endowment as a permanent trust fund with designated beneficiaries. In so doing, he was following the family's long-standing patterns of philanthropy. In 1892, Washington Duke had helped a Methodist-related institution, Trinity College, relocate to Durham, and since 1887 Ben had been a member of the school's Board of Trustees. A new university built around Trinity was to be the prime beneficiary of the Duke Endowment, and at the insistence of Trinity President William Preston Few, the college was re-chartered as Duke University in honor of Washington Duke and his family.
Duke limited his philanthropy to the areas served by the power company. In addition to Duke University, he designated annual income to be distributed to non-profit hospitals and child care institutions for blacks and whites in the Carolinas, to rural Methodist churches and retired Methodist preachers in North Carolina, and to three other institutions of higher education: Furman University (Greenville, SC), Johnson C. Smith University (Charlotte, NC), and Davidson College (Davidson, NC). One of the largest foundations in the United States, the Duke Endowment, with offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, has now distributed more than one billion dollars to its beneficiaries.
After a brief marriage that ended in divorce, James B. Duke married a widow from Atlanta, Nanaline Holt Inman, in 1907. One daughter, Doris, was born to the couple. James B. Duke died in New York City on October 10, 1925, and is interred with his father and brother in the Memorial Chapel on the campus of Duke University.

Which countries produce the most hydroelectric power?
Oct 14, 2015
Joe Myers
Writer, Forum Agenda
As the world attempts to stall climate change by cutting emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, energy from renewable sources has become an integral part of global strategies. But hydroelectric power, despite being an important energy source in many nations around the world, is often overlooked.
The 2012 data in the chart below is taken from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), which provides independent national and international energy statistics.
China produces the most electricity from hydroelectric power, some 856.4 billion kilowatt hours a year – more than double the amount produced by Brazil, in second place. The top three is completed by Canada, which produces 376.7 billion kilowatt hours a year.
Alongside the United States, in fourth, there are also places for Norway, Sweden, India, Venezuela and Japan, showing the geographical dispersion of hydroelectric power production.

Hydroelectric Power Plant : Layout, Working And Types
By Kiran Daware Power System

Generation of electricity by hydropower (potential energy in stored water) is one of the cleanest methods of producing electric power. In 2012, hydroelectric power plants contributed about 16% of total electricity generation of the world. Hydroelectricity is the most widely used form of renewable energy. It is a flexible source of electricity and also the cost of electricity generation is relatively low. This article talks about the layout, basic components and working of a hydroelectric power station.
Layout And Working Of Hydroelectric Power Plant

The above image shows the typical layout of a hydroelectric power plant and its basic components.

Dam and Reservoir: The dam is constructed on a large river in hilly areas to ensure sufficient water storage at height. The dam forms a large reservoir behind it. The height of water level (called as water head) in the reservoir determines how much of potential energy is stored in it.

Control Gate: Water from the reservoir is allowed to flow through the penstock to the turbine. The amount of water which is to be released in the penstock can be controlled by a control gate. When the control gate is fully opened, maximum amount of water is released through the penstock.

Penstock: A penstock is a huge steel pipe which carries water from the reservoir to the turbine. Potential energy of the water is converted into kinetic energy as it flows down through the penstock due to gravity.

Water Turbine: Water from the penstock is taken into the water turbine. The turbine is mechanically coupled to an electric generator. Kinetic energy of the water drives the turbine and consequently the generator gets driven. There are two main types of water turbine; (i) Impulse turbine and (ii) Reaction turbine. Impulse turbines are used for large heads and reaction turbines are used for low and medium heads.

Generator: A generator is mounted in the power house and it is mechanically coupled to the turbine shaft. When the turbine blades are rotated, it drives the generator and electricity is generated which is then stepped up with the help of a transformer for the transmission purpose.
Surge Tank:
Surge tanks are usually provided in high or medium head power plants when considerably long penstock is required. A surge tank is a small reservoir or tank which is open at the top. It is fitted between the reservoir and the power house. The water level in the surge tank rises or falls to reduce the pressure swings in the penstock. When there is sudden reduction in load on the turbine, the governor closes the gates of the turbine to reduce the water flow. This causes pressure to increase abnormally in the penstock. This is prevented by using a surge tank, in which the water level rises to reduce the pressure. On the other hand, the surge tank provides excess water needed when the gates are suddenly opened to meet the increased load demand.

Types Of Hydro-Power Plants
Conventional Plants:
Conventional plants use potential energy from dammed water. The energy extracted depends on the volume and head of the water. The difference between height of water level in the reservoir and the water outflow level is called as water head.
Pumped Storage Plant:
In pumped storage plant, a second reservoir is constructed near the water outflow from the turbine. When the demand of electricity is low, the water from lower reservoir is pumped into the upper (main) reservoir. This is to ensure sufficient amount of water available in the main reservoir to fulfil the peak loads.
Run-Of-River Plant:
In this type of facility, no dam is constructed and, hence, reservoir is absent. A portion of river is diverted through a penstock or canal to the turbine. Thus, only the water flowing from the river is available for the generation. And due to absence of reservoir, any oversupply of water is passed unused.
Advantages Of A Hydroelectric Power Plant
No fuel is required as potential energy is stored water is used for electricity generation
Neat and clean source of energy
Very small running charges - as water is available free of cost
Comparatively less maintenance is required and has longer life
Serves other purposes too, such as irrigation
Disadvantages
Very high capital cost due to construction of dam
High cost of transmission – as hydro plants are located in hilly areas which are quite away from the consumers

The Question of ‘Disruptive Technologies’: some heretical thoughts
IN MY OPINION

disruptive technologiesHeideggerimplications of technologyPanos Vlachopoulos
Video introduction and overview
Imagine the river Rhine
Imagine the landscape of the river Rhine: an image of nature in its full natural essence. The river flows freely without any disruption. There is only the natural noise of the water and no human intervention. Martin Heidegger, one of the most influential thinkers of our era, invited us to consider the river as a metaphor for human ability to understand and use technology. In his essay ‘The Question Concerning Technology’, he asked us to imagine the same landscape again, but this time with a wooden bridge that has connected the two banks of the river for hundreds of years. The essence of the river remains the same: the water flows freely, there are no major disruptions to the ecosystem and no pollution as a result of this human intervention in the landscape. The river retains its own value, we simply cross over it. Now consider the landscape with a hydroelectric plant built into the river. A dam has been created, the river flow has been changed and the water is now being used to run a power station. The essence of the river and the way we see and use it have changed because of this intervention. Heidegger hates the dam not because it damages the river but because it reduces it to something else, something that no longer stands on its own.
Heidegger’s essay has recently attracted attention in the field of educational technology. The essay itself is very complicated, so I am not going to attempt to analyse or critique Heidegger’s position on technology. However I feel that there is an important point worth putting forward for further thinking and discussion in relation to creation and disruption with new and emerging technologies.
‘Bringing-forth’ and ‘challenging-forth’
Humans are capable of two aligned but distinct ways of bringing about things:
“bringing-forth”, in which humans only give form to what already exists without disruption and control
“challenging-forth”, where humans control the productive process and, according to Heidegger, reduce it to something else, often inferior to its true essence.
For example, a forest full of trees may be seen by humans as a national park where they can enjoy and co-exist with nature (‘bringing-forth’) or it can be seen as a commodity, as a source of furniture or paper (‘challenging-forth’). A debate about whether ‘bringing-forth’ or ‘challenging-forth’ are arbitrary constructs is beyond the scope of this opinion paper but I will attempt to make a parallelism with learning and technology. Please bear with me as I unpack my syllogism.
Technologies and learning
Learning is a natural process that has been part of our existence since we were first considered modern-day humans. It is the river that naturally flows in our and our students’ life. We invented schooling and pedagogies that are the wooden bridges between our own individual learning and education (and shape our learning in any given societal context). Still, the essence and value of learning remains the same and the individual learner is the core agent in the learning process. We can and we have built new bridges, that connect different parts of the river, but we have not considered changing the essence of the river itself: the essence of what ‘to learn’ is. Not yet, Heidegger would argue, because of the technologies available to us. So, we haven’t actually disrupted the landscape. But can we really disrupt the landscape of learning? If we were to start building dams that aim to disrupt the flow of learning and eventually change the essence of it as we know it, have we considered what the new river will be? If, for example, we invent technologies that are able to think for us and offer us solutions to problems before we get an opportunity to problem solve; if we develop devices that can ‘help’ us transmit information to each other without the need to communicate verbally or in writing; or if we build a hydroelectric station in our river that would turn our thinking into big data that can be passed to anyone, then do we compromise the essence of learning by disrupting its ‘standing-on-its own’ nature and reducing it to information processing? Ellen Rose and other scholars have already started problematising the status of thought and learning with the use of new technologies.
My purpose is not to write against technology. What I propose is that we, the educational community, need to carefully consider the deeper implications when it comes to new and emerging technologies. We need to have a developed way of thinking that lies behind the creation and the use of technology. As Heidegger wrote “we can say ‘yes’ to the unavoidable use of technological objects, and we at the same time say ‘no’ insofar as we do not permit them to claim us exclusively and thus to wrap confuse and finally lay waste to our essence”.
Is there such a thing as disruption of learning without disruption of our own existence?

Learn how hydropower captures the kinetic energy of flowing water and turns it into electricity for our homes and businesses. | Video by the Energy Department.
U.S. Department of Energy
10. Hydropower is one of the oldest power sources on the planet, generating power when flowing water spins a wheel or turbine. It was used by farmers as far back as ancient Greece for mechanical tasks like grinding grain. Hydropower is also a renewable energy source and produces no air pollution or toxic byproducts. Learn more about the history of hydropower.
9. When most people think of hydropower, they imagine the Hoover Dam – a huge facility storing the power of an entire river behind its walls – but hydropower facilities can be tiny too, taking advantage of water flows in municipal water facilities or irrigation ditches. They can even be “dam-less,” with diversions or run-of-river facilities channeling part of a stream through a powerhouse before the water rejoins the main river.
8. Niagara Falls was the site of the country’s first hydroelectric generating facility -- built in 1881 when Charles Brush connected a generator to turbines powered by the falls and used the electricity to power nighttime lighting for visiting tourists. America’s first commercial hydropower facility(link is external) was built in 1882 in Appleton, Wisconsin -- powering lighting for a paper mill and multiple homes.
7. Every state uses hydropower for electricity, and some states use a lot of it. Over 70 percent of Washington State’s electricity comes from hydropower, and 11 states get more than 10 percent of their electricity from hydropower.
6. Hydropower costs less than most energy sources. States that get the majority of their electricity from hydropower, like Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, have energy bills that are lower than the rest of the country.
5. Hydroelectricity provides about seven percent of the electricity generated in the United States and about half of the electricity from all renewable sources, finds the Energy Information Administration(link is external).
4. Some hydropower facilities can quickly go from zero power to maximum output, making them ideal for meeting sudden changes in demand for electricity. Because hydropower plants can dispatch power to the grid immediately, they provide essential back-up power during major electricity disruptions such as the 2003 blackout that affected the northeastern states and southern Canada. Read a report about other services hydropower can provide to the electric grid.
3. Another type of hydropower called pumped storage works like a battery, storing the electricity generated by other power sources like solar, wind, and nuclear for later use. It stores energy by pumping water uphill to a reservoir at higher elevation from a second reservoir at a lower elevation. When the power is needed, the water is released and turns a turbine, generating electricity.
2. Devices at dams can help fish and other wildlife move freely around dams and between sections of rivers. Fish ladders and fish elevators are just some of the techniques used to help fish migrate.
1. Dams are built for a number of uses in addition to producing electricity, such as irrigation, shipping and navigation, flood control or to create reservoirs for recreational activities. In fact, only 3 percent of the nation’s 80,000 dams currently generate power. An Energy Department-funded study found that 12 gigawatts of hydroelectric generating capacity could be added to existing dams around the country. View the full report and the interactive map on the energy potential of non-powered dams.

QUICK FACTS
New York law requires 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and 100% carbon-free electricity from both renewable sources and nuclear energy by 2040. In 2022, renewable sources and nuclear power combined supplied 51% of New York's total in-state generation from utility-scale and small-scale facilities.
Nuclear power accounted for 21% of New York's utility-scale net generation in 2022, down from 34% in 2019 because the Indian Point nuclear power plant, one of the state's four nuclear power plants, shut down. The last two reactors at the Indian Point plant shutdown in 2020 and 2021.
In 2022, New York accounted for 11% of U.S. hydroelectricity net generation, and the state was the third-largest producer of hydropower in the nation, after Washington and Oregon.
New York consumes less total energy per capita than the residents in all but one other state, and per capita energy consumption in New York’s transportation sector is lower than in all other states.
New York’s per capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are consistently lower than those of any other state in the nation.

Generating green electricity through hydro power
Mankind has used the power of water for thousands of years to operate various machines such us sawmills, textile mills and corn mills. Today hydro power is a green renewable source of energy to produce electricity.  16% of the total produced energy worldwide comes from hydropower.
Flygt provides submersible hydro turbines of Semi-Kaplan types. Submerged operation below ground ensures invisible and quiet operation. Submersible turbines offer high operational efficiency and great reliability, no transmission shaft, couplings or intermediate bearings. Flygt hydro turbines are designed for small hydro plants where ease of installation and service is extremely important.
Generating electricity through fossil fuels
The process of generating electrical power goes under the name power generation, independent of the original source. Power plants require a reliable flows for cooling water, raw water intakes, condensation, auxiliary water and makeup water. In addition all power plants have wastewater streams that needs to be handled.
Since waste heat is an inevitable by-product in power plants, large water flows are needed for cooling. Water is often transported from a nearby river, lake or the sea. Reliability and energy efficiency are important since catastrophic pump failure can results in power plant shutdowns.

Residential Rates
Residential Conservation Rate
Most residential customers are charged under the Residential Conservation Rate. Residential customers under the Residential Conservation Rate receive service under rate schedule 1101 of the Electric Tariff.
Customers are charged one rate for electricity up to a certain threshold in each billing period, and a higher rate for all electricity use beyond that threshold. This ""stepped"" rate is designed to encourage conservation.
Note: In February 2023, we submitted an application to the B.C. Utilities Commission for a new optional time-of-use rate for residential customers. Learn more about the rate application. 
How your threshold is determined
On your bill, the threshold for the lower Step 1 rate is calculated by multiplying the number of days in the billing period by 22.1918 kWh per day.
Customer meters are read on different days so billing periods can vary from bill to bill. The 22.1918 kWh per day is the daily equivalent of 1,350 kWh for the average two month billing period.
For example, a 60-day billing period would have a Step 1 threshold of 1,332 kWh (60 days x 22.1918 kWh per day). A 58-day billing period would have a 1,287 kWh (58 days x 22.1918 kWh per day) Step 1 threshold.
Why do we have a Step 2?
The stepped rate structure provides a price incentive to encourage conservation–which is the cleanest, cheapest and simplest way to meet growing electricity demand.
Knowing how to read your BC Hydro residential customer bill is a good way to monitor and manage your electricity usage.
Basic Charge
A small, daily amount that partially recovers fixed customer-related costs, including customer service channels, metering, billing, payment processing, collections, and distribution system costs that are customer-related (electrical lines and transformers).
21.17 cents per day.
Energy Charge
Step 1
9.75 cents per kWh for first 1,350 in an average two month billing period (22.1918 kWh per day).
Step 2
14.08 cents per kWh over the 1,350 Step 1 threshold.
Minimum Charge
21.17 cents per day.
Equal to the Basic Charge.


Declaration of eligibility for Residential Service rate
The declaration indicates that the service address and meter number you're applying for is a residential dwelling and meets the BC Hydro Electric Tariff ('Tariff') definition for what qualifies for Residential Service where energy is used:
In a dwelling.
In a dwelling where a portion is used to carry on a business if the whole dwelling is supplied through one meter (e.g. home based business, or Bed & Breakfast with no more than 3 rooms to rent).
In the common areas of multiple occupancy buildings if such common areas are used only for the common benefit of the residential dwellings in that building.
If you meet these eligibility requirements and wish to be placed on the Residential Service rate, please submit your declaration [PDF, 37 KB] and required documents.
Exempt Residential Service Rate for farms
The Exempt Residential Service Rate is available to eligible farms. If you are currently on the Residential Conservation Rate but your property is classified as a farm and the electricity is for farm use, you may be eligible for the Exempt Residential Service Rate. Electricity service under the Exempt Residential Service Rate must not be used for:
Any dwelling other than a single-family dwelling.
The processing of farm products that aren't produced on your farm.
The selling of farm products or other products to the public, other than from a small roadside stand.
Any commercial use not normally carried out on a farm.
If you meet these eligibility requirements and wish to be placed on the Exempt Residential Service Rate, please submit your declaration [PDF, 74 KB] and required documents.
Customers under the Exempt Residential Service Rate receive service under rate schedule 1151 of the Electric Tariff.
Basic Charge
A small, daily amount that partially recovers fixed customer-related costs, including customer service channels, metering, billing, payment processing, collections, and distribution system costs that are customer-related (electrical lines and transformers).
22.58 cents per day.
Energy Charge
11.47 cents per kWh.
Minimum Charge
22.58 cents per day.
Equal to the Basic Charge.


Please note that in the event of differences between the details noted here and the official Electric Tariff issued by BC Hydro, the official Electric Tariff will prevail.

Security deposits for new electrical service
You may need to pay a security deposit to start electrical service at your home or business. Some reasons that we may require you to pay a security deposit include:
You have no credit history with BC Hydro.
We can't conduct an Equifax credit check.
An Equifax check shows a deposit is required.
You can't provide a reference letter from another utility.
The amount of the security deposit is different for each customer. It’s based on:
Your billing plan (e.g. whether you’re a residential or business customer).
A dollar amount that’s two or three times the estimated average monthly bill for your location.
The average monthly bills of similar dwellings where no historical consumption exists (e.g. for new buildings or homes).
The security deposit may be returned to you after two years of good payment history.
Waiving security deposits and reversing charges
In some cases, security deposits may be waived or reversed if a credit check is conducted and passed or if a credit reference letter is provided. The credit reference must be from another utility company (such as electric or gas utility, telephone, cellular or cable company) that confirms you have made on-time bill payments for 12 consecutive months.
To have a credit check performed, please contact us at 1 800 224 9376 and have your account number on hand. The security deposit may be returned to you after two years of good payment history.

Tears of Rangi: Water, power, and people in New Zealand
Anne Salmond

Abstract

In this article, I consider a series of exchanges and entanglements, convergences, and collisions involving ancestral Maori, Western, and modernist onto-logics in relation to fresh water in New Zealand. Maori (and by implication, non-Maori) rights to fresh water have been a topic of passionate, often confrontational debate, instigated by the privatization of local power companies. In an innovative response to a claim to the Waitangi Tribunal by Whanganui iwi (kin groups), the Whanganui River has been declared a legal being, one of the first rivers in the world to gain this status. In the Whanganui deed of settlement with the Crown, ancestral Maori and modernist framings are juxtaposed, despite being incommensurable in certain respects. Drawing upon divergent forms of order, participants in the process have sought to weave together a concerted approach toward the management of New Zealand's waterways. This interweaving avoids the need for a merging of horizons, a ""theory of everything"" in which only one reality is possible and only one set of assumptions about the world can prevail.

Hydropower
Conventional hydropower is one of the oldest and the nation's leading renewable energy resource. Power is produced by the fall of water which spins a turbine. The amount of power that can be generated depends on both the head (height of the drop) and the volume of water. At most conventional hydropower facilities, power production varies with seasonal water flow increases and decreases. Most projects are constructed on dams but some rely on water diversions at natural falls and through conduits.
The two main types of hydropower facilities are peaking/pulsing and run-of-river. Peaking facilities store water to be released during peak energy use times when demand and prices are highest. Pulsing facilities store less water and generate power until a lower limit is reached and then shut down to refill, but the pulse is not necessarily coordinated with peak energy use. Run-of-river facilities pass flows on a real-time basis, with outflow from the impoundment equaling inflow to the impoundment at all times.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates the development of non-federal hydroelectric projects. These projects comprise about half of the nation's developed hydroelectric capacity. The remainder are federally-owned projects that do not require FERC licensing. FERC has the exclusive jurisdiction to authorize non-federal hydroelectric projects that are:
on navigable waters in the United States;
on non-navigable waters over which Congress has jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause, were constructed after 1935, and affect interstate or foreign commerce;
on U.S. public lands or reservations; or
use surplus water or water power from any federal dam.
Hydropower represents about 2.5 percent of the nation's energy use. The largest concentrations of hydropower in the United States are on the West Coast and in the Northeast, and the best sites in the continental United States have already been exploited.
Fish and Wildlife Considerations
Water impounded by dams can create ponded lake habitat when riparian



and free-flowing-river habitats are inundated. This may result in changing the composition of the fish community and productivity of the ecosystem.
Dams block both upstream and downstream fish access to habitat, interfering with fish movement (e.g., migratory movement to spawning habitat, seasonal movement to overwintering habitat or daily feeding or territorial movements). Habitat fragmentation degrades the ecosystem and disrupts life cycles of fish and other aquatic species. A variety of fishway designs can safely pass fish upstream or downstream of dams, but many are species-specific and not as effective as movement in a free-flowing river. Fish may be killed when entrained (sucked into the turbines) or impinged (pinned against structures). Entrainment mortality varies by fish size and species, turbine type, head (heights of the drop) and other factors. Mortality ranges between five percent and nearly 100 percent. Various screens and barriers may help to minimize fish entrainment.
Hydropower operations may dewater a section of river (bypassed reach) when water is diverted through a pipeline or power canal. Minimum conservation flow into the bypassed reach may be required to protect fish and wildlife habitat. These flows may vary by season or try to mimic the natural hydrograph. Water levels in the project impoundment can vary considerably on a daily or seasonal basis, resulting in a relatively barren zone along the shoreline where few organisms can survive. Downstream fluctuations may also occur when flow through the turbines is varied. Water level concerns and downstream fluctuations may be minimized with run-of-river operations. Some projects are required to maintain protective impoundment levels during fish spawning or nursery seasons, or waterfowl or shorebird nesting seasons, and conservation flows below the project may be required.
Water quality may be impacted by increased water temperatures in the impoundment and downstream, sediment releases (turbidity), gas supersaturation, resuspension of toxic substances and reduced dissolved oxygen levels. These are all factors that impact the viability of fish and other aquatic life. These issues may often be addressed, at least to some extent, by modifications to project operations.
Working with others to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.

Washington Water Power
By Paige M. Nash
Washington Water Power (WWP), renamed Avista in 1999, is one of few local institutions to trace its history to when Washington was a territory. In early 1889, a group of Spokane businessmen organized to harness hydroelectric power from the Spokane River, incorporating as Washington Water Power. The first generator - the Dynamo - only provided enough power for ten street lamps. Once Washington Water Power took over that number grew to 1200 street lamps. However this initial success would soon be threatened by an unprecedented event.
The Great Fire of 1889 devoured the 32-block Spokane business district. With an estimated loss of $6,000,000.00 Spokane Fall’s recovery looked bleak. Washington Water Power, only a few months prior old, scrambled to restore electricity to the devastated city. Workers salvaged lights and fixtures wherever possible. Baling wire and barbed wire were used to restore electricity to Spokane’s charred business district.
Washington Water Power built its first hydroelectric generating facility on Monroe Street in 1890, and has been producing power from this location ever since. Located at the heart of downtown Spokane, the dam was instrumental in providing electric lighting for Spokane’s streets and businesses as opposed to lighting via candles and oil lamps. The dam was rebuilt just before the 1974 World’s Fair, and a new underground powerhouse was added in 1992, replacing the vintage 1900-era turbines and generators with a modern generating unit that produced twice the electrical power using the same amount of water flow. WWP also donated 5 acres for expos that later became part of the Spokane Riverfront development.
At the turn of the 20th century, WWP expanded beyond the Spokane city limits. In 1903, Washington Water power constructed the world’s largest transmission line, stretching from Spokane to the silver mines of Burke, Idaho. In 1908 the Nine Mile Hydroelectric Development opened coinciding with the peak years of Spokane’s Street Cars. Washington Water Power went on to build several other notable dams such as the Long Lake Hydroelectric Development in 1915 which possessed the world’s largest spillway.
Like other electric companies, WWP sought to increase the market for electricity with inventions and demonstrations. Demonstrations included the Annual Housekeeper’s week at the University of Idaho, the local appliance shop on wheels which took products directly to the streets, and cooking schools held at the Elks Temple. WWP employees even invented and improved electric appliances. Lloyd Copeman developed a temperature control for the electric stove in 1910. Another WWP employee invented the first electric home water heater, while WWP employee Guy Arthur made improvements to the heating coil to prevent mineral build up. WWP even built a series of all electric “model” homes in Spokane, several of which still stand today.

This waterfall represents an intersection between technology, artistry and natural wonder. Enter the Falls from the south and venture across a pedestrian footbridge toward the viewing platform. There, between the curtains of flowing water, you’ll find large boulder seating where you can sit and spy historic gears and hydroelectric equipment.
Thanks to shade structures, you can enjoy the Falls all year long.
This project represents one of a growing number of projects along the Valley’s canals. Over 80 miles of paved paths have been developed by cities working closely with SRP. These paths are ADA-compliant and oftentimes include lights, landscaping and commissioned public art.

Art at the Falls
Showcased on-site is the Phoenix Art Commission’s “WaterWorks at Arizona Falls” project. Designed by Lajos Héder and Mags Harries, two renowned Boston artists, this artistic experience highlights the history of the landmark. Read more on the blog. 
History of the falls
1880S 
As far back as the late 1800s, local Phoenicians enjoyed Arizona Falls. Much like today, they would gather near the cool water for picnics and viewing.
1902
Thanks to its steady flow, Arizona Falls became the site of the first hydroelectric power plant in Phoenix in 1902.
1911–1950
SRP rebuilt the plant in 1911. In 1913, the plant began delivering power again until it was shut down in 1950.
2003–TODAY
The hydroelectric plant was restored and reopened to the public in 2003. Today, it provides enough electricity to power 150 homes.
Generating capacity
Arizona Falls generates up to 750 kilowatts of clean, renewable electricity. (That’s enough to power up to 150 homes.)

Electricity generated by the plant is fed into SRP’s power grid.

The main features of a bill pending before the General Court, entitled ""A bill to promote the conservation, development and utilization of the water resources within the Commonwealth,"" provided for the organization of a corporation by three or more owners or lessees of a water mill or dam upon any run or waterway within the Commonwealth for the acquisition, construction and operation of storage reservoirs on such river or waterway in order to regulate its flow and increase its usefulness; that all such owners and lessees on such river or waterway, but no one else, were permitted, although not required, to become stockholders, that shares of stock could be transferred only to successors in title of the incorporators to the water privileges; that plans for the carrying out of the enterprise of acquiring and constructing reservoirs must be submitted to the department of public works, without whose approval the project could not go forward; that, following a public hearing, of which a prescribed notice to interested parties must be given, the department of public works might authorize the corporation to take, under the provisions of existing statutes relating to eminent domain, such lands or rights as were necessary for the construction of the reservoirs; that the operation of the reservoirs should be subject to the supervision of the department of public works and must be such as to maintain as nearly as is practicable a uniform flow of the stream for the greatest common advantage of the owners and lessees of the water mills and dams thereon; that the corporation, subject to the approval of the department of public works, should have authority to make agreements as to tolls with the owners and lessees of water mills and dams on the stream and to lease or make other disposition of the water-power its reservoirs developed, except that it should not engage in the generation of electricity; that, after ten years from the incorporation, the Commonwealth should have the right to take or to purchase all or any part of the corporate property on payment ""of the fair value thereof for the purpose of its use."" The justices of this court, in response to an order of the Senate relating to the proposed legislation, expressed as their opinions that
(1) The uses for which property might be taken by eminent domain under the provisions of the bill were public uses within the meaning of art. 49 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth;
(2) It is constitutionally competent under art. 49 of Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth for the General Court to restrict the participation in the benefits to be derived from the taking by eminent domain provided for in the bill to particular persons or corporations as therein specified;
(3) Under art. 49 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, it is not constitutionally essential that the public generally, without discrimination, should be entitled to participation in the benefits to be derived from the taking by eminent domain proceedings of property for the public uses specified in the bill;
(4) Certain provisions of the bill, while not as clear and certain in their terms as might be desired, did not for that reason render the bill invalid;
(5) It was assumed that certain imperfections in the bill, contained in obviously inaccurate statutory references, would be corrected before re-enactment, and they were not considered as bearing upon the constitutionality of the measure;
(6) No essential part of the bill would violate any provision either of the Constitution of this Commonwealth or of that of the United States.
THE following order was passed by the Senate on April 6, 1921, and was transmitted to the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court on April 11, 1921.
WHEREAS, There is pending before the General Court a bill, printed as House, No. 762, entitled ""An Act to promote the conservation, development and utilization of the water resources within the Commonwealth,"" and
WHEREAS, Grave doubt exists as to the constitutionality of the said bill if enacted into law; therefore be it
ORDERED, That the Senate require the opinions of the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court on the following important questions of law: —
(1) Are the uses for which property may be taken by eminent domain under the provisions of said bill public uses within the meaning of the Constitution of the Commonwealth?
(2) Having authorized the taking of property by eminent domain, as provided in said bill, is it constitutionally competent for the General Court to restrict the participation in the benefits to be derived from such taking to particular persons or corporations?
(3) Is it constitutionally essential that where property is taken for a public use by eminent domain proceedings, the public generally, without discrimination, shall be entitled to participate in the benefits to be derived from such taking?
(4) If enacted into law, would said bill be in any respect unconstitutional?
The bill, to which the order referred, was as follows:
An Act to promote the Conservation, Development and Utilization of the Water Resources within the Commonwealth.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:
SECTION 1. In this act, unless the context otherwise requires, ""department"" means the department of public works, and ""river"" means and includes any river or waterways within the Commonwealth and that part of all other rivers or waterways within the Commonwealth through which the waters of such river or waterway flow to the sea, whether such rivers or waterways be navigable or non-navigable. ""Owner"" means owner or lessee of a water mill or dam located within the Commonwealth. ""The corporation"" or ""corporation"" means any improvement company organized under the provisions of this act.
SECTION 2. Owners of water mills or dams on any river may, subject to the provisions of this act, organize themselves as a corporation for the purpose of regulating the flow and increasing the usefulness of such river by acquiring, constructing and operating storage reservoirs in and along said river within the Commonwealth.
SECTION 3. Upon the written application of three or more owners on any river in the Commonwealth to a justice of the peace, stating that they intend to organize a corporation under the provisions of this act, and the names of all owners on said river known to the applicants, he shall issue his warrant to one of the applicants directing him to call a meeting, to be held within the Commonwealth, of all said owners on said river and expressing in the warrant the time, place and purpose of the meeting. The meeting shall be called by publishing a notice containing the substance of the warrant, signed by the person to whom the warrant is directed, in a newspaper published in each county through which said river flows, once each week for three successive weeks prior to the meeting, and by mailing a copy thereof, by registered mail, fourteen days at least before the meeting to the owners named in said application. All meetings of the corporation shall be held within the Commonwealth.
SECTION 4. At such meeting, by vote of a majority in number of all owners of water mills or of dams located on said river, each water mill and each dam involved being entitled to a single representative, and a majority in interest of all said owners, said interest being measured in gross developed hydraulic horsepower of the respective developments, said owners may organize themselves as a corporation under the provisions of this act and the corporate name assumed shall contain the words ""improvement company"" at the end thereof. The organization shall be effected and certified to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and he shall issue his certificate of incorporation in the manner, set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of sections nine and ten of chapter seven hundred and forty-two of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and fourteen. Said corporation shall be in all other respects subject to the first ninety-one sections of said chapter, so far as the same may be applicable and not inconsistent herewith, but the approval of the issue of stock and bonds by said corporation shall vest in the department and said corporation may issue bonds to such amount in excess of the amount of its capital stock actually paid in at the time of such issue as the department may authorize. Any corporation which is an owner on said river, if authorized by vote of its stockholders so to do, may be represented at and participate in said meeting, and may acquire and hold shares in such improvement company.
SECTION 5. The owners participating in such first meeting for organization shall hold the franchise until the organization has been completed, but all owners on said river shall be entitled to take shares of the original capital stock authorized at said first meeting or any additional issue in proportion to their respective interests as defined in the preceding section or, in case of dispute, as determined by the department. Shares in said improvement company shall be transferable only to successors in title to said owners, and only upon approval of the department after a hearing thereon, and this restriction shall be so expressed on the certificates thereof.
SECTION 6. Before acquiring or constructing any storage reservoir, or incurring any obligations in connection therewith, other than for preliminary expenses, surveys and reports, the corporation shall file with the department plans and a statement of the cost of any reservoir to be acquired, and plans and specifications of any reservoir to be constructed, showing in detail the manner in which such reservoir is to be constructed and its estimated capacity and cost, and such other engineering and financial data as the department may require. The department after such notice as it may order, and a public hearing, shall consider the project in its relation to the public interest, and the interests of all owners of shares in the corporation whose dams or water mills are included in any plan submitted; and shall itself estimate the cost of each such reservoir and the advantages to accrue therefrom, and shall approve or disapprove the acquisition or construction thereof. If the department shall approve the acquisition or construction of any such reservoir, it shall by order authorize the acquisition or construction of the same in accordance with the plans and specifications as originally filed, or as the same may be amended by the department after notice and a public hearing. Such plans and specifications may thereafter during the progress of the work be modified by the corporation with the approval of the department after like hearing, notice and approval of owners as hereinbefore provided. The order of the department authorizing the acquisition or construction of such reservoir shall become void unless such reservoir shall be acquired or constructed within two years after the date of such order or within such further time as the department may determine, after such hearing, notice and approval.
SECTION 7. Upon petition of the corporation alleging that it is unable to acquire by purchase lands or rights described in said petition necessary for the construction of a storage reservoir authorized by the department and setting forth the name or names of the owner or owners of said lands or rights so far as known to the petitioner, the department may by order authorize the corporation to take such lands or rights by eminent domain in the manner provided by section one hundred and eighty-seven of chapter two hundred and fifty-seven of General Acts of the year nineteen hundred and eighteen.
Before authorizing such taking a public hearing shall be held, of which notice shall be served upon the owner or owners mentioned in said petition at least fourteen days before the hearing in the manner provided for the service of writs returnable to the Superior Court, and by such publication as the department may order. The department may require the corporation to give such security as the department may deem adequate for the payment of damages resulting from the taking. Nothing in this section shall authorize a corporation organized hereunder to take or injure a public water supply and the state department of health shall be notified of all hearings of petitions under this section.
SECTION 8. The provisions of chapter one hundred and ninety-six of the Revised Laws, and acts in amendment thereof and in addition thereto, shall apply to the flowage of lands of other persons by any dam constructed under the provisions of this act, save as is herein otherwise provided.
SECTION 9. The corporation shall so operate its reservoirs as to maintain as nearly a uniform flow of water at all times in said river as is practicable by storing surplus water in times of great supply, and discharging the same in times of drought and scarcity, in such manner as shall be for the greatest common advantage to the owners on said river. The operation of any storage reservoir shall be subject to the supervision of the department, which upon the petition of any interested party may from time to time by order direct the manner of operating the same, including the times when and the amounts of water which shall pass through the gates of any dam of the corporation. The corporation shall maintain in connection with its reservoir such weirs, gauges and other instruments, conveniently located and open to the inspection of the department, as shall indicate with substantial accuracy the amount of water which passes the gates of each reservoir and shall keep such record of rainfall, stream flow and storage facilities as may be approved from time to time by the department. The department may determine the height to which water may be raised by any dam or other structure erected or maintained by the corporation, and such height shall be indicated by permanent bench marks. Nothing in this act shall authorize the corporation to interfere with the normal flow of the river and nothing contained in this act shall be construed to limit the legal liability of the corporation for any damage caused to any owner in the establishment or operation of any reservoirs of the corporation.
SECTION 10. No storage reservoir constructed under the provisions of this act shall be abandoned or alienated by a corporation, except by permission of the department and subject to such conditions as it shall impose, after such notice as the department may order and a public hearing thereon.
SECTION 11. When the corporation has been organized it may, from time to time, subject to the approval of the department, make agreements relative to the payment of tolls by owners of water mills or dams on said river.
SECTION 12. A corporation organized under the provisions of this act may make such lease or other disposition of the water power created by any reservoir dam owned by it as the department after public hearing may approve: provided, however, that in no event shall the corporation itself engage in the generation of electricity.
SECTION 13. At any time after ten years from the date of its certificate of incorporation the Commonwealth shall have the right to take or purchase the whole or any part of the franchise, corporate property and all rights and privileges of said corporation on payment to said corporation of the fair value thereof for the purpose of its use; but if a part only of such franchise, corporate property, rights and privileges is so taken or purchased, there shall be added thereto the damages, if any, caused by its severance from the remainder of such franchise, corporate property, rights and privileges. In case the Commonwealth shall desire to exercise its rights hereunder and shall be unable to agree upon said fair value, the Supreme Judicial Court shall have jurisdiction in equity to ascertain and fix said fair value, and to enforce the right of the Commonwealth to the title and possession of said franchise, property rights and privileges upon payment thereof to the corporation as determined by the court.
SECTION 14. The corporation shall annually on or before the first day of February make a report to the department in a form prescribed by it for the preceding calendar year signed and sworn to by its president and treasurer and a majority of the directors. Such report shall contain in such detail as the department may prescribe full information with respect to its financial and physical operations and condition, and shall at all times furnish any information required by the department or its duly authorized employees. The corporation shall keep such records of the operation of its plant as the department may from time to time require. The department shall have free access for its members or duly authorized employees at any and all reasonable times to all the property, books, records, contracts, documents, papers and memoranda of said corporation.
SECTION 15. If within three years from the passage of this act the owners of the water mills and dams on any river shall have failed to acquire or develop storage reservoirs thereon, the department may devise projects and prepare plans and specifications and obtain estimates for regulating the flow and increasing the usefulness of such river. At such time or times during the preparation thereof, as the department may deem best, it shall give public hearings to the owners of water mills and dams on said river and to all other persons interested after such notice as the department may require, and upon the completion thereof it shall recommend to the parties in interest that they forthwith proceed with the projects so devised in accordance with the provisions of this act. In case of their failure to act within two years of the department's recommendation, the department shall submit the same to the next general court with such recommendations as it may deem proper.
SECTION 16. In furtherance of the purposes of this act the department may confer and advise with officials, boards and commissions of the Commonwealth, of the United States, and of States within the limits of which any of the rivers defined in section one rises or flows, or in which rivers and water resources exist capable of furnishing power to the industries of the Commonwealth, and may appear to be represented at hearings before legislative committees or officials, boards or commissions of the United States or other States relative to matters affecting the water resources or power available to the industries of the Commonwealth.
On April 26, 1921, the Justices returned to the Senate the following answers to the questions propounded in the order:
To the Honorable the Senate of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:
The Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court respectfully submit these answers to the questions set forth in the order of April 6, 1921, copy whereof is hereto annexed.
The general purpose of the pending bill, with reference to which the questions are put, is fairly stated in its title to be ""To promote the conservation, development and utilization of the water resources within the Commonwealth."" The means by which that general purpose is to be effectuated in any particular instance is, as set forth in the bill, the organization of a corporation, by three or more owners or lessees of a water mill or dam upon any river or waterway within the Commonwealth, for the acquisition, construction and operation of storage reservoirs on such river or waterway in order to regulate its flow and increase its usefulness. All such owners or lessees are permitted although not required to become incorporators, stockholders are confined to such owners and lessees, and shares of stock can be transferred only to successors in title to the water privileges of incorporators. Plans for acquiring and constructing reservoirs, together with estimates of cost and other financial and engineering data must be submitted to the department of public works, which shall consider the project in relation to the public interests and the interests of shareholders. It is only when approved by the department that the project may go forward.
The taking of property by eminent domain by such corporation for the construction of a storage reservoir may be authorized by the department of public works, and manifestly is within the intendment of the bill. Operation of the reservoirs is required so as to maintain as nearly as is practicable a uniform flow of the stream for the greatest common advantage of the owners of water mills or dams thereon. Authority is conferred upon such corporations to make agreements as to tolls with the owners of water mills or dams on such stream and to lease or make other disposition of the water power developed by any reservoir dam subject to the approval of the department. The right is reserved to the Commonwealth to take or to purchase, after ten years from the incorporation, all or any part of the corporate property at a fair valuation. Such corporation may not engage in the generation of electricity and most of its important functions are subject to the control or supervision of the department of public works. There are in the bill other provisions ancillary to its main features, which need not be recited in detail.
It seems clear from this outline of the provisions of the bill that its main design is to benefit those, so far as they choose to avail themselves of the facilities thereby afforded, who may be or who may hereafter become owners or lessees of dams and mills operated in whole or in part by water power within the Commonwealth, and those who may be able to make profitable use of water power generated from the reservoirs acquired or built by corporations organized under the act. These benefits are to be conferred by the purchase of existing or the construction of new reservoirs for the impounding of flood or other water not producing power directed to industrial uses, so that it may be released during times of low water and thus the flow of the stream at all seasons be equalized and stabilized. The power of eminent domain may be exercised for the construction of reservoirs for this purpose.
The bill apparently is framed in execution of power created by art. 49 of the Amendments to the Constitution ratified and adopted by the people on November 5, 1918. That article so far as material to the present inquiry declares that ""The conservation, development and utilization of the . . . water . . . resources"" of the Commonwealth are ""public uses"" and confers upon the General Court ""power to provide for the taking, upon payment of just compensation therefor, of lands and easements or interests therein, including water and mineral rights, for the purpose of securing and promoting the proper conservation, development, utilization and control thereof and to enact legislation necessary or expedient therefor."" That article establishes a principle of government. It must be interpreted in harmony with the other parts of the Constitution so as to make the whole a consistent frame of government. It must also be given such scope as to render it practically workable toward the accomplishment of those objects to which it appears to be directed. According to its terms, the property rights of the individual must yield under the mandate of the General Court to the enterprise of those interested in the development of water resources. The people have declared the conservation, development, utilization and control of water resources to be a public use to which all private uses must bend. The adoption of rational means for the furtherance of this end rests with the General Court.
It is apparent from the debates in the convention which proposed the amendment, that one of its aims was to set at rest the question whether the construction of dams for the development of water power for the advantage of privately owned water mills could be regarded as a public use. Whatever may have been the law concerning that subject hitherto, the amendment in unequivocal phrase makes that now a public use. It is unnecessary to review the history of our statutes and decisions concerning the mill acts and similar statutes to determine the state of constitutional law apart from the amendment. The words of the amendment in this respect are not open to doubt.
It must be presumed that the convention proposed and the people approved and ratified the Forty-ninth Amendment with reference to the practical affairs of mankind and not as a mere theoretical announcement. The development and utilization of water for power imports of necessity that water shall be impounded and suffered to flow, with considerable regularity, under an adequate head, upon a water, wheel. The science of hydraulics imposes imperative limitations as to the place and amount of power to be developed from any watershed or on any stream within the Commonwealth. Participation in the benefits of such development is inevitably restricted to comparatively few by the laws of nature concerning water power as at present understood. The development of water power always has been recognized as having peculiar features and limitations. The water course as it flows from its source to the sea affords opportunities for harnessing its current to the uses of man at every fall economically capable of being utilized by the erection of a dam. At every such fall a new potentiality arises for the production of power. The force of the water may be put to work again and again. The conservation of water as a natural resource must be inferred to have been declared in the amendment to be a public use with reference to the industrial situation existing in the Commonwealth at the time of its adoption and ratification as well as to that of the future. It is common knowledge that a large part of the head and fall on many streams in the Commonwealth is already put to use in driving the machinery of mills highly diversified in variety of product. If storage reservoirs are to be built on the upper reaches of such streams, the practicable employment of the water thus stored is by increasing the energy already developed by the appliances at such existing mills. This situation implies that the general public except as represented by the owners of such mills cannot share in the benefits of such new utilization of water resources.
A rational inference from the words of the amendment and the debate concerning it in the convention is that it is based on the thought that the economic value of the unused Massachusetts water power, limited as it is in quantity and ease of employment, cannot be realized without the interposition of some form of governmental aid and that the general welfare thus to be subserved is paramount to any private interest. It is a general principle of constitutional law that ordinarily private property can be taken only for a governmental use, the enjoyment and advantage of which is open on equal terms to the public. This is true as to water, light, transportation companies and other corporations privately owned but affected with a public interest and ordinarily given the right to exercise eminent domain. Public use implies public service. There must be a direct and immediate relation between the appropriation of private property and the public enjoyment. The circumstances may be such that only a small portion of the inhabitants may participate in the benefits of the enterprise. But the use or service must be of such character that in its essence it affects them as a community and not merely as individuals. Lowell v. Boston, 111 Mass. 454, 470. Opinions of the Justices, 204 Mass. 607; 211 Mass. 624. Salisbury Land Improvement Co. v. Commonwealth, 215 Mass. 371. Riverbank Improvement Co. v. Chadwick, 228 Mass. 242. Opinion of the Justices, 118 Maine, 503, 514, 515. See Budd v. New York, 143 U.S. 517, 549. As to water power the amendment has created an exception for the accomplishment of what is regarded as a public advantage not otherwise susceptible of being achieved even though the public has no direct use from the property taken. The general public cannot share in the use of water power development in the sense in which they share in the use of streets, ways, water supply, police and fire protection, railroads, harbor improvements and other functions of government as commonly understood. The public can enjoy water power development only through the general enlargement of manufacturing facilities, through the saving of labor and the conservation of coal and other fuels, and in other kindred ways. The people by the amendment have decided that this is a public use, for which the forces of the government may be invoked.
The provision as to damages to the private owner, whose land may be taken from him, provided in § 7 of the bill, is constitutional. Old Colony Railroad v. Framingham Water Co. 153 Mass. 561. Whitman v. Nantucket, 169 Mass. 147. So far as concerns property or rights not taken but damaged by operations under the bill, the provisions of § 7 in conjunction with those of § 9 are not as clear and certain in their terms as might be desired. It is difficult in advance to foresee all the kinds of injury which may be wrought under the bill. But we incline to say that in this respect the bill is not invalid. Saltonstall v. New York Central Railroad, ante, 391.
The bill in several sections refers to statutes which have been repealed by c. 282 of the General Laws because embodied in that compilation. This point as bearing on the constitutionality of the bill is not considered, because we assume that if the bill is enacted it previously will be perfected in these particulars.
We have not been able to perceive in the time at our disposal that any essential part of the bill violates any provision of the Constitution of this Commonwealth.
We are of opinion that the bill will not be held by the Supreme Court of the United States to contravene any provision of the Federal Constitution. There are expressions in some judgments of that court which standing alone might well be thought to be incompatible with the constitutionality of the bill. For example, it was said in Kaukauna Water Power Co. v. Green Bay Mississippi Canal Co. 142 U.S. 254, at page 273, that ""it is probably true that it is beyond the competency of the State to appropriate to itself the property of individuals for the sole purpose of creating a water power to be leased for manufacturing purposes. This would be a case of taking the property of one man for the benefit of another, which is not a constitutional exercise of the right of eminent domain."" It also has been stated: ""It is fundamental in American jurisprudence that private property cannot be taken by the Government, National or State, except for purposes which are of a public character, although such taking be accompanied by compensation to the owner. That principle, this court has said, grows out of the essential nature of all free governments."" Madisonville Traction Co. v. Saint Bernard Mining Co. 196 U.S. 239, 251. Similar statements are to be found in Missouri Pacific Railway v. Nebraska, 164 U.S. 403, and Hairston v. Danville Western Railway, 208 U.S. 598, 606. See also Opinion of the Justices, 118 Maine, 503; Helena Power Transmission Co. v. Spratt, 35 Mont. 108; Lucas v. Ashland Light, Mill Power Co. 92 Neb. 550; Minnesota Canal Power Co. v. Koochiching Co. 97 Minn. 429.
On the other hand, in numerous States the taking of private property by eminent domain under the mill acts has been held to be a public use apart from any such constitutional provision as is found in art. 49 of the amendments. Brown v. Gerald, 100 Maine, 351. Connecticut College v. Calvert, 87 Conn. 421. Rockingham County Light Power Co. v. Hobbs, 72 N.H. 531. Raystown Water Power Co. v. Brumbaugh, 246 Penn. St. 225. Burnham v. Thompson, 35 Iowa, 421. Sexauer v. Star Milling Co. 173 Ind. 342. Scudder v. Trenton Delaware Falls Co. Saxton, 694. Harding v. Funk, 8 Kans. 315. Miller v. Troost, 14 Minn. 365. Johnson v. Centerville Milling Co. 37 So. Dak. 1. Fisher v. Horicon Iron Manuf. Co. 10 Wis. 351. There are intimations to the same effect in some of our earlier decisions. See, for a review of them, Lowell v. Boston, 111 Mass. 454, 464-467; Turner v. Nye, 154 Mass. 579; Otis Co. v. Ludlow Manuf. Co. 186 Mass. 89; Duncan v. New England Power Co. 225 Mass. 155. In Holyoke Co. v. Lyman, 15 Wall. 500, it was said at pages 522, 523, by way of argument, ""the enterprise of erecting a dam to create power to operate mills is so far public in its nature that it is competent for the Legislature to exercise the power of eminent domain to accomplish the purpose, if suitable provision is made to compensate the owners of the property or rights condemned under that power."" See, however, Head v. Amoskeag Manuf. Co. 113 U.S. 9, 21.
The people of this Commonwealth have declared by the Forty-ninth Amendment that the development of water power such as is authorized by the bill is a public use. The tendency of recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States has been to accept as true in its application to local conditions a constitutional declaration of a State to the effect that a given expropriation of private property is to a public use. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, 164 U.S. 112. Wurts v. Hoagland, 114 U.S. 606. Clark v. Nash, 198 U.S. 361. Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co. 200 U.S. 527. O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U.S. 244, 253. Houck v. Little River Drainage District, 239 U.S. 254. Mt. Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Co. v. Alabama Interstate Power Co. 240 U.S. 30. Jones v. Portland, 245 U.S. 217. Green v. Frazier, 253 U.S. 233. Walls v. Midland Carbon Co. 254 U.S. 300. Block v. Hirsh, decided by the United States Supreme Court on April 18, 1921. Under all these circumstances, in the light of the decisions just cited, we are of opinion that the Supreme Court of the United States would be likely to uphold the bill if enacted into law as not violative of any provision of the Constitution of the United States.
Therefore, confining ourselves strictly to the proposed bill, we answer questions one and two in the affirmative, and questions three and four in the negative.

344,A brief history of hydropower,https://www.hydropower.org/iha/discover-history-of-hydropower,20148-20148,"A brief history of hydropower
From its earliest beginnings to the modern era
Some of the first innovations in using water for power were conceived in China during the Han Dynasty between 202 BC and 9 AD. Trip hammers powered by a vertical-set water wheel were used to pound and hull grain, break ore, and in early paper-making.
The availability of water power has long been closely associated with kick-starting economic growth. When Richard Arkwright set up Cromford Mill in England’s Derwent valley in 1771 to spin cotton and so set up one of the world’s first factory systems, hydropower was the energy source he used.
‍Inventions in turbine technology ‍
Some of the key developments in hydropower technology happened in the first half of the ninteenth century. In 1827, French engineer Benoit Fourneyron developed a turbine capable of producing around 6 horsepower – the earliest version of the Fourneyron reaction turbine.
In 1849, British–American engineer James Francis developed the first modern water turbine – the Francis turbine – which remains the most widely-used water turbine in the world today. In the 1870s, American inventor Lester Allan Pelton developed the Pelton wheel, an impulse water turbine, which he patented in 1880.
Into the 20th century, Austrian professor Viktor Kaplan developed the Kaplan turbine in 1913 – a propeller-type turbine with adjustable blades.
The first hydropower projects
The world’s first hydroelectric project was used to power a single lamp in the Cragside country house in Northumberland, England, in 1878. Four years later, the first plant to serve a system of private and commercial customers was opened in Wisconsin, USA, and within a decade, hundreds of hydropower plants were in operation.
In North America, hydropower plants were installed at Grand Rapids, Michigan (1880), Ottawa, Ontario (1881), Dolgeville, New York (1881), and Niagara Falls, New York (1881). They were used to supply mills and light some local buildings.
By the turn of the century the technology was spreading round the globe, with Germany producing the first three-phase hydro-electric system in 1891, and Australia launching the first publicly owned plant in the Southern Hemisphere in 1895. In 1895, the world’s largest hydroelectric development of the time, the Edward Dean Adams Power Plant, was created at Niagara Falls.
By 1900 hundreds of small hydropower plants were in operation as the emerging technology spread across the world. In China, in 1905, a hydroelectric station was built on the Xindian creek near Taipei, with an installed capacity of 500 kW.
A century of rapid changes
The twentieth century witnessed rapid innovations and changes in hydropower facility design.
Policies enacted by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, including the New Deal in the 1930s, supported the construction of several multipurpose projects such as the Hoover and Grand Coulee dams with hydropower accounting for 40 per cent of the country’s electricity generation by 1940. [1][2]
From the 1940s to 1970s, spurred initially by World War II followed by strong post-war economic and population growth, state-owned utilities built significant hydropower developments throughout Western Europe, as well as the Soviet Union, North America and Japan.[3]
Low-cost hydropower was seen as one of the best ways to meet growing energy demand and was often tied to the development of energy-intensive industries such as aluminium smelters and steelworks.
Over the last decades of the twentieth century, Brazil and China became world leaders in hydropower. The Itaipu Dam, straddling Brazil and Paraguay, opened in 1984 with a capacity of 12,600 MW - it has since been enlarged and upgraded to 14,000 MW - and is today only eclipsed in size by the 22,500 MW Three Gorges Dam in China.
Decadal capacity growth stagnated in the late 1980s before falling in the 1990s. This was due to increasing financial constraints and concerns expressed about the environmental and social impacts of hydropower development, which halted many projects around the world.[4]
Lending and other forms of support from international financial institutions (IFIs), most notably the World Bank, dried up in the late 1990s, which particularly affected hydropower construction in the developing world.
Increased focus on sustainability
Towards the end of the century, during which global understanding increased on environmental and social impacts, there was a process of reassessing hydropower’s value and role in national development. In 2000, a landmark report published by the World Commission on Dams (WCD) challenged existing practices and initiated a change in the planning and development of hydropower towards a focus on sustainability and affected communities.[5][6]
The International Hydropower Association (IHA), formed under the auspices of UNESCO in 1995, began work on the IHA Sustainability Guidelines in 2004, which took into account the WCD Strategic Priorities, as well as World Bank Safeguard Policies, International Finance Corporation Performance Standards, and the Equator Principles. These guidelines led to the development of the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol (HSAP), a multi-stakeholder tool for assessing projects at all phases of their lifecycle.
These developments led to a fundamental shift in how best to plan, develop and operate hydropower projects, and resulted in a growing appreciation of the technology’s role in combatting climate change, reducing poverty and boosting prosperity.
A new era for hydropower
Not long after the turn of the twenty-first century, hydropower development gained a renewed momentum, particularly across Asia and South America.
Between 2000 and 2017, nearly 500 GW in hydropower installed capacity was added worldwide, representing an increase of 65 per cent, with growth since 2010 already outstripping that recorded in the first decade of the century.
The significant rise in installed capacity and generation from hydropower has been driven by a variety of often interrelated factors, notably:
Demand for energy in emerging economies
Developing countries, including Brazil and China, needed an affordable, reliable and a sustainable source of electricity to support rapid economic growth.Since 2000, China has more than quadrupled its installed capacity to 341 GW (2017), accounting for over half of the world’s hydropower capacity growth.
South-to-South investment and trade
The boom in South-to-South investment and trade (between developing countries) has become a critical source of hydropower financing and technology transfer. From 2004 to 2012, South-to-South trade in hydropower products and equipment increased from below 10 per cent of total global trade to nearly 50 per cent.
National development banks and private investors from emerging economies such as China, Brazil and Thailand have become major contributors to foreign direct investment (FDI), which in the past was largely provided by international development agencies and multilateral development banks.
As part of the Chinese government’s ‘Going Out’ strategy and its Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese companies and banks invested nearly USD 25 billion in projects overseas between 2000 and 2016 and in the process have become world leaders in hydropower development.
Multilateral agreements and goals
The past decade has seen greater recognition of hydropower’s role in achieving internationally agreed development outcomes, such as through the Sustainable Development Goals and climate goals including the Paris Agreement which have influenced national policy targets. Small hydropower projects (under 20 MW) in particular have benefited from the Clean Development Mechanism which was introduced under the Kyoto Protocol, the precursor to the Paris Agreement, to encourage clean and sustainable development.  
Support from the World Bank and IFIs
Lending from the World Bank for hydropower development increased from a few million dollars in 1999 to nearly USD 2 billion in 2014.The World Bank also extended its role from a ‘primary investor’ to an important ‘convenor’ that provides assistance in technical knowledge and bringing other financiers to the table.While the monetary value of the World Bank’s lending is a small fraction of the total amount invested in the sector each year, the bank’s recommitment to hydropower, along with other IFIs including the Asian Development Bank encouraged greater private sector investment and engagement.
The future
Due to its multiple services and benefits, hydropower is expected to remain the world’s largest source of renewable electricity for years to come and with significant untapped hydropower potential; much of the sector’s future growth is expected to come from Africa and Asia.  
In 2018, IHA, in its annual Hydropower Status Report, reported worldwide hydropower installed capacity to have risen to 1,267 GW, with a record 4,185 TWh estimated to have been generated in 2017.
According to the International Energy Agency, in order to meet the main energy-related components of the Sustainable Development Goals, including the below two degrees Celsius commitment of the Paris Agreement, an estimated 800 GW of additional hydropower will need to be brought online over the next two decades.

HYDROELECTRIC SAUNA
Renowned as one of the country's most unique saunas, our sauna not only provides the option of wet or dry warmth but also a clean, cool basin of water immediately within. Guests need not step out to cool down. The cool water is among the cleanest onsite, coming from what used to be the Silver Dollar pond and previously provided drinking water for the Village. A heated changing room allows a comfortable transition into the sauna and nice place to keep robes, towels, and footwear warm and cozy while swimming or in the sauna. The sauna temperature regulates between 130°F and 160°F when steamed. In the spirit of sustainable energy, our sauna is powered entirely from our on-site hydroelectric power plant.

Before BIGGS, Chief Judge, and GOODRICH and O'CONNELL, Circuit Judges.
BIGGS, Chief Judge.
For the second time Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation seeks to review in this court an order of the Federal Power Commission which will reduce the rates which it may charge for electric energy transmitted in interstate commerce. In the instant case the Federal Commission ruled that it possessed the power to regulate Safe Harbor's rates under Section 20, Part I, and also under Sections 205 and 206, Part II of the Federal Power Act and ordered a substantial rate reduction.
The first order was filed by the Federal Commission on June 11, 1940 and was set aside by the order of this court. See 124 F.2d 800. The order in the instant case was filed November 4, 1946. The Commission denied rehearing by an order issued December 24, 1946 and in the order denying rehearing made certain changes in its opinion which need not be discussed.
The 1935 Federal Power Act, 49 Stat. 863, 16 U.S.C.A. § 791(a) et seq., Part I of which is the 1920 Federal Water Power Act, as amended 41 Stat. 1063-1077, 41 Stat. 1353, 46 Stat. 797.
The circumstances of Safe Harbor's operations are referred to in our earlier opinion, 3 Cir., 124 F.2d 800, certiorari denied 316 U.S. 663, 62 S.Ct. 943, 86 L.Ed. 1740, and need not be detailed here. It will be necessary to read that opinion in conjunction with this. We think it is sufficient presently to state that we held in our earlier opinion that the Commission was without jurisdiction to regulate Safe Harbor's rates under Section 20, Part I of the Federal Power Act, because it had not found that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland were unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the rates to be charged by Safe Harbor for the sale of the electric energy generated and transmitted by it in interstate commerce wholesale. The Commission had not relied upon Part II of the Federal Power Act in its earlier proceedings and the provisions of that Part were not before us. We now hold that the Federal Commission possesses the power to regulate Safe Harbor's rates under the provisions of Part II of the Federal Power Act and that the Commission in making the regulatory order of November 4, 1946, employed a rate base formula authorized by the Federal Power Act and has allowed Safe Harbor a fair rate of return.
I. Applicable Statutory Provisions and Jurisdiction.

Did the Federal Commission have jurisdiction under Part II of the Federal Power Act to regulate Safe Harbor's rates and is Section 20, Part I, inconsistent with or repealed by implication by Part II? Repeals by implication are not favored. United States v. Jackson, 302 U.S. 628, 631, 58 S.Ct. 390, 82 L.Ed. 488; United States v. Borden Company, 308 U.S. 188, 198, 60 S.Ct. 182, 84 L.Ed. 181. Safe Harbor holds a fifty year license issued by the Commission on April 22, 1930, under Section 4(e) of the Federal Water Power Act of 1920. The provisions of Parts II and III of the Federal Power Act did not become effective until August 26, 1935. Section 28 of the Federal Water Power Act, incorporated without change into the Federal Power Act as Section 28, Part I, provided that though the right to alter, amend or repeal the provisions of the Act was expressly reserved by Congress no alteration, amendment or repeal should affect any license issued under the Act or the rights of licensees thereunder. Section 20 of the Federal Water Power Act, incorporated without change as Section 20, Part I, of the Federal Power Act, provided ""That when said power or any part thereof shall enter into interstate or foreign commerce the rates charged and the service rendered by any such licensee, or by any subsidiary corporation, the stock of which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such licensee, or by any person, corporation, or association purchasing power from such licensee for sale and distribution or use in public service shall be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and just to the customer and all unreasonable discriminatory and unjust rates or services are hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful; and whenever any of the States directly concerned has not provided a commission or other authority to enforce the requirements of this section within such State or to regulate and control the amount and character of securities to be issued by any of such parties, or such States are unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the services to be rendered, or on the rates or charges of payment therefor, or on the amount or character of securities to be issued by any of said parties, jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the commission, upon complaint of any person aggrieved, upon the request of any State concerned, or upon its own initiative to enforce the provisions of this section, to regulate and control so much of the services rendered, and of the rates and charges of payment therefor as constitute interstate or foreign commerce and to regulate the issuance of securities by the parties included within this section, and securities issued by the licensee subject to such regulations shall be allowed only for the bona fide purpose of financing and conducting the business of such licensee.
41 Stat. 1065-1066.
By Title II of the Public Utility Act of 1935, approved August 26, 1935, 49 Stat. 838, 16 U.S.C.A. §§ 791a-825r, the original Federal Water Power Act was made Part I of the ""Federal Power Act"" and Parts II and III added to that Act. Part II vests in the Commission jurisdiction over the interstate transmission of electric energy and public utility companies engaged therein. Part III relates to such public utility companies and also to licensees and carries the administrative and procedural provisions of the Federal Power Act.
Section 28 of the Federal Power Act provides ""That the right to alter, amend, or repeal this Act is hereby expressly reserved; but no such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall affect any license theretofore issued under the provisions of this Act, or the rights of any licensee thereunder.""
""The administration of the provisions of this section, so far as applicable, shall be according to the procedure and practice in fixing and regulating the rates, charges, and practices of railroad companies as provided in the Act to regulate commerce, approved February 4, 1887, as amended, and that the parties subject to such regulation shall have the same rights of hearing, defense, and review as said companies in such cases.
""In any valuation of the property of any licensee hereunder for purposes of rate making, no value shall be claimed by the licensee or allowed by the commission for any project or projects under license in excess of the value or values prescribed in section 14 hereof for the purposes of purchase by the United States, but there shall be included the cost to such licensee of the construction of the lock or locks or other aids of navigation and all other capital expenditures required by the United States, and no value shall be claimed or allowed for the rights granted by the commission or by this Act.""
Emphasis added throughout this opinion except where otherwise noted.
Section 14 of the Federal Water Power Act with minor amendments became Section 14, Part I, of the Federal Power Act. It is set out in the footnote. Section 14, containing the so-called ""recapture"" provisions, Part I, relating only to licensees, refers to ""net investment"" as an element going to fix the recapture base of a hydroelectric property and provides that in any event the United States on recapture shall not pay more than the ""fair value"" of the property. Section 3(11) of the Federal Water Power Act, in effect reenacted as Section 3(13) of the Federal Power Act (albeit with amendments not pertinent here), provided originally and provides now that ""`net investment' in a project means the actual legitimate original cost thereof as defined and interpreted in the `classification of investment in road and equipment of steam roads, issue of 1914, Interstate Commerce Commission', plus similar costs of additions thereto and betterments thereof, minus the sum of the following items properly allocated thereto, if and to the extent that such items have been accumulated during the period of the license from earnings in excess of a fair return on such investment: (a) Unappropriated surplus, (b) aggregate credit balances of current depreciation accounts, and (c) aggregate appropriations of surplus or income held in amortization, sinking fund, or similar reserves, or expended for additions or betterments or used for the purposes for such reserves were created. * * *"" It is the contention of Safe Harbor, as will more particularly appear hereinafter, that since Section 20 refers to ""net investment"", the net investment of Safe Harbor must be determined in accordance with the formula of Section 3(13) set out immediately above. This, says Safe Harbor, the Federal Commission failed to do.
Section 14, Part I, provides:
""Upon not less than two years' notice in writing from the commission the United States shall have the right upon or after the expiration of any license to take over and thereafter to maintain and operate any project or projects as defined in section 3 hereof, and covered in whole or in part by the license, or the right to take over upon mutual agreement with the licensee all property owned and held by the licensee then valuable and serviceable in the development, transmission, or distribution of power and which is then dependent for its usefulness upon the continuance of the license, together with any lock or locks or other aids to navigation constructed at the expense of the licensee, upon the condition that before taking possession it shall pay the net investment of the licensee in the project or projects taken, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus such reasonable damages, if any, to property of the licensee valuable, serviceable, and dependent as above set forth but not taken, as may be caused by the severance therefrom of property taken, and shall assume all contracts entered into by the licensee with the approval of the commission. The net investment of the licensee in the project or projects so taken and the amount of such severance damages, if any, shall be determined by the Commission after notice and opportunity for hearing. Such net investment shall not include or be affected by the value of any lands, rights-of-way, or other property of the United States licensed by the Commission under this Act, by the license or by good will, going value, or prospective revenues; nor shall the values allowed for water rights, rights-of-way, lands, or interests in lands be in excess of the actual reasonable cost thereof at the time of acquisition by the licensee: Provided, That the right of the United States or any State or municipality to take over, maintain, and operate any project licensed under this Act at any time by condemnation proceedings upon payment of just compensation is hereby expressly reserved.""
The word ""recapture"" is employed by the Commission and by the parties albeit the taking over by the United States of hydroelectric projects under Section 14 would be in fact a first taking.
The foregoing gives us only part of the background of our problem. As we have stated Safe Harbor is a ""licensee"" under the Federal Water Power Act, now Part I of the Federal Power Act. But is it also a ""public utility"" under Part II? A ""public utility"" is defined in Section 201(e), Part II, as ""* * * any person who owns or operates facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this Part"". Section 201(b) in pertinent part describes such facilities as those employed for ""the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce * * *."" The Federal Commission has found on evidence which admits of no serious dispute, that Safe Harbor owns and operates the prescribed jurisdictional facilities. See 5 F.P.C. at pp. 226-229. See Jersey Central Federal Power Light Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 319 U.S. 61, 63 S.Ct. 953, 87 L.Ed. 1258. Section 201(c) provides that ""electric energy shall be held to be transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a State and consumed at any point outside thereof * * *."" Section 201(d) states that the term ""sale of electric energy at wholesale"" shall mean ""a sale of electric energy to any person for resale."" It cannot be disputed that Safe Harbor makes such jurisdictional sales and the Commission has so found on very adequate evidence.
As we pointed out in our earlier opinion, 124 F.2d at page 802, Safe Harbor's output is delivered to an integrated interstate electric system under the terms of the so-called ""1931 contract"", two-thirds of the energy being sold to the Maryland Company and the remaining one-third going to the Pennsylvania Company. The Commission has correctly stated, ""The sales are sales for resale"", 5 F.P.C. at p. 235. They constitute in fact wholesale sales in interstate commerce.
Safe Harbor then is not only a licensee under Part I but it is also a public utility under Part II of the Federal Power Act. Section 201(a), Part II, declares the congressional policy in respect to public utilities as follows: ""* * * the business of transmitting and selling electric energy for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest, and * * * Federal regulation of matters relating to generation to the extent provided in this Part and the Part next following and of that part of such business which consists of the transmission of electric energy, in interstate commerce * * * is necessary in the public interest, such Federal regulation, however, to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States.""
Section 205(a) provides that ""All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.""
Section 206(a) states, ""Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge, or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation, practice, or contract affecting such rate, charge, or classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order.""
Section 208(a) provides that ""The Commission may investigate and ascertain the actual legitimate cost of the property of every public utility, the depreciation therein, and, when found necessary for rate-making purposes, other facts which bear on the determination of such cost or depreciation, and the fair value of such property.""
The argument favoring repeal by implication, or, perhaps more accurately, the reasoning supporting the existence of such inconsistency between the regulatory provisions of Section 20, Part I, and Part II as to require the discarding of the former for the latter, runs as follows. Since Safe Harbor is a ""public utility"" it is regulable under Part II though it is also a ""licensee"" under Part I. The language of Part II, Sections 205, 206 and 208 therefore must be deemed to provide the sole regulatory formula. But the contra argument is said to require the conclusion that if a hydroelectric project is a ""licensee"" under Part I, as is Safe Harbor, it must be regulable under Section 20. If Section 20 be used it is asserted the unique ""net investment"" formula of Section 3(13) implemented by Section 14, the ""recapture"" section of Part I, must also be employed.
We use the words ""repeal by implication"" as a ""shorthand"" phrase in this opinion for the sake of brevity. Section 212 of the Public Utility Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 847, specifically provides that ""Sections 1 to 29, inclusive, of the Federal Water Power Act, as amended, shall constitute Part I of that Act * *."" Section 213, provides that ""The Federal Water Power Act, as amended, is further amended by adding thereto the following parts * * *."" There follow Parts II and III being specifically designated in Section 320 as the ""Federal Power Act"". Sections 13, 20 and 28 of the Federal Water Power Act were left unchanged by the Public Utility Act of 1935 and were merely constituted part of Part I of the Federal Power Act by Section 212 of that Act, and Section 3 (11), now 3 (13) of the Federal Power Act, and Section 14 of the Federal Water Power Act were amended in respects not material here by the Public Utility Act of 1935. Perhaps, therefore, the term ""repeal by implication"" is not entirely appropriate. It would seem to be more accurate to state that certain portions of Parts I and II are inconsistent with each other unless, we, or some other court, find a rational reconciliation as we think we have done. If the provisions of the respective Acts cannot be reconciled then the former must be deemed to be repealed by the latter. Cf. our earlier opinion, 124 F.2d at pages 803-804. We held that Section 313(b) vesting the power to review decisions of the Federal Commission in the respective Courts of Appeals were so inconsistent with those of Section 20 which were deemed to provide for the review of such an order by a three-judge district court under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, Sections 41 (subdivision 28), 43-48, of former Title 28, as to require the conclusion that the later enactment repealed the earlier by necessary implication. We then, as now, were faced with the duty of reconciling apparently inconsistent provisions of the Federal Power Act. The question as to which tribunal shall review an order of the Commission is very largely a procedural distinction and, as the Commission points out procedural changes may be effected without consent of the ""licensee"". Pennsylvania Power Light Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 3 Cir., 139 F.2d 445, certiorari denied 321 U.S. 798, 64 S.Ct. 938, 88 L.Ed. 1086.
We are aware that high authority takes an opposing view and asserts that the provisions of Section 20, Part I, are irreconcilable with those of Sections 201, 205 and 206, Part II, and that Section 20 has been repealed by implication. See for example, Benton, ""Jurisdiction of F.P.C. and State Agencies"", 14 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 78 (1945).
It is contended by Safe Harbor that this is so because the base for rate making or recapture is a single financial arrangement with the licensee. ""Net investment"", says Safe Harbor, must be the same element whether employed as a base to determine the rate of return or the amount to be paid on recapture. This was orally argued by counsel for Safe Harbor in the following terms: ""Congress determined that these two subjects of rate making and recapture were inseparably part of a single financial agreement with the licensee; and the reason for that is a very simple one — that the higher the rates, [sic] if the licensee gets excessive rates under the recapture formula of Section 14, it serves to reduce the recapture price, so that the two are naturally connected.""
Going on with Safe Harbor's argument, it contends that since Section 206, Part II, contains no such formula as that set out in Section 3(13), regulation under Section 206 must be on a different basis from that required by Section 20. Therefore Section 20 must prevail. The proponents of repeal by implication or fatal inconsistence assert that the provisions of the respective sections are incompatible and that one must give way to the other.
Sections 205, 206 and 208 are in fact a later statutory enactment than Section 20 but we do not find the argument in favor of repeal by implication persuasive. As we have seen, Sections 20 and 28 were simply constituted a part of the Federal Power Act by Section 212 of the Public Utility Act of 1935 and Section 213 of the latter Act states, ""The Federal Water Power Act, as amended, is further amended by adding thereto the following parts * * *""; then follow Parts II and III of the Federal Power Act. But Section 3(11), now Section 3(13) of the Federal Power Act, and Section 14 of the Federal Water Power Act were reenacted by the Public Utility Act of 1935 albeit amended in parts not pertinent here. See note 10, supra. It can be argued with some plausibility therefore that since Safe Harbor is a ""licensee"" it must be regulated as such even though it is also a ""public utility"". But under the view which we take it is not necessary to resolve these questions for we are of the opinion that the provisions of Section 20, Part I, and those of Sections 205, 206 and 208, Part II, are not conflicting or inconsistent.
Our reasons are as follows: First, we point out that the regulatory language contained in Section 20 is substantially identical in effect, the provisions of Section 3(13) aside, with that of Section 206. Second, Section 20 expressly provides that in the valuation of the property of any licensee for purposes of rate making ""* * * no value shall be claimed by the licensee or allowed by the commission for any project * * * under license in excess of the value * * * prescribed in section 14 hereof for the purposes of purchase by the United States * * *"". In other words the reference to Section 14 and via Section 14 to the ""net investment"" provision of Section 3(13) provides a limit for valuation and cannot be construed as a grant of power to make a valuation. Third, it will be observed that if regulation of rates be had under Section 20 of Part I that such regulation conceivably may be by State commissions, whereas recapture must always be by the United States. The United States on exercising its recapture powers under Section 14 at the end of the license period will be required to pay the ""net investment"" of the licensee in the project taken but ""not to exceed the fair value of the property taken."" ""Net investment"" therefore may exceed ""fair value"". ""Net investment"" may be determined by State commissions but ""fair value"" must be determined by the United States and the two elements need not be the same though they should coincide. If State commissions, for example, should allow too high a ""net investment"", applying the Section 3(13) formula, the United States would not be bound by such a determination though the figures have been set throughout the entire operative period of the license. The United States on recapture would pay merely ""fair value"". Moreover, the argument of Safe Harbor, both on its brief and as made orally, the latter being quoted at an earlier point in this opinion, that the subjects of rate making and recapture are ""inseparably part of a single financial agreement with the licensee"" will not hold water. As we endeavor to point out under ""II"" of this opinion, dealing with rate base, ""net investment"" as conceived of by Safe Harbor under the Section 3(13) formula must inevitably result in a rate in excess of a ""fair return"". This is so because under the view taken by Safe Harbor depreciation is not deducted from rate base. We conclude, and we elucidate our reasons at a later point hereinafter, that if Congress intended such a result it would have made that intention manifest in unmistakable terms in the language of Section 20 and would not have used the ""in excess"" phrase relating to value as prescribed in Section 14. Section 28 does not require a different conclusion. That section does not confer upon the licensee a right to an excessive rate of return or sustain a charge that the Commission in the instant case has in effect changed the rules relating to ascertainment of rate base in the middle of the game. The present pertinent provisions of Section 20 have remained unchanged since 1920. Fourth and last, while Safe Harbor lays great emphasis upon the last clause of Section 201(a) which provides that federal regulation is ""* * * to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States."", this language is not pertinent in the instant controversy for it is designed to be applicable only to electric energy transmitted and sold in intrastate commerce. The control of rates referred to in the section is control by a single State and the language has no relation to possible joint control by two or more States under the compact clause of the Constitution.
Section 20 provides that the sale and distribution or use of electric energy ""* * * shall be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and just to the customer * * *"", Section 206 provides that the rate or charge for electric energy if ""* * unjust, unreasonable, [or] unduly discriminatory * * *"" is subject to regulation by the Commission.
Cf. Public Utilities Comm. of Rhode Island v. Attleboro Steam and Electric Co., 273 U.S. 83, 47 S.Ct. 294, 71 L.Ed. 549, See Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., 252 U.S. 23, 40 S.Ct. 279, 64 L.Ed. 434, and Connecticut Light Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 324 U.S. 515.
We are of the opinion that the view which we have expressed is not in violation of the Fifth Amendment. It is our duty to reconcile the provisions of the Federal Power Act with those of the Constitution of the United States and we think that our solution works a reconciliation of Safe Harbor's franchise, the Federal Power Act and the Constitution.
We shall presently hold, as appears from heading ""I.B."" of this opinion, that the Federal Commission has properly found that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland have been unable to agree on cooperative regulation of Safe Harbor's rates. Conceding that regulation under Part I, whether conducted by the Federal Commission or State Commission, is identical in scope and that the Federal Commission cannot regulate electric energy which the States cannot regulate under the compact clause, clause 3 of Section 10 of Article I of the Constitution, nonetheless, since regulation under Section 20 sans the ""net investment"" base of Section 3(13) is or should be substantially identical with regulation by the Federal Commission under Section 206 because of the similarity of regulatory language of Sections 20 and 206, it seems only an academic question whether regulation be conducted by the Federal Commission to require that the sale and distribution or use of electric energy ""* * * shall be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and just to the customer"" (Section 20) or by the Federal Commission in such way that the rate or charge for electric energy may be regulated if it is ""* * * unjust, unreasonable [or] unduly discriminatory"". If, as we have held, the provisions of Section 206 properly are to be read in the light of Section 20 in fact making the provisions of Section 20 ( sans the ""net investment"" language of Section 3(13)), the equivalent of those of Section 206, the rights of Safe Harbor as a licensee are preserved, the requirements of Section 28 are met and regulation of Safe Harbor's rates may proceed upon such a fair and equitable basis as the Federal Commission may determine. See Federal Power Comm. v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333. In other words we read Section 206 as if the provisions of Section 20 were a part of it.
The word ""customer"" is not defined in Part I and though it may possess some connotation of a small local consumer who uses electricity in his home, giving the phrase its ordinary meaning it is certainly broad enough to include the Pennsylvania Company or the Maryland Company to which Safe Harbor's electric energy is dispensed.
See the definition of the word ""customer"", Webster's New International Dictionary, 3rd Edition.
We appreciate the fact that our construction of the provisions of Section 20 is at variance with the dicta of two courts. See Niagara Falls Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 787, 792-793, certiorari denied 320 U.S. 792, 64 S.Ct. 206, 88 L.Ed. 477, and Alabama Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 75 U.S.App. D.C. 315, 128 F.2d 280, 293, certiorari denied 317 U.S. 652, 63 S.Ct. 48, 87 L.Ed. 525. Our first opinion squints in the same direction. But as Judge Learned Hand stated in the Niagara Falls Power Company case, 137 F.2d at page 795, in construing the Federal Power Act, ""* * * it is necessary * * * to break through the band of verbal logic at its weakest spot. * * *"" Cf. Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 3 Cir., 169 F.2d 719, 723. The ""fair value of the property"" provision of Section 14, however, will supply an upward limit and whatever may be found to be the Section 3(13) ""net investment"" base the property can be recaptured by the United States at its ""fair value"". We are faced with the practical task of construing Acts of Congress. We can perceive no grave dichotomy in using the provisions of Section 3(13) for recapture and not employing them in arriving at a rate base.
We point out that Safe Harbor's license casts but little light on the problem of rate regulation. An examination of the license and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission tend to support the Commission, or at least, serve to show that the Commission's general conception of its rate-making power has been consistent. Article 1 of the license provides that the project ""* * * shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this license, including the terms and conditions of the Act and of the rules and regulations of the Commission pursuant thereto and made a part of this license"". Article 26 provides that the licensee shall abide by such reasonable regulation of services and rates as are prescribed by state agencies or by the Federal Commission when it has jurisdiction. Article 23 contains language somewhat like that of Section 3(13), Part I, of the Federal Power Act but that article deals with amortization as required under Section 10(d) of the Federal Power Act. Regulation 17 (Section 2D) of the rules and regulations of the Commission makes it clear that the determination of net investment and rate of return for purposes of amortization shall not be construed as limiting rate-making proceedings. This regulation is specifically referred to in Article 23 of the license. We do not assert that amortization and depreciation are the same coin. But no other article is even remotely analogous here. Since the license contains no limitations on rate-making authorities not to be found in the Federal Power Act itself, we need not concern ourselves further with the provisions of the license.
B. Was the Federal Commission entitled to regulate Safe Harbor under Part I of the Federal Power Act? Because of our rulings under heading ""I.A."" of this opinion this question has become academic. We think we should resolve it, however, because the reviewing Court may take a view of the substantive law which differs from our own. Under heading ""I.A."" we held that regulation of rates under Section 20 was substantially the same as regulation under Section 206 and that regulation under Section 206, because Safe Harbor is a licensee under Section 4, must be exercised with due regard to the provisions of Section 20. In our earlier opinion we held that the Federal Commission was without jurisdiction to regulate Safe Harbor's rates as provided in its earlier order because it had failed to make a finding that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland were ""* * * unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the services to be rendered, or on the rates or charges of payment therefor * * *"". Our actual ruling went no further than this. See 124 F.2d at pages 805-809. Certiorari was denied on April 6, 1942, 316 U.S. 663, 62 S.Ct. 943, 86 L.Ed. 1740. For more than two years the Federal Commission took no steps and nothing was accomplished by either the Pennsylvania or the Maryland Commissions.
Order of June 11, 1940.
On May 23, 1944, the Public Service Commission of Maryland began an investigation of rates charged by the Maryland Company. Hearings commenced on June 6, 1944. While this investigation was going on, viz., on June 27, 1944, the People's Counsel acting for the Maryland Commission, Counsel for the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and certain other parties who need not be enumerated filed a petition with the Maryland Commission asserting that the wholesale rates paid by the Maryland Company to Safe Harbor were unreasonably high, and requested the Maryland Commission to ask the Federal Power Commission to determine the reasonableness of Safe Harbor's rates.
Subsequently, on August 12, 1944 these parties wrote to the Federal Power Commission requesting that the ""* * * Commission itself determine these rates and if practicable afford relief by interim orders."" The letter is set forth in pertinent part below. Thereafter on August 30, 1944, the Chairman of the Maryland Commission wrote to the Federal Commission and requested it to proceed to determine the rates to be charged by Safe Harbor. The letter in pertinent part is set forth below. The Maryland Commission, by its Chairman, stated in this letter that public demanded the regulatory procedure which would ""get results in the shortest possible time"" and that while the Commissions of both Maryland and Pennsylvania were ""ready to engage in cooperative regulation"" in accordance with the opinion of this court, the Maryland Commission understood that the Federal Commission was ""prepared to pursue the matter to a conclusion in much less time than probably would be required by state action"". On September 1, 1944, the day following the receipt of the Maryland Commission's letter, the Federal Commission issued its order instituting the investigation of Safe Harbor's wholesale rates. The Federal Commission based its action ""* * * upon consideration of the petition filed on August 31, 1944 by the Maryland Commission * * *"" and the ""joint petition"" filed August 14, 1944, by the intervenors in the Maryland proceeding previously referred to but made no finding that the Maryland Commission and Pennsylvania Commission had been unable to agree on regulation.

""Docket No. IT-5914 Hon. Basil Manly Acting Chairman — Federal Power Commission
Dear Commissioner Manly:
The undersigned are counsel for certain intervenors in an investigation now pending before the Maryland Public Service Commission of the rates for electric service charged by the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore. The purpose of this letter is to request your Commission to determine, at the earliest convenient date, the just and reasonable wholesale rates charged for electric energy which is sold to the Consolidated Company in interstate commerce by two hydro-electric companies whose plants are located in the State of Pennsylvania, namely, Pennsylvania Water and Power Company and Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation. * * *
The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, a municipal corporation of Maryland, is interested in the rates charged by the river companies in two respects and capacities. First, it is one of the largest single consumers of gas and electric energy supplied by the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore in connection with the lighting of its streets and public buildings. Second, it is deeply concerned with the rates charged to other ratepayers in Baltimore City by that company. Baltimore County has a similar concern with regard to its own consumption and that of its residents.
The investigation here has proceeded to a point where it has become apparent that the rates of the Consolidated Company cannot be effectively determined unless determinations are also made of the just and reasonable wholesale rates at which this Company purchases energy in interstate commerce from the two hydroelectric companies. It also appears that the wholesale rates of these two companies, which have never been regulated, are grossly excessive * * * we beg to call your attention to the fact that in case known as Docket IT 5494, decided June 11, 1940, the Federal Power Commission found the rates of Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation to be excessive. Yet, notwithstanding the considerable time which has elapsed since this finding was made, the ratepayers affected, including the undersigned, have obtained no relief.
On June 27, 1944, People's Counsel for the State of Maryland, an official appointed by the Governor and charged by statute with the duty of representing the interest of the public in cases involving the rates and practices of public utility corporations, formally petitioned the Maryland Public Service Commission to request your Commission to make the rate determination here requested. The undersigned joined in that application. While no order has been passed upon those petitions, we understand informally that joint hearings with regard to these rates are contemplated by the Maryland and Pennsylvania commissions. * * *
In view of the clearer jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission and its superior facilities for making these determinations, we respectfully request that the Federal Power Commission itself determine these rates and if practicable afford relief by interim orders.

Honorable Basil Manly, Acting Chairman, Federal Power Commission,
Dear Mr. Chairman:
As you know, this Commission is engaged in an investigation of the rates charged by Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore which receives large quantities of electric energy from Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation and Pennsylvania Water and Power Company.
In considering a motion by People's Counsel, that this Commission request the Federal Power Commission to determine the reasonable rates to be charged by these two companies for energy supplied to Maryland, we have first inquired into the preparedness of the two state commissions to exercise the regulation indicated by U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation v. Federal Power Commission.
While the state commissions are ready to engage in cooperative regulation and the opinion of the Circuit Court indicates state jurisdiction, the public interest demands the procedure which will get results in the shortest possible time and we understand that the Federal Power Commission is prepared to pursue the matter to a conclusion in much less time than probably would be required by state action.
Under the circumstances, this Commission has decided to grant the motion of People's Counsel and hereby requests that the Federal Power Commission proceed to determine the reasonable rates to be charged by Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation and by Pennsylvania Water and Power Company for energy sold to Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore. * * *
Very truly yours, /s/ Steuart Purcell, Chairman.""
The phrase ""joint petition"" was used by the Federal Commission in its order of September 1, 1944 to designate the letter set out in note 15, supra.
Extensive hearings were held. These culminated in the present opinion of the Commission and its order of November 4, 1946, here under review. As we have stated there was no finding by the Federal Commission of jurisdiction over Safe Harbor at the time its order instituting the rate investigation was issued but such a finding was made by the Commission in its opinion. In its opinion in the instant case as we have stated the Commission found that it had jurisdiction to regulate Safe Harbor's wholesale rates both under Section 20, Part I, because the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland had been unable to agree on regulation, and under Part II because electric energy created by Safe Harbor was dispensed by the prescribed jurisdictional facilities in interstate wholesale rates. We agree that the Commission may regulate Safe Harbor's rates but on the theory expressed in ""I.A."", supra.
Commissioner Draper dissenting.
The Act, as the Commission points out in its opinion, must be given a reasonable construction and one which will carry out the purpose of Congress to assure adequate and effective regulation of wholesale rates for electric energy in interstate commerce. The Commission stated, 5 F.P.C. at pp. 232-233, that if such rates continue to be too high ""inaction by the States involved, after reasonable opportunity [to cooperate in regulation] may show that they are unable to agree as certainly as formal announcement of the fact"". The Commission in its earlier opinion of June 11, 1940, 2 F.P.C. 182, had found that the 7% rate of return assured to Safe Harbor under its contract with the Pennsylvania Company was unreasonable. This finding was of course contested by Safe Harbor. As appears at a later point in this opinion under heading ""III"", this court, like the Federal Commission, is also of the opinion that the rates charged by Safe Harbor are too high. We can perceive no reason why the Commission's finding that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland are unable to cooperate for the purposes of regulation as provided by Section 20 may not properly be bottomed on a long continued failure of States to cooperate.
It will be borne in mind that the Pennsylvania Company sells the electric energy which it purchases to the Maryland Company and to others at wholesale.
But aside from the foregoing, failure to cooperate under the compact clause certainly requires no more formality than cooperation under that clause. Cf. 124 F.2d at page 808. The compact clause does not require the States to embark upon a course of good faith bargaining as is required of the parties to a labor dispute under the National Labor Relations Act. 29 U.S.C.A. § 151 et seq. Refusal of a State to cooperate with another State under Section 20 may be for a good reason or for no reason at all. While the Maryland Commission in some of the correspondence set out in the antecedent footnotes as given lip service to the conception that it and the Pennsylvania Commission might engage in cooperative regulation, the Maryland Commission's letter of August 30, 1944, makes it clear that it had and has no intention of proceeding to cooperate with the Pennsylvania Commission to endeavor to regulate Safe Harbor's rates. Not infrequently that which may be read between the lines of a letter is more potent in carrying conviction than the written words themselves, and in the light of all which transpired before the Federal Commission made the regulatory order presently under review we have no doubt that the Maryland Commission did not wish to cooperate with the Pennsylvania Commission in respect to Safe Harbor's rates. It should be noted, however, that the Pennsylvania Commission has consistently taken the position that it is ready to cooperate with the Maryland Commission.
In addition to the foregoing the Maryland Commission's brief filed in this court states that that consideration of the factors referred to in the brief, which in substance are those set out in the Commission's letters ""* * * impelled the decision by the Maryland Commission that it would be impossible for it to join in cooperative regulation with the Pennsylvania Commission"". While this statement quoted in full in note 20, supra, was, of course, not before the Federal Commission when it held on November 4, 1946 that Maryland and Pennsylvania were unable to agree on regulation under Section 20, and therefore perhaps the statement may not properly serve as a statement to the Commission of a jurisdictional fact, the statements in the brief fortify the conclusion which both the Federal Commission and this court have reached. Moreover, it will be observed that in the sentence italicized in note 20, supra, and referred to in the beginning of this paragraph, the past tense of the verb ""impel"" is used and seems to reflect the long continued state of mind of the Maryland Commission. It would be a futile thing to set aside the proceeding of the Federal Commission simply because that tribunal did not have before it the conclusive statements now in the brief of the Maryland Commission. To do so would be to invalidate the proceedings of the Federal Commission for the sake of date on the calendar.
See pp. 8-9 of the Maryland Commission's brief which state as follows:
""Negotiations with the Pennsylvania Commission looking toward a cooperative procedure were instituted by the Maryland Commission. But little of a tangible nature was accomplished. The interests of Maryland and Pennsylvania were in conflict. The Maryland Commission had no assurance that its role in determining reasonable rates for Safe Harbor would be controlling or even persuasive under such procedure. There were no precedents of cooperation on rate regulation between the two Commissions or elsewhere to afford a guide. Furthermore the Maryland Commission is small, and it felt that it could not carry on its other responsibilities and effectively participate in such an extended joint investigation as would be required. In addition, the Maryland Commission's General Counsel, after consultation with Judge Benton, then counsel to the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, raised grave doubts as to the legality of the procedure. In the meantime, People's Counsel and certain intervenors before the Maryland Commission, as above referred to, had directly petitioned the Federal Power Commission to institute an investigation. Consideration of these factors impelled the decision by the Maryland Commission that it would be impossible for it to join in cooperative regulation with the Pennsylvania Commission. Accordingly Maryland Commission requested action by the Federal Power Commission.""
The Maryland Commission's brief was filed in this court on March 14, 1949.
In view of the foregoing we have no doubt that the Federal Commission may undertake the regulation of Safe Harbor's rates under Section 20, Part I, to the same extent that the Pennsylvania and Maryland Commissions could have done under the compact clause.
II. Rate Base.
We come then to the questions presented by the instant review which are considered seriatim in the letter headings set out under this portion of the opinion.
A. Has the Federal Commission properly applied the formula of Section 20, Part I of the Act as the provisions of that Section are made applicable by Part II, Sections 205, 206 and 208? The order of the Federal Commission reduces Safe Harbor's rates by about $630,000 a year setting the corporation's fair return at 5%. Safe Harbor as we have indicated insists that the formula of Section 20 must be read in the light of the provisions of Section 3 (13) relating to ""net investment"" and in conformity with those of Section 14, the recapture section of Part I. It must be borne in mind, however, that the Commission asserts that it is entitled to regulate Safe Harbor's rates under both Part I and Part II. In view of the fact that we are of the opinion that the provisions of Section 3(13) are not binding on the Commission in establishing a rate base and that the rate regulatory provisions of Section 206, substantially the same as those of Section 20, must be read into Section 20, the divergence in our view of the law from that of the Commission in this connection is too small to be a matter of substance.
We have already passed in this opinion on the legal application of the sections of the Federal Power Act which Safe Harbor and the Commission have contended are involved but we have not discussed as yet the contentions of the parties relating specifically to depreciation and rate base. Safe Harbor has insisted that ""net investment"" as set out in Section 3(13) must be applied in order to arrive at a rate base under Section 20, relying, as we have said, on that portion of Section 3(13) which provides as follows: ""`net investment' in a project means the actual legitimate original cost thereof as defined and interpreted in the `classification of investment in road and equipment of steam roads, issue of 1914, Interstate Commerce Commission', plus similar cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof, minus the sum of the following items properly allocated thereto, if and to the extent that such items have been accumulated during the period of the license from earnings in excess of a fair return on such investment: * * * (b) aggregate credit balances of current depreciation accounts * * *."" It is reasonably clear from the Commission's opinion that it has attempted to apply the provisions of Section 3(13) though it insists that the statute does not compel it to do so since it can, it says, regulate under Section 206. It is apparent that the Commission has applied correctly the provisions of Section 206, Part II, in arriving at the same rate base. See 5 F.P.C. at pp. 243-247, and also the findings of the Commission 1 to 15 inclusive, 5 F.P.C. 265-268, and findings 19 and 20, id. at p. 269. In other words, the Commission has worked with both hands endeavoring, we think, to apply the provisions of Section 20 in the light of Section 3(13) and also those of Section 206. We think we state the Commission's position correctly when we say that the Commission held in effect that any depreciation taken in a year when there was a fair return on the investment was in fact depreciation taken ""in excess of a fair return"".
An example, however oversimplified, may prove helpful. Assume that the ""actual legitimate investment"" of X Company was $1,000,000 in the first year of its operations, a year which we will designate as 1940. Presume further that $110,000 remained from X Company's income after all operating expenses and taxes were paid and that $50,000 represented the depreciation of assets on the company's books. For the purposes of our example let us take 6% or $60,000 as a ""fair return"" to X Company. $60,000 would then be a reasonable return on the company's $1,000,000 investment. The $50,000 depreciation, however would be held by the Commission under the view expressed in its present opinion (see 5 F.P.C. at pp. 265-268) to be in excess of a fair return and would be deductible in determining the ""net investment"" to be employed for ascertaining the rate base in the next fiscal year, 1941. In other words, in the fiscal year 1941 the ""net investment"" of X Company would be $950,000. If the depreciation remained at the same figure, $50,000 and $110,000 again remained from the Company's income after operating expenses and taxes had been paid in the year 1941, and assuming again that 6% represented a fair return, it would follow that $57,000, not $60,000, would be a reasonable return to X Company. At the end of a period which could be estimated, presuming that no additions to equipment were made by X Company, the rate base would dwindle to zero as the depreciation account mounted. This seems to be the theory under which the Commission sought to apply the provisions of Section 20 in conjunction with those of Section 3(13) in the instant case.
If, however, still taking the example of X Company, we assume a fair return to be $60,000 for the fiscal year 1940 and depreciation at the same figure, viz., $50,000 and net income after deduction of operating expenses and taxes to be $100,000, we see that the funds are insufficient for a fair return and proper depreciation. In such a case the Commission would have to concede that depreciation accounts would be deducted from the rate base only ""to the extent"" that they are in excess of a fair return. Since in this example $60,000 is the fair return, only $40,000 would be deductible from the rate base. Safe Harbor, as we analyze its position, seems in fact to contend that depreciation should never be deducted from the rate base. This may be criticized as an oversimplification but it is the practical result of Safe Harbor's position.
Safe Harbor, however, if we apply what we understand to be its contentions to the instant example, takes the position that if the ""actual legitimate investment"" were $1,000,000 and $50,000 represented depreciation at the end of 1940, $110,000 remaining of the Company's income after operating expenses and taxes were paid, the $50,000 depreciation should first be deducted from the $110,000 and that the difference between the two amounts, representing net income and depreciation, viz., $60,000, would represent the fair return on X Company's $1,000,000 net investment. Therefore, says Safe Harbor, nothing should be deducted from the $1,000,000; that is to say, X Company should go into the next fiscal year, 1941, with a ""net investment"" of $1,000,000.
Changing the example slightly let us suppose that the ""actual legitimate investment"" in X Company was still $1,000,000, that $110,000 again remained after operating expenses and taxes had been paid; and $50,000 continued to be the figure properly deducted from the $110,000 for depreciation. Assume further that for the year in question 5% rather than 6% was a fair return on the $1,000,000. This would mean that only $50,000 could be properly allocated to profits or return for that year instead of $60,000. The $10,000 of $110,000 which was left over after normal depreciation and fair return would represent a sort of surplus but one not legitimately available for X Company's profit account since X Company already had earned a ""fair return"". If this $10,000 were allocated to the Company's depreciation account, the figure would represent ""depreciation in excess of a fair return"" under Section 3(13). Even Safe Harbor admits that this $10,000 would be deducted from the rate base, but it insists that only such a surplus depreciation could be deducted under Section 3(13).
The foregoing examples set out we think the conflicting views of the Commission and of Safe Harbor in what each deems to be the proper application of the provisions of Section 3(13) under the circumstances of the instant case. It is not necessary to resolve the conflict, however, for in our opinion, as we have stated, the Commission is not required to apply the Section 3(13) formula in order to arrive at a rate base.
We come now to the actual figures involved in the instant case. The Commission properly has employed the year 1943 as a typical year and has made the following statement of Safe Harbor's rate base:
""Actual legitimate investment $30,141,176 Reserve for depreciation 1,575,674 ____________ Net investment 28,565,502 Working capital 220,000 ____________ Rate base, 1943 28,785,502.""
We designate this statement for the sake of convenience as the ""Rate Base Statement"".
It is Safe Harbor's position, as we understand it, that its ""net investment"" under Section 3(13), is the actual legitimate original cost of its project, viz., $30,141,176, as shown in the first column above, without any deduction therefrom. Safe Harbor relies on the dictum of Judge Learned Hand in Niagara Falls Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d at page 792, in which it was stated that ""net investment"" is ""the base upon which the rates are to be calculated if it [the hydroelectric project] ever engages in interstate or foreign commerce, § 20 * * *"", and on a substantially similar statement in Mr. Justice Miller's opinion, in the Alabama Power Co. case, 128 F.2d at page 293, which declared that ""The formula for valuation of properties of licensees, for rate making purposes, is contained in the provisions of sections of the 1920 Act, which were incorporated into Part I of the Federal Power Act of 1935."" Safe Harbor seeks to rely on the language of Section 3(13) which we have quoted.
Safe Harbor points out that in that portion of the Commission's opinion and order dealing with rate reduction, finding that a 5% return on the rate base is a fair one, the Commission determined, again using the year 1943 as typical, that a rate reduction of $627,551, computed as below, would necessarily result:
""Operating Revenues .............. $3,620,412 Operating Revenue Deductions: Operating Expenses ............ 633,162 Depreciation .................. 504,100 Taxes, except Federal Income .. 143,110 Federal Income Tax ............ 273,214 Total Revenue Deductions .... 1,553,586 Net Operating Income .......... 2,066,826 __________ Return on Net Investment — 5% ......................... 1,439,275 __________ Excess Revenue ................ $ 627,551""
We will designate this statement for the sake of convenience as the ""Operating Revenues Statement"".
Safe Harbor shows, to use its own phrase, that the item ""earnings"" is computed in the foregoing calculation as the amount of the ""net operating income"", viz., $2,066,822, arrived at only after deducting the allowance for depreciation, viz., $504,100. Safe Harbor points out that the finding of ""excess earnings"" made by the Commission Finding (19), 5 F.P.C. at p. 269, is based on the present day correct conception of earnings, viz., that ""earnings"" are the amount remaining after deducting operating expenses, including taxes and depreciation and that there can be no return to the licensee until proper provision has been made out of revenues for depreciation. With this we agree. But Safe Harbor also contends that a basic inconsistency exists between the findings of the Commission in regard to ""excess earnings"", Finding (13) and its Findings (19) and (20) 5 F.P.C. at pp. 268-269, in that in the latter findings the Commission has determined the amount of ""excess earnings"" and ordered a reduction in rates which will eliminate them while in Finding (13) the Commission has declared that after such elimination the amount credited to the depreciation reserve, ""* * * will continue to be accumulated from earnings in excess of a fair rate"". As we understand the situation, however, one of the reasons for Finding (13) was that the Commission believed that it had to follow the Section 3(13) formula. Another reason why the Commission made Finding (13) lies in the fact that all of it save two sentences is a proper finding under Section 206. In other words Finding (13) seems to embrace the Commission's two theories of rate base finding; viz., rate base finding under its conception of rate base finding bottomed on Section 3(13) via Section 20 and also rate base finding under Section 206. The finding has a foot in both Parts I and II of the Act and for this reason is somewhat ambiguous. The same comment may be appropriately made in respect to Findings (10), (12) and (20). To reiterate, if the Commission had applied the provisions of Section 20, sans the interpolation of its construction of Section 3(13), Finding (13) would have been unassailable in all respects. The Commission attempted to apply and did clearly make use of the regulatory provisions of Section 206 which, as we have endeavored to show, contained no important variance in regulatory effect from those of Section 20 as we have construed it.
See p. 55 of Safe Harbor's brief in chief.
The figure of $504,100 is arrived at by the Commission by use of a ""straight line"" depreciation method. See 5 F.P.C. at pp. 545-557. The propriety of using a ""straight-line"" method of depreciation is discussed at a later point in this opinion and need not be presently gone into.
The two sentences read as follows:
""The recorded depreciation reserve has been accumulated from earnings in excess of a fair rate of return"", and ""Under the provisions of the order hereinafter prescribed, such depreciation reserve will continue to be accumulated from earnings in excess of a fair rate of return."" These sentences look to the Section 3 (13) formula which we believe the Commission has applied erroneously and which in our opinion it should not have sought to apply at all.
Findings (16) and (17) relate to methods of depreciation and ""service lives"" and are not germane to the issue which we are now discussing.""
Our problem then becomes one of dissection. Can those portions of Findings (1) to (4) inclusive, and of Findings (10), (12), (13) and (20) which the Commission directed to an interpretation of the regulatory provisions of Section 20 because of the interpolation of Section 3 (13) be excised from its 20 findings, leaving an adequate basis to sustain the order of the Commission on the regulatory provisions of Section 206 read in the light of Section 20 sans the provisions of Section 3(13)? We conclude that the Commission's findings and opinion are such that this result may be effected with due regard for the rights of Safe Harbor. The application by the Commission of the provisions of Section 206 seem to us to be clearly separable and capable of standing by themselves.
B. Has the Commission correctly applied the regulatory provisions of Section 206 in the light of Section 20? The Commission, using the year 1943 as typical, a course which is fully justified by the record, arrived at a figure of $30,141,176 as the ""Actual legitimate investment"" of Safe Harbor. See the ""Rate Base Statement"", note 23, supra. There is no dispute as to this figure. The Commission then took the depreciation reserve as recorded in Safe Harbor's books as of December 31, 1943 in the amount of $1,691,629.44 and for the purpose of determining a proper rate base for the year 1943, used as accrued depreciation the average amount recorded in Safe Harbor's depreciation reserve for that year which was $1,575,674. Deducting the figure last mentioned, the Commission then found a ""net investment"" of Safe Harbor for the year 1943 in the amount of $28,785,502.
What the Commission did was to use the customary and normal practice or technique of deducting depreciation in the course of arriving at a rate base. Such a course must be deemed to be proper in view of the principle enunciated in Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., supra, for it is an eminently reasonable and sensible one. It is true that the Commission designated the sum of $28,565,502, (net after deducting $1,575,674, ""Reserve for depreciation"", from $30,141,176, ""Actual legitimate investment"") as ""Net investment"" and the sum of $28,565,502 possibly should not have been so designated. The dispute here, however, is really one of terms, not of substance, for the phrase ""net investment"" as used in Section 3(13), Part I, is a term of art under the definition imposed by Section 3 (13). The Commission used a magic name which seems at first glance to canalize its finding solely to Section 3(13). But the fact remains that the figure of $28,565,502 validly describes Safe Harbor's position when a correct depreciation figure is deducted from the company's capital investment and may properly be employed in arriving at a rate base pursuant to the provisions of Section 206. The figure of depreciation employed by the Commission, viz., $1,575,674, is a reasonable one and the Commission has taken it from the books of Safe Harbor with what we deem to be proper safeguards. We can perceive no sound basis for further dispute in respect to this use of the item. To the amount of $28,565,502 the Commission has added the sum of $220,000 as working capital, an amount which concededly is proper. A rate base for the year 1943 of $28,785,502, is thus created.
Turning again to what we have hereinbefore designated as the ""Operating Revenues Statement"" it appears that the operating revenues of Safe Harbor for the year 1943 amounted to $3,620,412 and that the total of operating revenue deductions was $1,553,586, leaving a ""net operating income"" of $2,066,826. 5% on ""Net investment"" (.05 times $28,785,502, the rate base) amounts to $1,439,275, creating ""Excess Revenue"" of $627,551. Before it can be said that the amount of $627,551 is in fact excess revenue it is necessary to discuss other contentions of Safe Harbor and of the Commission.
We should point out that Safe Harbor vigorously asserts that even if its rates be regulated under Section 206 it is entitled as a matter of law to an undepreciated rate base. As we have indicated we find this contention to be without merit. Nothing in Section 206 requires such a result, and Section 206 with the interpolation of the provisions of Section 20, less those of Section 3(13), does not necessitate such a conclusion. As we view the law, the Commission is entitled to depreciate Safe Harbor's capital investment and deduct depreciation in a proper amount so long as the rate of depreciation is a reasonable one justified by all the circumstances. Such a conclusion seems to us to rest upon the interpretation of the Supreme Court in the Hope Natural Gas Company case, which we think provides a persuasive analogy for the determination of this aspect of case at bar. We will deal with ""Depreciation"" at greater length under the following sub-heading.
C. Is the item designated ""Depreciation"" in the amount of $504,100 in the ""Operating Revenues Statement"" correct? The amount of $504,100 representing depreciation results because the Commission has required Safe Harbor to adopt the so-called ""Straight-Line"" method of depreciation beginning January 1, 1947 ""* * * for the purpose of computing its bills for energy or power * * *"". See the order under review. The Commission has found the straight-line depreciation method to be the proper and adequate method under Section 302 of the Federal Power Act. In addition to the foregoing the Commission held that the ""Service lives used by Safe Harbor in accounting for depreciation for the year 1943 * * *"" as set forth in Exhibit 39 are reasonable and proper to be used in connection with the straight-line method of depreciation. See Findings (16) and (17), 5 F.P.C. at pp. 268-269. The Commission stated in its opinion, 5 F.P.C. at p. 257, ""Safe Harbor's depreciation reserve, however, is deficient by about $3,000,000 as compared with its reserve requirement calculated on a straight-line basis and using the service-life estimates which it has been using. This deficiency must ultimately be made up if the capital impairment is to be avoided. For this reason and because the service-life estimates used by Safe Harbor in 1943 are within the realm of reasonableness, we think their use is proper. Hereafter, the annual depreciation charge shall be computed according to the straight-line method on the basis of the service-life estimates used by Safe Harbor in 1943.""
Section 302 provides as follows:
""(a) The Commission may, after hearing, require licensees and public utilities to carry a proper and adequate depreciation account in accordance with such rules, regulations, and forms of account as the Commission may prescribe. The Commission may, from time to time, ascertain and determine, and by order fix, the proper and adequate rates of depreciation of the several classes of property of each licensee and public utility. Each licensee and public utility shall conform its depreciation accounts to the rates so ascertained, determined, and fixed. The licensees and public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall not charge to operating expenses any depreciation charges on classes of property other than those prescribed by the Commission, or charge with respect to any class of property a percentage of depreciation other than that prescribed therefor by the Commission. No such licensee or public utility shall in any case include in any form under its operating or other expenses any depreciation or other charge or expenditure included elsewhere as a depreciation charge or otherwise under its operating or other expenses. Nothing in this section shall limit the power of a State commission to determine in the exercise of its jurisdiction, with respect to any public utility, the percentage rate of depreciation to be allowed, as to any class of property of such public utility, or the composite depreciation rate, for the purpose of determining rates or charges.
""(b) The Commission, before prescribing any rules or requirements as to accounts, records, or memoranda, or as to depreciation rates, shall notify each State commission having jurisdiction with respect to any public utility involved, and shall give reasonable opportunity to each such commission to present its views, and shall receive and consider such views and recommendations.""
It is not necessary to include herein an extended discussion of the ""Straight-Line"" method of depreciation as compared with the ""Compound-Interest"" method or the ""Sinking-Fund"" method. These methods are clearly described in the Commission's opinion, 5 F.P.C. at pp. 246-256. It is true that by its order of June 11, 1940 the Commission prescribed for Safe Harbor the use by it of the compound-interest method, stating in its opinion, 2 F.P.C. at p. 189, ""Considering all the circumstances in this case, it is believed that the 4¼% compound-interest depreciation method should be employed rather than the straight-line or sinking-fund method."" It appears that the service lives appearing on Exhibit 39 had been employed by Safe Harbor in accounting for depreciation in conjunction with the 4¼% compound-interest method of depreciation. This was required by the Commission's order of June 11, 1940. See 2 F.P.C. at pp. 186-187, 194.
Safe Harbor makes a vigorous attack on the findings of the Commission referred to. It asserts that the Commission's result increases the annual allowance for depreciation for the year 1944 from approximately $237,000 to $504,000 and contends that the Commission's ""* * * findings are wholly unsupported by any credible evidence whatever"", that as a matter of law it was necessary for the Commission to have had exhaustive studies of depreciation made by qualified engineers before it could issue valid orders either as to the extent of depreciation existing in Safe Harbor's property or the correct amount of annual depreciation expense in the future, citing inter alia Pacific Gas Electric Co. v. City and County of San Francisco, 265 U.S. 403, 44 S.Ct. 537, 68 L.Ed. 1075, and Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 292 U.S. 151, 54 S.Ct. 658, 78 L.Ed. 1182. Exhibit 39 estimates service lives for Safe Harbor's depreciable physical property and equipment. This was referred to in the Commission's opinion in 2 F.P.C. at pp. 188-189, and was imposed on Safe Harbor by the Commission's order of June 11, 1940, which this court set aside.
There is little to be added to what the Commission has stated in its opinion respecting observed depreciation evidence as a measure of accrued depreciation. The Commission, quite properly we think, rejected the theory of observed depreciation preferring to estimate depreciation as a ""using-up of service life"" and not as a ""sudden event which occurs in the final stages of service."" See 5 F.P.C. at p. 250. The Commission has employed a method of depreciation which will afford great certainty to rate base making whereas Safe Harbor prefers that method which will result in a much higher rate base over a long period of time. That the straight-line depreciation method now ordered by the Commission is desirable seems to us to be open to no serious question. See for example ""Prudent Investment"", Bauer, 53 Yale L.J. 495, 505 et seq. (1944), and ""Depreciation and Effective Rate Control"", by the same authority, 54 Yale L.J., 92 et seq. (1944).
We reject Safe Harbor's contention that Exhibit 39, introduced into evidence in the instant case, does not afford a factual basis for the conclusions of the Commission as to service lives. The determination of service lives is one which rests peculiarly within the expert administrative discretion of the Commission. See Section 302(a), Part III. Whether the estimates contained in Exhibit 39 be used in connection with the compound-interest method of depreciation or the straight-line method is immaterial. These estimates will stand as one of the bases for either method.
The position of Safe Harbor in respect to the service lives of its dam, forebay, ramp, tailrace and powerhouse is not clear to us, but Safe Harbor seems to contend that these properties are really nondepreciable. Against the present factual background we cannot say that the Commission erred in finding certain properties depreciable which Safe Harbor asserts should be depreciated over a much longer period or in effect not depreciated at all. We cannot say that the conclusion of the Commission that certain physical properties possess a life of one hundred years is either capricious or arbitrary. The most solid physical object will deteriorate in time and by reason of a wide variety of circumstances. Many of the physical and economic sources that may bring about depreciation are not observable or visible. What Safe Harbor has done in offering the study of two engineers respecting depreciation in its physical properties is to present an issue of fact which lies distinctly within the province of the Commission. We may not try such issues.
It must be conceded that the Commission's position in respect to the depreciation method to be applied has been altered by time and, we may presume, by greater knowledge. As we have indicated, it compelled Safe Harbor by its order of June 11, 1940 to make use of the compound-interest method of depreciation employing 4¼% and rejected the straight-line and sinking-fund methods. But an agency is not compelled to be consistent, though consistency is a jewel in any crown. It is clear that by compelling Safe Harbor to adopt, although in midstream, a different method of accounting the Commission has not deprived Safe Harbor, its stockholders or the public of any substantial right. The Commission has acted in what it deems to be the public interest and has advanced sound reasons for a change of policy. There is no basis for judicial interference here.
We conclude, therefore, that the item designated ""Depreciation"" in the ""Operating Revenues Statement"" represents a correct and a proper application of the statute. The other deductions in the ""Operating Revenues Statement"" do not require explanation or discussion since there can be no serious dispute as to their validity.
III. Rate of Return.
A. Has the Commission unduly minimized Safe Harbor's risks, given undue weight to its power contracts and to the backing of its parent companies, fallaciously disregarded the actual cost of Safe Harbor's bond money or failed to give proper weight to similar factors? We do not propose to discuss the contentions of Safe Harbor in these respects at length. Upon full consideration we cannot conclude that the Commission has unduly minimized Safe Harbor's financial risks. It would be difficult to conceive of a more secure hydroelectric project. Safe Harbor's contracts for power and its backing by the Pennsylvania and Maryland Companies are exemplary. It is true the Commission has decided that the actual cost of Safe Harbor's bond money, 5.25%, should not be employed because it has considered Safe Harbor to be tardy in refinancing at a lower figure. The Commission stated, ""There could be no doubt that Safe Harbor can refinance at a great saving in interest cost. We have no doubt that it could refund today at a cost not to exceed 3 percent."" See 5 F.P.C. at p. 260, an the star note cited to the text. The conclusion of the Commission seems fully justified. See Bluefield Water Works Improvement Co. v. Public Serv. Comm., 262 U.S. 679, 692-693, 43 S.Ct. 675, 67 L.Ed. 1176, and United Railways Electric Co. of Baltimore v. West, 280 U.S. 234, 251, 50 S.Ct. 123, 74 L.Ed. 390. We can perceive no issue which can arise under the Fifth Amendment on this question. Nor can we agree that the Commission's order imposes upon investors the net cost of the retention of reserve assets, thereby compelling Safe Harbor to render service to consumers at less than cost. This argument is answered, we think, by what has been hereinbefore stated in respect to propriety of the rate base found by the Commission and by what will be said hereinafter respecting the fair return to Safe Harbor and hence to its investors. But if the rate base be a fair one and the rate of return found by the Commission be justified, ""The net cost of the retention of reserve assets"", to employ Safe Harbor's words, assuming this to be more than a mere bookkeeping figure, will not result in damage to Safe Harbor, to its investors or to its rate payers. It cannot become a detriment if the rate of return be a fair one. Safe Harbor will not be compelled to render service to its consumers at less than ""full cost"". The charges which Safe Harbor will be permitted to make to its consumers will be fair and reasonable both to them and to it. Other arguments made by Safe Harbor, assimilable to this heading, do not require discussion.
B. Is the rate of return of 5% found by the Commission a ""fair return""? This question is indeed the important one in the case and everything which we have previously stated is intended to lead to what we believe is the proper answer. Categorically stated that answer is ""Yes."" Safe Harbor's major argument to be dealt with under this heading is that the investment of Safe Harbor's securities and its ability to render adequate service to its consumers, to function properly as a hydroelectric project dispensing electric energy in interstate commerce, will be destroyed or seriously impaired by the order of the Commission. The Commission made a complete study of Safe Harbor's economic record as well as of its physical properties. Every pertinent issue has been fully discussed and considered by the Commission. The findings of the Commission find full support in the record and its conclusions of law, except possibly those based on Section 3(13), Part I, are in accord with the Federal Power Act. A major question presented for determination by the Commission was the ascertainment of a proper rate base for Safe Harbor. This problem is really one of valuation and of accounting. The other major question for the Commission was the determination of a ""fair return"" on that rate base. Both questions are peculiarly within the administrative capacity of the Commission. A persuasive analogy is presented, we think, by the decision of the Supreme Court in S.E.C. v. Central-Illinois Corp., 338 U.S. 96, 113-127, 69 S.Ct. 1377. In the cited case Mr. Justice Rutledge stated in substance that the finding of the Securities and Exchange Commission as to valuation based upon expert judgment, discretion, prediction supported by evidence and ""fact"" and made pursuant to rational statutory construction, were not subject to reexamination on judicial review under Section 11(e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 15 U.S.C.A. § 79k (e). Cf. Section 206(a) of the Federal Power Act. See Section 313(b), Part III, which provides that ""The finding of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive."" There are differences between the Federal Power Act and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 but the principle enunciated by the Supreme Court in the cited case seems to delimit the powers of a court reviewing the determinations of an administrative agency within the field confided to it by Congress. The provisions of Section 313(b) of the Federal Power Act are explicit. The scope of our review therefore is circumscribed but we may state that were we reviewing the matter de novo we would reach the same conclusions as those expressed by the Commission.
We have held that the rate base ascertained by the Commission is a proper one in the light of all the circumstances and we have ruled in effect that the Commission in applying Section 206, Part II, arrived at an interpretation of the Federal Power Act which gave a correct statutory result for the reasons hereinbefore stated and which need not be repeated here. We went further and searched the factual basis employed by the Commission in arriving at the rate base and we have been able to find no serious disparity in the views expressed by the Commission and in our own. If the analogy presented by the Central-Illinois Corporation case, supra, be persuasive, and we think that it is, controversy as to Safe Harbor's rate base should be at an end.
As to rate of return, similar considerations must prevail. The amount of rate of return is preeminently a question for determination by the Commission and the rate of return prescribed by it for Safe Harbor would have to be clearly confiscatory or outside the purview of the statute to permit judicial interference with the determination. We are aware of course that the Commission in its 1940 decision fixed 6% as a fair rate of return, 2 F.P.C. at p. 194. It should be noted that that rate of return was fixed by the Commission after applying the formula of Section 3(13), Part I. This may have had its effect upon the present determination by the Commission but in any event no rate of return is nailed to the Commission's head.
Safe Harbor contends that the Commission's finding that 5% constitutes a fair and reasonable rate of return is unsupported by substantial evidence and is not in accordance with law. This position cannot be sustained. The evidence in the record on rate of return is extensive indeed and we shall not review it in this too lengthy opinion. The Commission has adhered to the doctrine enunciated in Bluefield Water Works Improvement Company v. Public Serv. Comm., 262 U.S. at page 693, viz., 43 S.Ct. at page 679, ""The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties.""
The rate fixed by the Commission assures a fair return in our judgment but again the scope of our review is limited by analogy to the Central-Illinois Corporation case, supra. In conclusion on this aspect of the instant case it seems desirable to repeat the words employed by Mr. Justice Douglas in the Hope Natural Gas Co. case (Federal Power Comm. v. Hope Natural Gas Co.), 320 U.S. 591, at page 602, 64 S.Ct. 281, at page 288, 88 L.Ed. 333, ""If the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, judicial inquiry under the Act is at an end. The fact that the method employed to reach that result may contain infirmities is not then important. Moreover, the Commission's order does not become suspect by reason of the fact that it is challenged. It is the product of expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity. And he who would upset the rate order under the Act carries the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences."" No such showing has been made by Safe Harbor in the instant case.
Other points raised by Safe Harbor and by the Commission do not require discussion.
The order of the Commission will be affirmed.
Judge O'CONNELL heard the argument and participated in the consideration of this case but died before it was decided.

Hydropower enjoys broad public support
Americans view hydropower as a clean, reliable and renewable resource, and support hydro-specific initiatives for tax credits, federal reinvestment in facility upgrades, and federal investment in research and development, according to a new poll of 1,006 adults conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International on behalf of the National Hydropower Association. Check out the Fact Sheet and Poll Results for more information.
VIEWS OF HYDROPOWER
Hydropower enjoys a strongly positive reputation as an energy source. Nearly four-in-five Americans (78%) believe hydropower is cleaner than other current forms of energy, and roughly the same number (77%) think of hydropower as an environmentally-friendly resource. Moreover, hydropower is also seen as renewable (74%) and reliable (72%) by nearly three-quarters of Americans.
With all of these attributes there is broad bipartisan consensus that they describe hydropower well – with majorities of Democrats, Republicans and Independents in agreement.
HYDROPOWER’S FUTURE
Americans believe in maintaining the current hydropower infrastructure – and expanding the energy source going forward.
Four-in-five (81%) say they favor maintaining existing hydroelectric power plants in the United States to generate electricity.
Nearly as many Americans (75%) favor expanding hydropower in the United States.
HYDROPOWER REGULATION & LEGISLATION
Americans are also highly supportive of various initiatives that would improve hydropower regulation and initiatives that would promote hydropower. This support is strong, broad and bi-partisan with majorities of Democrats, Republicans and Independents supporting each of these initiatives.  Specifically, majorities favor:
Federal investment in research and development into emerging hydropower technologies (77%),
Federal government reinvestment of revenue from government-owned hydropower facilities to modernize and upgrade these facilities (77%),
Hydropower receiving the same credits and incentives as other renewable energy sources like wind and solar (74%), and;
Changing federal regulations so it takes less time to re-license an existing dam or retrofit a current dam to produce electricity (69%).
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
A strong majority of Americans in both parties support hydropower and policies to promote it.

Park Perspectives: Old plant, new challenges
By Kristina Ashby
February 1, 2014
In the small eastern Adirondack community of Wadhams, a wood-sided building with rusted metal roof extends along the top of the rocky bank of the Boquet River. Its various sections join to each other with a sense of purpose that grows from adding space as a need arises, laterally along the bank and over the side in an addition suspended over the water.
If you stand outside, close to the door, you can hear a rumble coming from inside. It tells the story of the unlikely things that happened when a pursuit of artistic glass blowing intersected with the painful squeeze of the 1970s energy crunch.
Pass through that door in the company of owner Matt Foley and you see that the rumble, now a dull roar, comes from a hulking assembly of four-foot pipe leading into a turbine that powers a shaft that drives the wheels of an electric generator. A wall on the far side sports the levers, gauges, and gizmos that control the equipment. The place looks like you’d imagine Thomas Edison’s garage might appear. In fact, the gauges bear the General Electric name and a patent date of 1896.
This is the generating station of River Rat Glass & Electric, and it’s a thoroughly Adirondack place: burly and utilitarian with a mix of cobbled-together ingenuity, a literal connection to place, self-sufficiency, and respect for renewable resources.
The water that drops forty-eight feet from a dammed pond has been a source of power since settlers established mills in the early 1800s. Daniel Payne built the hydro plant in 1904 as electrical technology was developing rapidly. It had a transmission line running to Mineville to help power the iron mine. Four years later, he started supplying electricity to local houses.
Foley entered the scene in 1976, moving to Wadhams from Vermont as part of a quest to find a better way to power a glass-blowing studio. He had been creating glass pieces in Vermont when trouble hit.

“The original energy crisis came along, and we had a thousand-gallon propane tank that we had to fill up every three weeks. Suddenly the price doubled. I liked blowing glass, but I didn’t like buying the gas. I was feeling a little guilty about burning all this stuff just to make beautiful things for people with disposable income to buy.”
He thought hydroelectric power offered a way to escape the grip of the oil producers, and he set out to look at old dams. He started in Vermont and New Hampshire but eventually found this one in Wadhams.
A glass artist with a degree in psychology, he had no idea how to fix up and operate the plant. When he acquired it, one generator had been destroyed by lightning. The four-hundred-foot pipeline that carried water from the dam to the plant was bad. The year after he bought it, the dam washed out.
But much of the electrical equipment was intact, and with his wife, Elizabeth, Foley found and adapted used pipe. He studied the technology and restored equipment. And with the help of a previous manager, he brought one generator on line. At first, he wanted only enough electricity to power his electric melting furnaces so he could resume glass blowing. He did that for a time but eventually received an interest-free loan from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and became an electricity producer, selling power to the grid. That meant getting a second generator operating.
Now, with both generators working, the plant can produce four hundred kilowatts of electricity in the best conditions, enough to power four hundred homes. But output varies with water levels, and the annual average is two hundred kilowatts. Foley is also partner in a hydro plant in St. Regis Falls.
So has the venerable plant lived up to the vision of s attractive about small hydropower from the viewpoint of energy policy.
“Nothing,” he says. “Don’t do it.”
The problem is that while federal law requires utilities to purchase power from small producers, the prices are not set. When he first went on line, the market price was 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour.
Then the state legislature passed a law setting a floor of six cents per kilowatt hour, and that was enough to make a go of it and even build the St. Regis Falls power plant. Then the law was repealed, and prices rose and fell. The current rate of four cents per kilowatt hour is not enough, Foley says. “That doesn’t pay bills.”
“We can stumble along and pay the day-to-day expenses, but we’re using equipment that’s over one hundred years old.” That means more costs as it requires replacement.
In August 2011, Tropical Storm Irene sent floodwaters surging down the region’s rivers, including the Boquet. “Irene set us back years,” Foley says. It did $50,000 in uninsured damage to the parking lot, the building, and a generator. He has yet to recover. “Rates are very low now, so all that $50,000 is debt that’s kind of hanging out there and not getting paid.”
So in Adirondack fashion Foley and his small hydro natural resources and at times being pummeled by them; making a living through ingenuity and self-sufficiency yet feeling controlled by distant economic forces beyond his reach.
Will he continue?
“I have no choice.”

Hi,
I just came across this article while searching for Matt Foley, glass artist. My sister gave me one of his beautiful (signed) paperweights back in 1974, and I have treasured it always. Wherever I have moved to over the years, it has gone with me, and sat on my desk in sunlight, if conditions allowed. It was inspiring to see this great work he is now doing for the folks in his communities. Perhaps you could pass my comment on to him?
All best,
Khristine Hopkins

Hydropower is a joke because it’s over-regulated and financial losses are the rule when it comes to small privately-owned hydropower facilities. Just look at what happened to Foley; he’s been struggling for years trying to make a profit from his hydropower plants and the strain on him shows.
As for me, after dealing with decades of personal and professional disappointments I sold my home and emigrated to the free state of Tennessee where I have a good job in the water treatment industry. Retirement is still several years away but in the meantime I take great satisfaction knowing that NY won’t ever get a dime of my income in taxes (and the people that bought my home reside in another state so NY won’t see anything from them either).
To those people in NY who also want to flee the one-party state, don’t come to TN if you plan to bring your crap-ass Democratic politics with you.
F hydropower and FJB.

Terms of use
The information provided by the power outages information service is approximate. It is presented based on the time zone to which the device is set.
Under no circumstances shall Hydro-Québec be held liable for any use of or inability to use the information on the maps or service status by region report. It is the responsibility of local occupants to protect their property.
While Hydro-Québec updates the information on outages and planned service interruptions on the maps and in the service status by region report, it cannot guarantee the accuracy or content of this information, including when service is expected to be restored.
Certain outage areas may not be listed on the maps. The areas identified on the maps and the time when service is expected to be restored are approximate, as is the rest of the information (cause, number of customers without power, etc.).
The service status by region report indicates the number of customers without power in each region of the province. It includes the power outages and scheduled interruptions that are currently underway. Unlike a power outage, which is unplanned, a planned service interruption is an intentional interruption of service for a set period of time for system maintenance purposes.
All persons must take the necessary steps to mitigate damage that may be caused by a planned service interruption or power outage.

About us
Eagle Creek Renewable Energy was founded in 2010 to acquire, enhance and operate small hydroelectric power facilities.  Eagle Creeks’ facilities provide clean energy to electricity consumers in North America while allowing recreational opportunities and protecting historical resources and the environment.  Eagle Creek currently owns and operates eighty-six hydroelectric facilities representing approximately 640 megawatts of capacity across  the United States.  Eagle Creek also has ownership interests equivalent to approximately 12 megawatts in fourteen other hydroelectric facilities and two solar facilities in New England.

Eagle Creek is a privately-owned entity and is wholly-owned subsidiary of Ontario Power Generation.

In November 2018, Ontario Power Generation (OPG) acquired Eagle Creek from Hudson Clean Energy Partners, Power Energy Corporation and its other previous investors. On October 8, 2019, Ontario Power Generation announced the finalization of the acquisition of Cube Hydro Partners and Helix Partners (collectively, Cube Hydro) from I Squared Capital. The two companies are now merging into one, operating under the Eagle Creek Renewable Energy Name. 

Eagle Creek continues to seek opportunities to acquire hydroelectric facilities and improve them to increase clean power production, operate them in harmony with the environment and enhance the value of the company's hydroelectric portfolio for its investor, employees, host communities and all stakeholders in the projects.

2. HYDROLOGY • • • • • • Introduction The hydrologic cycle Measurement of run-off Hydrograph Flow duration curve Mass curve
3. INTRODUCTION • It is the science which deals with the depletion and replenishment of water resources. • It deals with the surface water as well as the ground water. • It is also concerned with the transportation of water from on place to another. • It helps us in determining the occurrence and availability of water.
4. THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE • Most of the earth’s water sources, such as rivers, lakes, oceans and underground sources etc get their supply from rains (By Precipitation), while the rain water itself is the evaporation from these sources. • This evaporation and precipitation continues forever and process is known as hydrologic cycle. P=R+E P-Precipitation R-Run-Off E-Evaporation
6. MEASUREMENT OF RUN-OFF • Run-off can be measured daily, monthly, seasonal or yearly. • It can be measured by the following methods1. From rainfall records Run-off over the catchment = rainfall x coefficient 2. Empirical formulae a) Khosla’s formula R = P - 4.811 T R-Annual run-off in mm P-Annual rainfall in mm T-mean temperature in ˚C b) Inglis formula for areas of Maharashtra For ghat region R = 0.88 P – 304.8 For plain region R = (P-177.8) x P / 2540
7. MEASUREMENT OF RUN-OFF c) Lacey’s formula R = P / (1 + 3084 F / PS) R = monsoon run-off in mm S = catchment area factor F = monsoon duration factor P = monsoon rainfall in mm Value of S is minimum for flat places (0.25) and is maximum for very hilly places (3.45) F = 0.5 for very short monsoon F = 1.0 for standard length monsoon F = 1.5 for very long monsoon
8. MEASUREMENT OF RUN-OFF 3. Run-off curves and tables • • Each region has its own catchment area and rainfall characteristics and for the same region the characteristics mostly remain unchanged. Based on this fact the run-off coefficients are derived once for all. Then a graph is plotted in which one axis represents rainfall and the other run-off. The curves obtained are called run-off curves. 4. Discharge observation method • To find out the sub-surface run-off it is essential to separate the subsurface flow from the total flow. The separation can be on an approximate basis but with correct analysis.
9. HYDROGRAPH • It is defined as a graph showing discharge of flowing water with respect to time for a specified time. • Hydrograph of stream of river will depend on the characteristics of the catchment and precipitation over the catchment. • It will access the flood flow of rivers hence it is essential that anticipated hydrograph could be drawn for river for a given storm. • It indicates the power available from the stream at different times of day, week, month or year.
10. THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH • A unit hydrograph represents unit run-off resulted from an intense rainfall of unit duration and specific areal distribution. • Introduction of unit hydrograph theory in 1932 made it possible to predict a run-off hydrograph corresponding to an hypothetical storm. • The basic concept of unit hydrograph is that the hydrographs of run-off from two identical storms would be the same. In practice identical storms occur very rarely. This makes it necessary to construct a typical hydrograph.
11. For any catchment unit hydrograph can be prepared once then whenever peak flow is to be find out, multiply the maximum ordinate of unit hydrograph by the run-off value expressed in cm.
12. LIMITATIONS TO THE USE OF UNIT HYDROGRAPHS • Its use is limited to area about 5000 sq. kilometers since similar rainfall distribution over a large area from storm to storm is rarely possible. • The odd shaped basins have very uneven rainfall distribution, therefore, unit hydrograph method is not adopted to such basins.
13. FLOW DURATION CURVE • This curve is plotted between flow available during period versus the fraction of time. • If the magnitude on the ordinate is the potential power contained in the stream flow, then the curve is known as “power duration curve”. • The flow duration curve is drawn with the help of a hydrograph from the available run-off data and here it is necessary to find out the length of time duration which certain flow are available. • The area under the flow duration curve gives the total quantity of run-off during that period.
14. Steep slope throughout – it indicates a stream with highly variable discharge (flow is mainly from surface run-off) A flat slope – it indicates small variability (streams receiving both surfacerunoff and ground water run-off) Flow Duration Curve A flow duration curve plotted on a log-log paper provides a qualitative description of the run-off variability in the stream. Flat portion at the lower end – it indicates substantial contribution from ground water run-off.
15. FLOW DURATION CURVE • If the head of discharge is known, the possible power developed from water in kW Power (kW) = ( wQH/1000) n₀ Q-Discharge, m3 /sec H-Head available, m W-weight density of water, N/m3 n₀-Overall efficiency • Thus the flow duration curve can be converted to a power duration with some other scale on the same graph. • Flow duration curves are most useful for preliminary studies and for comparison between streams.
16. USE OF FLOW DURATION CURVE 1. A flow duration curve allows the evaluation of low level flows. 2. For hydropower studies, the flow duration curve serves to determine the potential for firm power generation. The firm power is also known as the primary power. Secondary power is the power generated at the plant utilising water other than that used for the generation of firm power. 3. The flow duration curve also finds use in the design of drainage systems and in flood control studies.
17. SHORTCOMINGS OF FLOW DURATION CURVE • Not present the flows in natural source of occurrence. • Not possible to tell from flow duration curve whether the lowest flow occurred in consecutive periods or were scattered throughout the considered period.
18. MASS CURVE A mass curve is the graph of the cumulative values of water quantity against time. An integral curve of the hydrograph which expresses the area under the hydrograph from one time to another. convenient device to determine storage requirement that is needed to produce a certain dependable flow from fluctuating discharge of a river by a reservoir. solve the reserve problem of determining the maximum demand rate that can be maintained by a given storage volume.
19. SITE SELECTION 1. Availability of water – All other designs are based on it. – Estimate should be made about the average quantity of water available throughout the year and also about maximum and minimum quantity of water available during the year. – These details are necessary to decide the capacity of the hydropower plant, and – It also provide adequate spillways or gate relief during flood period.
20. SITE SELECTION 2. Water storage – Since there a is wide variation in rainfall during the year, therefore it is necessary to store the water for continuous generation of power. The storage capacity can be calculated with the help of mass curve. – The two types of storages in use are 1. The storage is so constructed that it can make water available for power generation for one year only. 2. Water is available in sufficient quantity even during the worst dry periods.
21. SITE SELECTION 3. Water head – In order to generate a requisite quantity of power it is necessary that a large quantity of water at sufficient head should be available. – An increase in effective head for a given output, reduces the quantity of water required to be supplied to the turbines.
22. SITE SELECTION 4. Accessibility of site – The site where hydro-electric plant is to be constructed should be easy accessible. This is important if the electric power generated is to be utilised at or near the plant site. – The site selected should have transportation facilities of rail and road.
23. SITE SELECTION 5. Distance from the load centre – Power plant should be set up near the load centre, this will reduce the cost of maintenance of transmission line.
24. SITE SELECTION 6. Type of the land of the site – The land to be selected for the site should be cheap and rocky. – The ideal site will be one where the dam will have largest catchment area to store water at high head and will be economical in construction. – Necessary requirement of the foundation rocks for masonry dam are• • • The rock should be strong enough to withstand the stresses transmitted from the dam structure as well as the thrust of the water when the reservoir is full. The rock in the foundation of the dam should be reasonably impervious. The rock should remain stable under all condtitions.

Damming rivers can permanently alter river systems and wildlife habitats. A dam blocks fish migration, stops nutrients from flowing downstream, and changes water quality, all of which negatively impact the river ecosystem. The Iron Gates dams on the Danube River block important spawning sites and do not have fish passes, disrupting the migration and spawning of endangered sturgeon species.

 Environmental impacts of hydroelectric power
1. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF HYDROPOWER
2. About hydropower The water behind the dam flows through an intake and pushes against blades in a turbine, causing them to turn. The turbine spins a generator to produce electricity. The amount of electricity that can be generated depends on how far the water drops and how much water moves through the system. The electricity can be transported over long-distance electric lines to homes, factories, and businesses.  Hydropower (from hydro, meaning water) is energy that comes from the force of moving water. The fall and movement of water is part of a continuous natural cycle called the water cycle.  A typical hydro plant is a system with three parts: an electric plant where the electricity is produced; a dam that can be opened or closed to control water flow; and a reservoir where water can be stored.
3. About hydropower Clean and renewabl e energy source  Hydropower is the cheapest way to generate electricity today. That's because once a dam has been built and the equipment installed, the energy source—flowing water—is free.  It's a clean fuel source that is renewable yearly by snow and rainfall.  Furthermore, hydro plants do not emit pollutants into the air because they burn no fuel.  Hydropower is also readily available; engineers can control the flow of water through the turbines to produce electricity on demand. In addition, reservoirs may offer recreational opportunities, such as swimming and boating.  Hydropower plants produce power cheaply due to their sturdy structures and simple equipment. Hydro plants are dependable and long-lived, and their maintenance costs are low compared to coal or nuclear plants.
4. Summary of the Environmental Impacts of Dams Damming rivers may permanentl y alter river systems and wildlife habitats.
5. The impact of dams on river ecosystems Negative effects  Negative environmental effects due to construction activities  Loss of wild lands, wetlands and wildlife habitat  Effects of stopping the flow of nutrients downstream  Reduced biological activity downstream  Anaerobic decomposition of vegetation and production of greenhouse gasses  Water-loss due to evaporation  Changes in water quality due to the lack of dissolved oxygen near the bottom of reservoirs. This is toxic to fish and can lead to the death of aquatic life. It is also corrosive to turbines.
6. The impact of dams on river ecosystems Negative effects  Accomodation of amphibians, riparian fauna and birds to a new environment  Migration of animals to new areas, where new equilibrium may favour some species over others  Blocking fish migration  Introducing of new species of fish in the reservoirs  Inappropriate reservoir operation with large variations in water levels could threaten fish by drying up shallow- breeding and flood producing areas.
7. The impact of dams on river ecosystems THE PYRAMID OF IMPACTS www.labond.com/Dams/...
8. The Iron Gates Dams and disruption of spawning migration of Danube sturgeons Sturgeons are very sensitive to habitat changes. Altered habitats can immediately impact on their spawning, wintering and feeding success, and ultimately lead to their extinction.  Iron Gates is the largest hydropower dam and reservoir system along the entire Danube. The system consists of two main dams, Iron Gates I and II, built in 1972 and 1985 respectively. The dams are constructed at river km 942 and river km 863 upstream of the Danube delta, in effect confining migratory sturgeons to 863 km of the river and cutting off important spawning sites in the Middle Danube.  The Iron Gates dams do not have technical equipment such as fish passes or bypasses, designed to assist fish

Our Power Sources
Mayfield Dam
We serve nearly 181,630 people in Tacoma, University Place, Fircrest, Lakewood, Federal Way, Steilacoom, Joint Base Lewis McChord, portions of Fife and other areas of Pierce County as far south as Roy.
Though we use various power sources as needed, most of our electricity comes from clean, renewable hydroelectric energy generated at our four hydro projects on four rivers in western Washington. Our projects include:
Cowlitz River Project (Click here to sign up for our Cowlitz River Project email list).
Nisqually River Project
Wynoochee River Project
Cushman Hydroelectric Project (Click here to sign up for our Cushman Hydro Project email list).
We also maintain an Integrated Resource Plan to guide us in exploring all available power sources and conservation options. This analysis helps ensure we have enough power resources to meet our long-term needs.
To learn more, see the following:
Watch a video about the use of clean, renewable hydroelectric energy in the U.S.

Hydroelectricity: 80.11%
Nuclear: 6.05%
Wind: 9.06%
Biomass: 0.27%
Solar: 2.27%
Unspecified: 2.24%
Tacoma Power’s fuel mix is nearly carbon free.
Licensing and Watershed Management
To operate our dams, we must maintain licenses issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees hydroelectric projects across the country. These licenses contain provisions for:
Fisheries programs, including hatcheries and the protection of native fish and their habitat.
Wildlife programs to protect and enhance habitat.
Parks and recreation areas near our reservoirs for public camping, swimming, fishing, nature watching, boating and day use.

How Hydroelectric Energy Works
Learn how moving water is converted into electricity in this comprehensive overview, including a discussion of the hydropower resource, its environmental and societal impacts, and the potential for future expansion of hydroelectic energy.
Hydroelectric power includes both massive hydroelectric dams and small run-of-the-river plants. Large-scale hydroelectric dams continue to be built in many parts of the world (including China and Brazil), but it is unlikely that new facilities will be added to the existing U.S. fleet in the future.
Instead, the future of hydroelectric power in the United States will likely involve increased capacity at current dams and new run-of-the-river projects. There are environmental impacts at both types of plants. 
EXPLAINER
Benefits of Renewable Energy Use
Renewable energy—wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass—provides substantial benefits for our climate, our health, and our economy.
Land use
The size of the reservoir created by a hydroelectric project can vary widely, depending largely on the size of the hydroelectric generators and the topography of the land. Hydroelectric plants in flat areas tend to require much more land than those in hilly areas or canyons where deeper reservoirs can hold more volume of water in a smaller space.
At one extreme, the large Balbina hydroelectric plant, which was built in a flat area of Brazil, flooded 2,360 square kilometers—an area the size of Delaware—and it only provides 250 MW of power generating capacity (equal to more than 2,000 acres per MW) [1].  In contrast, a small 10 MW run-of-the-river plant in a hilly location can use as little 2.5 acres (equal to a quarter of an acre per MW) [2]. 
 Flooding land for a hydroelectric reservoir has an extreme environmental impact: it destroys forest, wildlife habitat, agricultural land, and scenic lands. In many instances, such as the Three Gorges Dam in China, entire communities have also had to be relocated to make way for reservoirs [3].
Wildlife impacts
Dammed reservoirs are used for multiple purposes, such as agricultural irrigation, flood control, and recreation, so not all wildlife impacts associated with dams can be directly attributed to hydroelectric power. However, hydroelectric facilities can still have a major impact on aquatic ecosystems. For example, though there are a variety of methods to minimize the impact (including fish ladders and in-take screens), fish and other organisms can be injured and killed by turbine blades.
Apart from direct contact, there can also be wildlife impacts both within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoir water is usually more stagnant than normal river water. As a result, the reservoir will have higher than normal amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and other aquatic weeds. These weeds can crowd out other river animal and plant-life, and they must be controlled through manual harvesting or by introducing fish that eat these plants [4].  In addition, water is lost through evaporation in dammed reservoirs at a much higher rate than in flowing rivers. 
 In addition, if too much water is stored behind the reservoir, segments of the river downstream from the reservoir can dry out. Thus, most hydroelectric operators are required to release a minimum amount of water at certain times of year. If not released appropriately, water levels downstream will drop and animal and plant life can be harmed. In addition, reservoir water is typically low in dissolved oxygen and colder than normal river water. When this water is released, it could have negative impacts on downstream plants and animals. To mitigate these impacts, aerating turbines can be installed to increase dissolved oxygen and multi-level water intakes can help ensure that water released from the reservoir comes from all levels of the reservoir, rather than just the bottom (which is the coldest and has the lowest dissolved oxygen).
Life-cycle global warming emissions
 Global warming emissions are produced during the installation and dismantling of hydroelectric power plants, but recent research suggests that emissions during a facility’s operation can also be significant. Such emissions vary greatly depending on the size of the reservoir and the nature of the land that was flooded by the reservoir.
Small run-of-the-river plants emit between 0.01 and 0.03 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour. Life-cycle emissions from large-scale hydroelectric plants built in semi-arid regions are also modest: approximately 0.06 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour. However, estimates for life-cycle global warming emissions from hydroelectric plants built in tropical areas or temperate peatlands are much higher. After the area is flooded, the vegetation and soil in these areas decomposes and releases both carbon dioxide and methane. The exact amount of emissions depends greatly on site-specific characteristics. However, current estimates suggest that life-cycle emissions can be over 0.5 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour [5,6]. 
To put this into context, estimates of life-cycle global warming emissions for natural gas generated electricity are between 0.6 and 2 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour and estimates for coal-generated electricity are 1.4 and 3.6 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour [7].

Overview
The UK currently (2011) generates about 1.5% of its electricity from hydroelectric schemes. Although further large-scale development potential is limited, there is scope for exploiting our remaining small-scale hydro resources in a sustainable way.
Understanding hydroelectric power
Hydroelectric power is the energy derived from flowing water. This can be from rivers or man-made installations, where water flows from a high-level reservoir down through a tunnel and away from a dam.
Turbines placed within the flow of water extract its kinetic energy and convert it to mechanical energy. This causes the turbines to rotate at high speed, driving a generator that converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy.
The amount of hydroelectric power generated depends on the water flow and the vertical distance (known as ‘head’) the water falls through.
Types of hydroelectric schemes
There are 3 main types of hydroelectric schemes in use in the UK:
Storage schemes
In storage schemes, a dam impounds water in a reservoir that feeds the turbine and generator that are usually located within the dam itself.
Run-of-river schemes
Run-of-river schemes use the natural flow of a river, where a weir can enhance the continuity of the flow. Both storage and run-of-river schemes can be diversion schemes, where water is channelled from a river, lake or dammed reservoir to a remote powerhouse containing the turbine and generator.
Pumped storage
Pumped storage incorporates two reservoirs. At times of low demand, generally at night, electricity is used to pump water from the lower to the upper basin. This water is then released to create power at a time when demand, and therefore price, is high. Although not considered a renewable energy (because of its reliance on electricity), pumped storage is very good for improving overall energy efficiency.
UK use of hydroelectricity
There are 3 main categories used to define the output from hydroelectric power:
large-scale capacity: hydro plant producing more than 5 megawatts (MW)
small-scale capacity: hydro plant producing less than 5 megawatts
micro-scale capacity: hydro plant producing less than 50 kilowatts
The total hydroelectric installed capacity in the UK at the end of 2011 was approximately 1676 megawatts, which is around 1.9% of the current total UK generating capacity and 14% of renewable electricity generation capacity.
Hydroelectric power’s contribution to our renewables targets
The UK currently (2011) generates about 1.5% (5,700 Gwh) of its electricity from hydroelectric schemes - most of which are large-scale schemes in the Scottish Highlands.
Hydroelectric energy uses proven and efficient technology; the most modern plants have energy conversion efficiencies of 90% and above. Hydro has a typical load factor of 35 to 40%.
Future development
It is unlikely we will see again the scale of development witnessed in the UK in the 1950s and 1960s. Opportunities to use this technology on a large scale are now limited, not only because of environmental concerns but also because many of the most economically attractive sites for schemes have already been used. However, it is important we exploit our remaining small-scale hydro resources in a sustainable way.
Some old watermills are also being refurbished and brought back into the energy supply network.
Recent studies estimate there is a remaining viable hydro potential of 850 to 1550 megawatts in the UK. This represents approximately 1 to 2% of current UK generating capacity and so would make a modest but useful contribution to UK renewable energy and emission reduction targets. There are a number of steps that have to be considered before a scheme can be built, eg scheme economics, environmental permits, planning consent and connection to the local electricity network.
Installing a micro-hydro scheme on your property
A number of people have already installed micro-hydro schemes. In general, even small-scale schemes provide enough power for a number of houses or a small community.
Although upfront costs for hydropower are high, installations should last for decades. Low head installations can generate renewable energy 24 hours a day.
Feed-in Tariffs (FITs), available since April 2010 to reward renewable electricity generation, provide a further incentive but installers must consider issues such as protecting wildlife and fish - which may mean including additional features in the scheme design.
Contact the Energy Saving Trust on 0800 512 012 for more information. You can also find more details about micro-hydro installations on the Energy Saving Trust website and the Environment Agency’s run-of-river hydropower guidance.
Planning permission for hydro schemes
Hydro developers should contact the relevant local authority for specialist advice at the earliest stage before undertaking a feasibility study.
Developers will also require environmental permits from the Environment Agency (England), Natural Resources Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency or the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.
Finding an approved installer
The Microgeneration Certification Scheme’s (MCS) full micro-hydro standards are still under development. In the meantime, MCS transitional lists for installers and products are available. MCS is linked to eligibility for FITs less than 50kWs. FITs also reward the generation of hydro electricity less than 5MW.

The British Hydropower Association can tell you more about developments in your area.

 Hydroelectric power
1. MODULE- III HYDROELECTRIC POWER Prepared by Bibhabasu Mohanty Dept. of Civil Engineering SALITER, Ahmedabad
2. Contents • Low, Medium and High head plants, Power house components, Hydel schemes.
3. Introduction • Hydroelectric power (hydropower) systems convert the kinetic energy in flowing water into electric energy. • Falling or flowing water turns a propeller like piece called a turbine. • The turbine turns a metal shaft in an electric generator which produces electricity.
5. Advantages • No fuel required • No air pollution • Can easily work during high peak daily loads • Prevents floods
6. Disadvantages • Disrupts the aquatic ecosystems • Disruption of surrounding areas • Requires large areas • Large scale human displacement
8. How a Hydroelectric Power System Works? • Flowing water is directed at a turbine. • The flowing water causes the turbine to rotate, converting the water’s kinetic energy into mechanical energy.
9. • The mechanical energy produced by the turbine is converted into electric energy using a turbine generator. • Inside the generator, the shaft of the turbine spins a magnet inside coils of copper wire. • It is a fact of nature that moving a magnet near a conductor causes an electric current.
11. Hydel scheme 1 .Run-off Plants without Poundage: As name indicates this type of plant doesn’t store water, the plant uses as water comes. 2. Run-0ff plants with Poundage: Poundage permits storage of water during the off –peak period and use of this water during peak periods. 3. Reservoir Plants: A reservoir plant is that which has reservoir of such size as to permit carrying over storage from wet season to the next dry season.
12. 4 .Low head plants: In this case small dam is built across the river to provide the necessary head. In such plants Francis type of turbines are used. 5. Medium head plants: The fore bay provided at the beginning of Penstock serves as water reservoir for such plants. In these plants water is generally carried out in open canals from reservoir to the Fore bay and then to the penstock.
13. 6. High head Plant: This plants works above 500mtrs and Pelton wheel turbines are commonly used. In this plant water is carried out from the main reservoir by a tunnel up to surge tank and then from the surge tank to the power house in penstock. 7. Base Load Plants: These Plants are mainly depending on the nature of load. Is demand is more, this plants are used regularly and load factor of this plants are high.
14. 8. Peak load Plants: These plants are mainly used during the peak load. Run-off river plants with poundage can be used as peak-load plants. reservoir plants with enough storage behind the dam can be used either as base load or as peak load plants as required. 9. Pumped storage plants: These plants are used when quantity of water available for generation is insufficient. If it is possible to pond at head water and tail water locations after passing through the turbine is stored in the tail race pond from where it may be pumped back to the Head water pond.
15. Low head plants • In this case a small dam is built across the river to provide the necessary head. • The excess water is allowed to flow over the dam itself. • In such plants Francis, Propeller or Kaplan types of turbines are used. • Also no surge tank is required. • These plants are constructed where the water head available less then 30mtrs. • The production of electricity will be less due to low head.
17. Medium head plants • Mainly forebay provided before the Penstock, acts as water reservoir for medium head plants. • In this plants mainly water is carried through main reservoir to forebay and then to the penstock. • The forebay acts as surge tank for these plants. • The turbines used will be Francis type of the steel encased variety.
19. High head plants • Mainly in these plants pressure tunnel is provided before the surge tank, which inturn connected to penstock. • A pressure tunnel is taken off from the reservoir and water brought to the valve house at the start of the penstocks. • The penstocks are huge steel pipes which take large quantity of water from the valve house to the power house.
20. • The valve house contains main sluice gates and in addition automatic isolating valves which come into operation when the penstock bursts, cutting further supply of water. • Surge tank is an open tank and is built just in between the beginning of the penstocks and the valve house. • In absence of surge tank, the water hammer can damage the fixed gates.
21. • In Majority of dams Sluice gates are provided. • The sluice gates are opened when dam level is below level and there is shortage water for irrigation. • Normally the high head plants are 500 meters above and for heads above 500 meters Pelton wheels are used.
23. Components of hydel scheme The principal components are: 1. Forebay 2. Intake structure 3. Penstocks 4. Surge tank 5. Turbines 6. Power house 7. Draft tube 8. Tail race
25. Forebay • Enlarged body of water provided in front of penstock. • Provided in case of run off river plants and storage plants. • Main function to store water which is rejected by plant. • Power house located closed to dam penstock directly take water from reservoir, reservoir act as forebay.
27. Intake structure • Water conveyed from forebay to penstocks through intake structures. • Main components are trash rack and gate. • Trash rack prevent entry of debris.
28. Penstocks • open or closed conduits which carry water to the turbines. • made of reinforced concrete or steel. Concrete penstocks are suitable for low heads less then 30mtrs. • steel penstocks are designed for any head. • thickness of penstocks increases with head or water pressure
29. • penstocks gates are fixed to initial of penstocks, and flow of water is controlled by operating penstock gates. • Either buried in ground or kept exposed.
30. Surge tank • additional storage for near to turbine, usually provided in high head plants. • located near the beginning of the penstock. • As the load on the turbine decreases or during load rejection by the turbine the surge tank provides space for holding water.
31. • surge tank over comes the abnormal pressure in the conduit when load on the turbine falls and acts as a reservoir during increase of load on the turbine.
32. Turbines • turbines are used to convert the energy water of falling water into mechanical energy. • water turbine is a rotary engine that takes energy from moving water. • flowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner, creating a force on the
33. • Since the runner is spinning, the force acts through a distance n this way, energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine. • The principal types of turbines are: 1) Impulse turbine 2) Reaction Turbine
34. Impulse turbines: mainly used in high head plants. • the entire pressure of water is converted into kinetic energy in a nozzle and the velocity of the jet drives the blades of turbine. • The nozzle consist of a needle, and quantity of water jet falling on the turbine is controlled this needle placed in the tip of the nozzle. • If the load on the turbine decreases, the governor pushes the needle into the nozzle, thereby reducing the quantity of water striking the turbine.
35. • Examples of Impulse turbines are: • Pelton Wheel. • Turgo • Michell-Banki (also known as the Cross flow or Ossberger turbine.
37. Reaction turbines : are mainly for low and medium head plants. • In reaction turbine the water enters the runner partly with pressure energy and partly with velocity head. • Most water turbines in use are reaction turbines and are used in low (<30m/98 ft) and medium (30-300m/98–984 ft)head applications. • In reaction turbine pressure drop occurs in both fixed and moving blades.
38. • In this turbine the runner blades changed with respect to guide vane opening. • As the sudden decrease of load takes place, the guide vane limit decreases according to that runner blade closes. • Examples of reaction turbines are: Francis turbine Kaplan turbine
39. Kaplan Francis
40. Draft tube • is a pipe or passage of gradually increasing cross sectional area, which connect to the exit to tail race. • it reduces high velocity of water discharged by the turbine. • draft tube permits turbines to be installed at a higher level than the tail race level, which help the maintaince and repair of turbines.
42. Power house • Power house contains the electro mechanical equipment i.e. hydro power turbine, Generator, excitation system, main inlet valves, transformers, Switchyard, DC systems, governor, bus duct, step up transformers, step down transformers, high voltages switch gears, control metering for protection of systems.
43. Tail race • tail race tunnel or channel are provided to direct the used water coming out of draft tube back to the river. • important criteria of designing the tail race is kind of draft tube, the gross head and geographical situation of the area. • Tail race is designed in such a way that water hammer is minimizes when water leaves the draft tube.
45. Power generation The amount of electricity that can be generated by a hydropower plant depends on two factors: • flow rate - the quantity of water flowing in a given time; and • head - the height from which the water falls. The greater the flow and head, the more electricity produced. Flow Rate = the quantity of water flowing Head = the height from which water falls
46. A standard equation for calculating energy production: Power = (Head) x (Flow) x (Efficiency) 11.8 Power = the electric power in kilowatts or kW Head = the distance the water falls (measured in feet) Flow = the amount of water flowing (measured in cubic feet per second or cfs) Efficiency = How well the turbine and generator convert the power of falling water into electric power. This can range from 60% (0.60) for older, poorly maintained hydroplants to 90% (0.90) for newer, well maintained plants. 11.8 = Index that converts units of feet and seconds into kilowatts
47. As an example, let’s see how much power can be generated by the power plant. The dam is 357 feet high, the head (distance the water falls) is 235 feet. The typical flow rate is 2200 cfs. Let’s say the turbine and generator are 80% efficient. Power = (Head) x (Flow) x (Efficiency) 11.8 Power = 235ft. x 2200 cfs x .80 11.8
48. Power = 517,000 x .80 11.8 Power = 413,600 11.8 Power = 35,051 kilowatts (kW)

Spray Water Power and Land Company
by Lindley S. Butler, 2006
""Advertising card for Spray Water, Power & Land Co."" Image courtesy of Rockingham Community College Foundation, Inc., Historical Collections, Gerald B. James Library.
The Spray Water Power and Land Company, established in 1889 by James Turner Morehead, was a hydroelectric power, textile, and land development company that created the Spray industrial complex on the Smith River in the present-day town of Eden. Its antecedent had been a textile firm created by James Barnett and John Motley Morehead (James Turner Morehead's father and later a governor of North Carolina). The firm of Barnett and Morehead had operated a variety of mills, a cotton gin, a blacksmith shop, and a general store.
After the formation of the power and land development company, James Turner Morehead turned its operation over to his son-in-law, B. Frank Mebane, and a nephew, W. R. Walker, so that he could then devote his time to more challenging chemical and metal alloy experimentation. The Morehead family interests were now under the direction of Mebane and Walker, who secured northern capital for embarking on a long-range comprehensive textile development of the power resources. Beginning with Spray Cotton Mills in 1896, several mills were built in rapid succession: Nantucket (1898), American Warehouse (1899), Lily (1900), Spray Woolen and Morehead (1902), Rhode Island (1903), and German-American in Draper (1906). All of these mills remained in the company except Spray Cotton Mills, which was sold in 1897 to Karl von Ruck, whose relatives, the Bishoprics, developed the mill into a successful family-owned business during the twentieth century. The Spray corporation-which included three mills, Spray Cotton and Nova Yarns in Eden and a plant at Mt. Holly-maintained an industry-wide reputation for customer satisfaction and high-quality yarns. The company announced its closing in 2001 after 105 years of operation.
Although later divested of its textile interests and waterpower rights, the Spray Water Power and Land Company, still under the ownership and management of Morehead descendants, retained large tracts of land that have continued to be developed.

 Why Water Power?
With millions of miles of natural waterways across the US, water power is a readily available and consistent source of renewable energy. Already accounting for almost 7 percent of total electricity generation, water power is uniquely capable of filling in the gaps between traditional electricity sources and other intermittent renewable sources such as wind and sun. Water power can also be stored and, in fact, is the largest source of utility-scale energy storage in the country. As a result, water power can play a crucial role in balancing the needs of a more reliable and sustainable electric power grid with that of a thriving and sustainable environment.
Our Mission
ORNL will enhance and accelerate the contributions of water power in facilitating more reliable, resilient, sustainable and affordable electric power sources, infrastructure, and systems.
Research & Development
Our research focuses on reducing costs and improving performance of existing hydropower facilities and accelerating advances in new, sustainable water power technologies. ORNL’s strengths in data analytics, materials science, and environmental science provide a full complement of resources.

Although many of these dams have hydroelectric generators, only a small number of dams were built specifically for hydropower generation. Hydropower generators do not directly emit air pollutants. However, dams, reservoirs, and the operation of hydroelectric generators can affect the environment.
A dam that creates a reservoir (or a dam that diverts water to a run-of-river hydropower plant) may obstruct fish migration. A dam and reservoir can also change natural water temperatures, water chemistry, river flow characteristics, and silt loads. All of these changes can affect the ecology and the physical characteristics of the river. These changes may have negative effects on native plants and on animals in and around the river. Reservoirs may cover important natural areas, agricultural land, or archeological sites. A reservoir and the operation of the dam may also result in the relocation of people. The physical impacts of a dam and reservoir, the operation of the dam, and the use of the water can change the environment over a much larger area than the area a reservoir covers.
Manufacturing the concrete and steel in hydropower dams requires equipment that may produce emissions. If fossil fuels are the energy sources for making these materials, then the emissions from the equipment could be associated with the electricity that hydropower facilities generate. However, given the long operating lifetime of a hydropower plant (50 years to 100 years) these emissions are offset by the emissions-free hydroelectricity.
Greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide and methane form in natural aquatic systems and in human-made water storage reservoirs as a result of the aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of biomass in the water. The exact amounts of GHG that form in and are emitted from hydropower reservoirs is uncertain and depend on many site specific and regional factors.

?
The Safe Harbor Dam on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania has elevators that lift migrating shad from the base of the dam to the top of the reservoir.
Fish ladders help salmon reach their spawning grounds
Hydropower turbines kill and injure some of the fish that pass through the turbine. The U.S. Department of Energy has sponsored the research and development of turbines that could reduce fish deaths to lower than 2%, in comparison with fish kills of 5% to 10% for the best existing turbines.
Many species of fish, such as salmon and shad, swim up rivers and streams from the sea to reproduce in their spawning grounds in the beds of rivers and streams. Dams can block their way. Different approaches to fixing this problem include the construction of fish ladders and elevators that help fish move around or over dams to the spawning grounds upstream.

The Keowee-Toxaway Project
Keowee-Toxaway Hydroelectric Project Description
Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy) owns and operates the Keowee-Toxaway Hydroelectric Project (Project), located on the Keowee and Little rivers in the Savannah River Basin. The Project was developed by Duke Power, now Duke Energy, to generate electricity. The Project consists of two hydroelectric developments: Keowee Hydro Facility with Lake Keowee and Jocassee Pumped Storage Facility with Lake Jocassee. The Project provides 868 megawatts (MW) of clean, economical power.

Duke Energy operates the Project in accordance with a license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 1966. In addition to its role in providing electricity for the region, the Project reservoirs also provide numerous recreational opportunities for local residents and visitors, a reliable supply of cooling water for Oconee Nuclear Station, public water supplies and significant wildlife habitat. The current FERC operating license for the Project expires in 2016.

The Project is located in the region commonly referred to as the Piedmont Foothills. Water released from the Project at Keowee Hydro flows into Lake Hartwell, a hydroelectric reservoir operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and ultimately into the Atlantic Ocean at Savannah Harbor.

Cultural and Natural History
The names Keowee and Toxaway are both of Cherokee Native American origin. Keowee, meaning place of the mulberry, and Toxaway, meaning place of thunder, are reflective of the rich Native American culture that flourished in the Project area. Prior to settlement by European Americans, Native Americans hunted the area, built their towns along the rivers of the Project area and named the streams that flowed down from the mountains. Keowee Village, located on the banks of the Keowee River, was the capitol of the Lower Cherokee Towns and dated back to at least 1539. Keowee Village, also called Keowee Town, was a large settlement, extending for 8 to 10 miles, surrounding the hills and terraces. Some of the local cities surrounding Lake Keowee such as Six Mile, Twelve Mile and Ninety Six were named based on their distance from Keowee Town.

As more European Americans settled in the region, the Cherokee abandoned their Lower Towns in the Project area by 1785. The region developed into small farms, which eventually gave way to the development of the textile industry.

The Project area offers many natural attractions. In addition to beautiful Lake Keowee and Lake Jocassee, there is a vast range of rivers, lakes, waterfalls and forests. The 76-mile-long Foothills Trail that winds around and through the Blue Ridge Escarpment is a popular hiking spot. The trail connects Table Rock State Park and Oconee State Park. Also located in the area are Whitewater Falls, which is the highest cascade east of the Rockies, and Sassafras Mountain, which is the highest point in South Carolina.

The Project area has a rich complement of plant and animal species. The reservoirs and tributaries flowing into them have numerous species of fish and are well known for their valuable sportfishing opportunities. The lands adjacent to the Project provide great habitat for a rich variety of terrestrial animals including turkey, deer and black bears. The plant life is equally abundant and diverse with an incredible variety of trees, shrubs and wildflowers. One particular plant species of note is the rare and lovely Oconee Bell. First described by the French botanist André Michaux in 1787, the Oconee Bell contains pink and white blossoms and is found only in a few locations in this portion of the Blue Ridge Escarpment.

Lake Jocassee and Jocassee Pumped Storage Facility
The four-unit Jocassee Pumped Storage Facility is a 710-megawatt generating facility located in Pickens County, S.C. The commercial operation of units 1 and 2 began in 1973. Commercial operation of units 3 and 4 began in 1975.

The average annual generation from the Jocassee Development is 811,000 megawatt-hours and the pumping energy requirement is 988,000 megawatt-hours. When generating electricity, the facility works as a conventional hydroelectric station. However, the Jocassee Pumped Storage Facility can also reverse its turbines and pump back previously used water from Lake Keowee into Lake Jocassee. This allows Duke Energy to reuse the water to generate electricity at a later time. For more information, read How Do Pumped-Storage Hydro Plants Work?

Lake Jocassee’s full pond elevation is 1,100 feet above mean sea level (MSL) with a maximum licensed drawdown of 30 feet. At full pond, the surface area is approximately 7,980 acres with approximately 92 miles of shoreline. The Jocassee Dam is a zoned earth and rockfill structure approximately 385 feet high and 1,800 feet in length. The dam includes two circular structures with eight openings that direct water to the generating units.

Lake Jocassee also serves as the lower reservoir for the Bad Creek Pumped Storage Facility. When electricity is being generated at the Bad Creek Pumped Storage Facility, water stored in the upper Bad Creek reservoir is released into Lake Jocassee through an underwater opening or discharge portal. The portal is located on the Whitewater River arm of Lake Jocassee. During the refilling of the upper Bad Creek reservoir, the Bad Creek Pumped Storage Facility turbines are reversed to pump water back from Lake Jocassee into the upper Bad Creek reservoir. Bad Creek Pumped Storage Facility began operating in 1991; its FERC license expires in 2027.

Lake Keowee and Keowee Hydro
The 2-unit Keowee Hydro s a 157.5-megawatt conventional hydro generating plant located in Pickens County, S.C. Keowee Hydro began operating in 1971. The average annual generation from the Keowee Hydro is approximately 70,000 megawatt-hours. Lake Keowee’s full pond elevation is 800 feet above MSL. At full pond, the surface area of Lake Keowee is approximately 17,700 acres with approximately 388 miles of shoreline.

Lake Keowee was formed by constructing dams across the Keowee River and the Little River, creating a reservoir with two distinct halves. The Keowee Dam is a homogenous earthfill structure 170 feet high and 3,500 feet in length. The Little River Dam is a homogenous earthfill structure 150 feet high and 1,800 feet in length. The four saddle dikes (designated as A, B, C and D) range in height from 4 to 100 feet and are located on the Little River segment of the reservoir. The Little River portion of Lake Keowee is connected to the Keowee River side of Lake Keowee by an excavated canal.

In addition to providing hydroelectric power, Lake Keowee provides a crucial source for cooling water for Oconee Nuclear Station (ONS), a 2,538-MW nuclear power generating facility located adjacent to Keowee Hydro. Since Keowee Hydro also serves as one of the emergency power sources for ONS, it is operated by operators at ONS. This ensures that Keowee Hydro is fully available for emergencies at ONS.

Project Recreation
The Keowee-Toxaway Project provides many recreational opportunities for you to enjoy. Duke Energy has built numerous public access areas along the shorelines of both Lake Keowee and Lake Jocassee, opening the lakes to boating, camping – both primitive and RV – swimming and tournament-caliber fishing. Several state trout records have been set at Lake Jocassee.

Numerous recreational opportunities also abound outside of the water-based recreation at the Project reservoirs. The Project lies at the heart of 167,000 acres of state parks, game lands and national forests. Visitors can hunt the thousands of acres managed for public hunting and fishing, hike for days in pristine wilderness along the 76-mile long Foothills Trail, and view breathtaking vistas – including a view of Whitewater Falls, one of the highest cascades in eastern America.

In December 2008, Duke Energy filed a Recreation Management Plan (RMP) for the Project with FERC. Upon approval of the RMP by FERC, construction of the following additional recreational enhancements can begin:

Additional parking and restrooms
Courtesy docks
Additional picnic areas, some of which will be Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessible
Additional bank fishing, some of which will be ADA accessible
Walking trails
Shoreline Management Plan
Duke Energy has developed a Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) for both Lake Keowee and Lake Jocassee. Shoreline management planning is essential to protect and enhance the scenic, recreational, cultural and environmental values of the reservoirs. The SMP is a tool to guide responsible pier and marina construction, shoreline stabilization, excavation and other construction activities within the lake boundary. The purpose of the SMP is to provide continued public and private access while protecting the lake’s natural resources. The Shoreline Management Guidelines (SMG) is another tool used in combination with shoreline management plan maps to guide responsible use of the lakes. The SMG provides specific criteria for conducting many construction, stabilization and excavation activities within the lake boundary.

Recommendations
American Public Power Association (APPA)
2008-01-I-CO-17
Publish safety guidance addressing the hazards and controls for using hazardous materials including flammables in confined spaces and the unique hazards of penstocks. At a minimum

a. In controlling hazards in confined spaces, implement a hierarchy of controls by first attempting to eliminate hazards or substitute with a less hazardous material(s) or method(s). Examples include performing work outside of a confined space where reasonably practicable or substituting a flammable material with a non-flammable one.

b. Establish a maximum permissible percentage substantially below the LEL for safe entry and occupancy of permit-required confined spaces.

c. Recommend that confined spaces that are large, or part of a continuous system such as a penstock, always be managed as permit-required as defined in the OSHA Confined Space Standard, and that such spaces always be monitored for hazardous atmospheres both prior to entry and continuously in areas where work is being performed.

d. Ensure that evacuation plans for penstocks that have only one egress point provide for alternative escape routes or refuge chambers.

e. Provide guidance for implementing a written confined space rescue plan. Address staging and methods of rescue for each designated permit space including whether a rescue team is required to stand by outside the space. Require that confined space rescue teams be standing by at the permit spaces where the hazards pose an immediate threat to life or health, including the hazard of a potential flammable atmosphere.

Before BIGGS, MARIS, CLARK, JONES, and GOODRICH, Circuit Judges.
BIGGS, Circuit Judge.
We are here concerned with a petition to review an order of the Federal Power Commission issued by it on June 11, 1940 allegedly pursuant to Section 20, Part I of the Federal Power Act.[1] The petitioner, Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation, operates a hydroelectric power plant on the Susquehanna River at Safe Harbor, Pennsylvania, under a fifty year license issued to it in 1930 by the Federal Power Commission. Under a long term contract expiring in 1980, Safe Harbor sells all of the electrical energy created by it to its two parent companies, Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company, of Baltimore, at Baltimore, Maryland, and the Pennsylvania Water and Power Company, of Holtwood, Pennsylvania. The two last named companies own all of the stock of the petitioner. We will refer to the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company as the Maryland Company and The Pennsylvania Water and Power Company as the Pennsylvania Company. The Maryland Company and the Pennsylvania Company are entitled to take electric power from Safe Harbor in the direct proportion of their respective stock ownerships; viz., the Maryland Company is entitled to two-thirds and the Pennsylvania Company is entitled to one-third of the electrical energy produced. The Pennsylvania Company in turn sells the electric energy which it purchases to the Maryland Company and others at wholesale.[2] The greater part of the electricity created by Safe Harbor goes into interstate commerce. Though title to some of it passes from Safe Harbor to the Pennsylvania Company in Pennsylvania and is not in interstate commerce, we think that the assertion of the Federal Power Commission that the Safe Harbor hydroelectric project in Pennsylvania is operated as part of a large integrated interstate electric system is substantially correct. A goodly portion of the *803 electricity manufactured by Safe Harbor enters Maryland and the District of Columbia.[3]
The Commission fixed Safe Harbor's wholesale rate for electricity on the statutory rate base of net investment prescribed for licensees by Part I of the Act. The rate base was found by the Commission to be $27,863,000 and the Commission allowed a 6% rate of return thereon, amounting to the sum of $1,672,000 in annual earnings for Safe Harbor above operating expenses, taxes, depreciation and rate case expense. The Commission's order requires Safe Harbor to reduce its annual wholesale rate for electricity by about $350,000 annually.
The petitioner raises questions which fall under three heads. The first is: Has this court jurisdiction to review the rate order made by the Commission under Section 20? Second: Is the order of the Commission reducing the licensees' rates invalid because made without jurisdiction and in disregard of the provisions of Section 20 of Part I of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.A. § 813? Third: Assuming jurisdiction to be vested in the Commission to make the order complained of, are the terms of that order confiscatory, arbitrary, or based on insufficient evidence?
 
As to the Jurisdiction of This Court.
The Commission issued an order on July 23, 1940 denying rehearing of the cause. Upon September 10, 1940, Safe Harbor filed a petition for review in this court under Section 313(b), 16 U.S.C.A. § 825l(b), and a bill for an injunction in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming the United States and the individual members of the Commission as parties respondent pursuant to the provisions of Section 20 of the Federal Water Power Act of 1920, c. 285, 41 Stat. 1073, 16 U.S.C.A. § 813. The first question posed for our determination is whether this court or the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has jurisdiction to review the order of the Commission.
Section 313(b), 16 U.S.C.A. § 825l(b) provides that the aggrieved party to an order of the Commission may obtain a review of such order in the circuit court of appeals for the circuit wherein the licensee is located or has its principal place of business ""* * * by filing in such court, within sixty days after the order of the Commission upon the application for rehearing, a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part."" The subsection also states that upon the filing of the transcript the court of appeals to which the petition is filed shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify or set aside the order of the Commission. The transcript in the case at bar was filed in this court upon October 1, 1940.
Safe Harbor contends in respect to the complaint filed by it in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that because Section 20 of the Federal Water Power Act of 1920, 16 U.S.C.A. § 813, provides that the persons subject to regulation ""* * * shall have the same rights of hearing, defense, and review * * *"" as railroad companies under the Interstate Commerce Act which includes the right of review specified by the Urgent Deficiencies Act, October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 41 (subdivision 28), 43-48, the District Court possessed original jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, annul or suspend in whole or in part the order of the Commission. Safe Harbor further contends that the District Court should have been constituted as a three judge court precisely as if it were reviewing an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
We entertain no doubt as was stated by the learned District Judge in his opinion in this case, Safe Harbor Water Power Corp. v. United States, 37 F. Supp. 9, 10, that prior to the enactment of parts II and III of the Federal Power Act in 1935[4] the *804 District Court was the only forum available for the review of orders of the Federal Power Commission regulating rates. Section 313(b) of the 1935 Act, specifically provides for review of the orders of the Commission by the respective circuit courts of appeals. The District Court concluded that Section 313(b) did not repeal by implication the older review provisions of Section 20 and that an order of the Commission might be reviewed by the district court unless a certified transcript of the record before the Commission had been filed with the circuit court of appeals as in the case at bar. In the latter event, the district judge concluded, by reason of the provisions of Section 313(b) only the circuit court of appeals might review the order of the Commission. In short, the ruling of the court below was that while both the district court and the circuit court of appeals had jurisdiction to review an order of the Commission, the jurisdiction of the latter tribunal did not attach until a certified transcript of the proceedings before the Commission was filed with the circuit court of appeals and that when this was done the jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals became exclusive and that of the district court to review the Commission's order necessarily terminated.
While it is the law that repeals by implication are not looked on with favor, United States v. Jackson, 302 U.S. 628, 631, 58 S. Ct. 390, 82 L. Ed. 488, none the less, conflicts and inconsistencies between provisions of acts may necessitate such repeals. The conflict or inconsistency, however, must be plain and irreconcilable. United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 20 L. Ed. 153; United States v. State of California, 297 U.S. 175, 56 S. Ct. 421, 80 L. Ed. 567; H. Rouw Co. v. Crivella, 8 Cir., 105 F.2d 434; Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 56 S. Ct. 349, 80 L. Ed. 351. In the case at bar the District Court held that the review provisions of Section 20 and Section 313(b) presented no indissoluble conflict. But Section 313(b) provides that the courts of appeals shall have ""* * * exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside [the] * * * order [of the Commission] in whole or in part."" In Jackson v. Cravens, 5 Cir., 238 F. 117, 120, it was said that ""* * * where a statute provides a new, specific, and complete remedy, and fully covers the subject-matter, the provisions of the [later] statute will be looked to alone, and resort will not be had to prior existing general remedies as cumulative."" In the case at bar since Section 313(b) does provide a new and specific and complete remedy fully covering the subject matter, we conclude that the review given by the section just cited is ""exclusive"" and that the review provisions of Section 20 must be deemed to have been repealed by implication.
Two direct appeals were taken by Safe Harbor from the District Court to the Supreme Court; one was from the judgment dismissing the complaint entered by a single judge as distinguished from the judgment to like effect which might have been entered by a three judge court. The second appeal was from the order of the District Court refusing to vacate its judgment dismissing the complaint. The defendants argued before the Supreme Court that that tribunal had no jurisdiction upon direct appeal from the district court and, if the district judge's determination that the complaint did not state a cause of action requiring a three-judge court was correct, then the Supreme Court was without any appellate jurisdiction whatsoever.
The Supreme Court dismissed both appeals, Safe Harbor Water Power Corp. v. United States, 313 U.S. 546, 61 S. Ct. 1084, 1085, 85 L. Ed. 1512, and cited cases holding mandamus and not appeal to be the remedy when a three-judge should have been convened. It then referred to Section 313(b). If we are correct in our interpretation of this decision, we think that the Supreme Court intended to convey the thought that Section 313(b) deprived the district court of jurisdiction of the cause, but in arriving at such a conclusion the Supreme Court did not have to pass upon the question of repeal by implication of the review provisions of Section 20 by those of Section 313(b). We have ruled upon that question in order that there may be certainty in this circuit.
We affirm the judgment of the court below as the proper exercise by a single *805 district judge of the court's power to dismiss the complaint. This disposes of the appeal at No. 7688.
We dismiss the appeal at No. 7689, taken from the order of the court below refusing to vacate the judgment of dismissal, because that order is not appealable.
What we have stated in this part of our opinion disposes also of the question raised as to jurisdiction of this court of the appeal at No. 7544. This is the appeal which raises the main questions and accordingly we will proceed to rule upon the substantive questions of law involved.
 
As to the Jurisdiction of the Commission to Regulate the Rates Charged by Safe Harbor.
Did the Commission have jurisdiction under Section 20 to regulate the wholesale electric rates charged by Safe Harbor? We have indicated that the greater part of the electricity generated by the hydroelectric units operated by Safe Harbor goes from Pennsylvania into Maryland and therefore moves in interstate commerce. Congress possesses the authority to regulate the rates charged for such electricity. None the less there are two questions for our determination. The first is what was the intention of Congress. The second is could Congress do what it intended to do. We will endeavor to answer the first question first.
It must be borne in mind that Safe Harbor was licensed under Section 19 of the Act, 16 U.S.C.A. § 812, by the Federal Power Commission to operate its hydroelectric units upon the Susquehanna River. Without the license of the Commission the power company could not function at all. Section 19 provides as a condition of the issuance of the license that the licensee ""* * * shall abide by such reasonable regulation of the services to be rendered to customers or consumers of power, and of rates and charges of payment therefor, as may from time to time be prescribed by any duly constituted agency of the State in which the service is rendered or the rate charged."" It goes on to state that in case power created by the licensee is used in public service within a state which has not set up a commission empowered to regulate and control services and rates then ""it is agreed as a condition of such license"" that jurisdiction to regulate rates and services furnished by the licensee or by its customer is in the Commission which retains such regulatory power until the state has set up a commission for regulation.
In the case at bar regulation is sought by the Commission under the provisions of Section 20. The pertinent portions of Section 20 provide that: ""When said power or any part thereof shall enter into interstate or foreign commerce the rates charged and the service rendered by any such licensee, * * * or by any person, corporation, or association purchasing power from such licensee for sale and distribution or use in public service shall be reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and just to the customer and all unreasonable discriminatory and unjust rates or services are hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful; and whenever any of the States directly concerned has not provided a commission or other authority to enforce the requirements of this section within such State * * * or such States are unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the services to be rendered, or on the rates or charges of payment therefor * * * jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the commission, upon complaint of any person aggrieved, upon the request of any State concerned, or upon its own initiative to enforce the provisions of this section, to regulate and control so much of the services rendered, and of the rates and charges of payment therefor as constitute interstate or foreign commerce * * *.""
It will be observed how very similar in one major particular the provisions of Section 19 and 20 are. Regulation of power is to be encompassed through state authority and not through the power of the Federal government unless the state has failed to set up a regulatory commission. Only in the event of such failure does the Federal Power Commission possess jurisdiction to regulate rates and services.
It is contended by Safe Harbor that since Section 20 states that the Federal Power Commission shall have regulatory jurisdiction only when a state or states concerned ""has not provided a commission or other authority to enforce the requirements of this section within such State * * * or such States are unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the services to be rendered, or on the rates or charges of payment therefor * * *"", the contingency specified is not one growing out of the constitutional impotency of a *806 state to make its commission's actions effective, but rather the simple failure of a state to set up a regulatory agency. In other words if a state regulatory agency or state regulatory agencies have been set up it is immaterial whether or not the state agency or state agencies possess the constitutional power to deal with the regulation of hydroelectric power in interstate commerce unless they are unable to agree as to how they would regulate something in respect to which they are impotent.
This would be a curious emasculation of the statute. Congress intended the contrary and this is indicated from the words employed in Section 20, ""a commission or other authority to enforce * * * or to regulate and control * * *"". It was the intention of Congress that there should be regulation and control of hydroelectrical energy and not that impotent public bodies would be set up by the states to go through the motions of regulation. The petitioner's view in this regard is not supported by the legislative history of the section. Section 20 as originally submitted to Congress[5] did employ the words, ""* * * whenever the States directly concerned have not the authority individually to take action or are unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities * * *"", subsequently stricken out in favor of the present words of the Section, but the debates and reports[6] indicate quite clearly that Congress proposed in fact to regulate hydroelectric power and not make vain gestures of regulation.
The question is whether Congress intended to regulate interstate commerce in hydroelectric power by the Federal Power Commission or through the medium of state commissions. Put thus baldly, the first reaction might be that Congress intended to regulate interstate commerce in hydroelectric energy by a federal agency leaving to the state commissions intrastate regulation. But such a conclusion flies in the face of the words of Section 20. The section is expressly intended for the regulation of hydroelectric power which ""shall enter into interstate or foreign commerce"". It speaks of the states ""directly concerned"" and of states directly concerned being ""unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the services to be rendered, or on the rates or charges of payment therefor * * *"". Moreover, the debates and reports show that the members of Congress were thinking in terms of state regulation of interstate hydroelectric power. Senator LaFollette, a member of the special Water Power Committee, stated, Congressional Record, Vol. 56, Part 9, p. 8932, ""The only place where the government interferes between the States is where they have not any commission, and if there is any charge of monopoly usually it is the fault of the State and not the fault of this law or the Commission."" The use of the phrase ""between the States"" is particularly indicative of what was in the mind of Senator LaFollette. See also the statement of Representative Lee, who said, Congressional Record, 66th Cong. 2nd Sess., Vol. 59, Part 7, p. 6528: ""The bill provides that the regulation of rates, of service, and of issuance of securities shall be exercised by the several states whenever they have established agencies with the necessary authority."" The emphasis here is again on agencies of states, indicating clearly the thought that hydroelectric energy would pass from one state to another and be regulated in the states by the states.
We conclude that it was the intention of Congress to regulate hydroelectric power by state commissions using the federal agency set up in Section 20 only where the state commissions did not or could not perform the function expected of them.
Could Congress provide for the regulation of hydroelectric power coming into the states in interstate commerce by state commissions? This is the vital question for our determination, but before it can be answered another inquiry must be made. Are the generation, transmission and consumption of hydroelectric energy matters of such national concern as to require regulation solely by the Federal government? This question is capable of being answered either in the affirmative or in the negative, depending on circumstances. The transmission of power from state to state may be such a matter of national concern as to require regulation solely by a Federal agency, while on the other hand the consumption of that power in the state to which it has been transmitted may be purely *807 a matter of local interest. The principle of Public Utilities Comm. v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co., 273 U.S. 83, 47 S. Ct. 294, 71 L. Ed. 549, would govern the first situation; that of Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., 252 U.S. 23, 40 S. Ct. 279, 64 L. Ed. 434, the second. Section 19 deals with the development, transmission and distribution of power in public service. Section 20 concerns itself primarily with regulation and control of services and rates within a state of hydroelectric power which has entered that state through interstate commerce. It deals also with regulation of such power through state compact, reserving jurisdiction to the Federal Power Commission where the state authorities are in disagreement.
There is no doubt that Congress cannot delegate the power of the central government to regulate interstate commerce to a state or state agency. It should also be borne in mind that in the case at bar we need not concern ourselves with the doctrine of the silence of Congress[7] for Congress has spoken in Section 20. When Congress enacted Section 20 in 1920 it had before it the decision of the Supreme Court in the Pennsylvania Gas Co. case. When Congress reenacted the Section in 1935, the Supreme Court had decided not only State of Missouri v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 265 U.S. 298, 44 S. Ct. 544, 68 L. Ed. 1027, but the Attleboro case as well. But there always has been a field where, Congress permitting, the police powers of the states might operate. Examples of this are manifold. This has been true in many cases even where state action apparently has been in conflict with Congressional action[8] and the Supreme Court has held none the less that there remains a regulatory field in which the state may act. A cogent illustration lies in the decision of the Supreme Court in Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Md. Ry. Co., 242 U.S. 311, 325-332, 37 S. Ct. 180, 61 L. Ed. 326, L.R.A.1917 B, 1218, Ann.Cas.1917B, 845, passing upon the application of the Webb-Kenyon Law, 37 Stat. 699, 27 U.S.C.A. § 122, which held in effect that Congress might throw an interstate shipment of intoxicating liquors into intrastate commerce as it passed the state line, the use to which the shipment was then to be put becoming a matter of local concern and the police power of West Virginia operating in respect to it. There is an analogy between the Clark Distilling case and that at bar for the consumption of power is a local matter, almost as if a package of power had been delivered at the state line. The case at bar, however, is a stronger case for the exercise of state police power for in the instant case Congress has spoken and specifically has given permission for the exercise of state power. There is a field in which state power may act upon the products of interstate commerce and though that field is difficult to delimit we think that Congress intended to base Section 20 upon it and could do so without violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. Indeed, if only one state or one state agency was concerned in the case at bar, we would conclude that the decision of the Supreme Court in the Pennsylvania Gas Co. rather than that of the Attleboro case was governing.
In the instant case it is necessary to go one step further, however. While the Public Service Commission of Maryland within the doctrine of the Pennsylvania Gas Co. case can regulate the rates and services charged for the hydroelectric energy generated by Safe Harbor and consumed in Maryland or delivered at the district line at Takoma Park for the District of Columbia, and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission likewise can regulate electrical energy designed for consumption in Pennsylvania, it is obvious that there must be cooperation and agreement between these two state authorities if there is to be a really effective regulation of rates and services for the hydroelectric energy with which we are concerned. In short the power generated by Safe Harbor and used in Pennsylvania and Maryland must be treated as an integrated whole. Otherwise either state commission might impose unreasonable regulations or service schedules for the benefit of their respective citizens. The compact clause, clause 3 of Section 10 of Article I of the Constitution of the United States, affords the opportunity to the respective state commissions of Pennsylvania and Maryland to regulate under their police powers these rates and services as part of an integrated system of hydroelectric energy. We think that this was what Congress *808 intended when it enacted Section 20, and with the permission thus accorded, the two states concerned are at liberty to regulate these rates and services constitutionally and lawfully. Such a result is in line with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Pennsylvania Gas Co. case.
Section 20 conveys the consent of Congress to the states to make agreements of cooperation under the compact clause. They may so act under it. The subject matter of such a cooperative compact is one in which ""* * * Congress must exercise national supervision through its power to grant or withhold consent, or to grant it under appropriate conditions.""[9] The foregoing quotation contains the essence of what we have stated heretofore. In the case at bar in the absence of a finding by the Federal Power Commission that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland ""* * * are unable to agree through their properly constituted authorities on the services to be rendered, or on the rates or charges of payment therefor * * *"", jurisdiction to regulate remains in the state commissions of those states and is not in the Federal Power Commission.
Congress made the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission to regulate hydroelectric energy under Part I of the Federal Power Act dependent upon the inability of the states concerned with the electric energy to agree upon its regulation. Such an agreement would be a compact. The word ""compact"" is high-sounding and usually associated with an extensive body of official formulas, but we conclude that a compact like an agreement may be deemed to arise out of actions which are quite informal, Chief Justice Taney in the case of Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 572, 614, 10 L. Ed. 579, 595, 618, indicated this when he stated, ""* * * we can be at no loss to comprehend the intention of the framers of the Constitution in using all these words, `treaty,' `compact,' `agreement.' The word `agreement,' does not necessarily import any direct and express stipulation; nor is it necessary that it should be in writing. If there is a verbal understanding, to which both parties have assented, and upon which both are acting, it is an `agreement.' And the use of all of these terms, `treaty,' `agreement,' `compact,' show that it was the intention of the framers of the constitution to use the broadest and most comprehensive terms; * * *."" If Pennsylvania and Maryland, through their respective public service commissions, have agreed informally, by cooperative or identical actions, to regulate as an integrated stream of electricity the hydroelectric energy produced by Safe Harbor and consumed in Pennsylvania and Maryland, we would conclude that such would be within the purview of the compact clause and the permission given by Congress by Section 20. The record in the case at bar is silent upon the specific subject of joint regulation by the state commissions of Pennsylvania and Maryland but does show regulation by these commissions over a period of years. Such regulation may have been by cooperative action between these state commissions and may constitute the reason why the Federal Power Commission made no finding that the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland by their respective commissions were unable to agree on the services to be rendered by the power company or on the rates or charges of payment therefor.
In reaching these conclusions we are not unmindful of the Report to Congress made by the Federal Power Commission in which an opinion of the Chief Counsel to the Secretary of the Commission reaches an opposite result.[10] Though we think that the opinion of the Commission and its counsel is entitled to great weight, we are unable to agree with the views expressed by the Commission in the case at bar in respect to the application of Section 20. Though Congress had the opinion before it in 1935 when the Federal Power Act was passed, the Commission's views on this subject (if they were as are now asserted by the Commission) had not been enforced by actual order and for this reason represented theory rather than practice. We conclude that this portion of the Report cannot be given the same weight as if it furnished a specific ruling put in practice by the Commission.
*809 In conclusion we state that whether or not the Federal Power Commission has jurisdiction over Safe Harbor as a public utility transmitting and selling electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce under the provisions of Part II of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.A. § 824 et seq., is immaterial. The Commission has chosen to fix the rates charged by Safe Harbor under the authority which Section 20 confers upon it with respect to licensees of water power projects upon navigable rivers which is an entirely different basis for Federal jurisdiction. Regulation of electrical energy created by boiling water, carboelectrical energy, and regulation of electrical energy created by falling water, hydroelectrical energy, present a subject for reflection under the respective provisions of Parts I and II of the Federal Power Act, but are not properly in this case.
In view of what we have decided it is unnecessary to pass upon the third question presented by the appeal: Whether or not the Commission's order is confiscatory, arbitrary, or based on insufficient evidence.
The order of the Federal Power Commission is set aside as beyond its jurisdiction.

Rangit Dam (Hindi: रन्गीत् बाँध Bāndh), which forms the headworks of the Rangit Hydroelectric Power Project Stage III, is a run-of-the-river hydroelectric power project on the Ranjit River, a major tributary of the Teesta River in the South Sikkim district of the Northeastern Indian state of Sikkim. The project's construction was completed in 1999. The project is fully functional since 2000. The project was built at a cost of Rs 4922.6 million (Rs 492.26 crores) (at US$1 = Rs 45, this is US$109.39 million).[1] The average annual power generation from the 60 MW (3x20 MW) project is 340 GWh with firm power of 39 MW.[1][2][3][4][5]
Topography[edit]
Left: Confluence of Rangeet River and Rathong chu rivers upstream of the Rangit Dam. Right: A chorten above the confluence of the two rivers
The Ranjit River on which the Rangit Dam is located, is a major right bank tributary of the Teesta River in Sikkim. The river arises from the Talung glacier and it meets the Teesta river at Melli after a travel of 61 kilometres (38 mi) from its source. At the dam site, the catchment area drained is 979.02 square kilometres (378.00 sq mi) (rain-fed catchment is 712 square kilometres (275 sq mi) and the balance area is snow fed above snow line contour of (4,570 metres (14,990 ft)); elevation of the catchment area varies from about 600 metres (2,000 ft) to about 7,338 metres (24,075 ft) (North Kabru Peak) and is delimited between (27.275°N 88.0141°E) and (27.6195°N 88.42°E). A number of perennial streams originate in glacial fields of the river basin; important snow-fed rivers which constitute the Rangit basin above the dam site are the Rathong Chu, Rimbi Chu, Prek Chu, Ralli Chu, Rongdon Chu and Kayam Chu. The drainage pattern is sub-dendentric.[6]
The dam is located at a distance of 130 kilometres (81 mi) from Siliguri and70 kilometres (43 mi) from Gangtok. The dam is located downstream of the confluence of Rathong Chu and Rangit Rivers near the Legship town and the powerhouse of the project is located near Sagbari village.[2][3]
Hydrology[edit]
The annual inflow in the river at the location of the dam has been estimated as 696,000 cubic metres. The maximum flood discharge has been adopted as 3,395 cubic metres (119,900 cu ft)/s while the design flood discharge adopted for the spillway of the dam is 2,725 cubic metres (96,200 cu ft)/sec. The dependable discharge adopted for diversion from the reservoir for power generation is 1717.8 cubic metres (630 cu ft)/s (without considering contribution from the upstream Stage II project, which is yet to be implemented).[2][3]
Climate[edit]
The climate of the Rangit River basin is cold and humid. The climatic seasons of the basin represented in the project area are: spring season-late February, summer season-March, premonsoon showers-April and May; monsoon season May to September, sometimes extending to October. The snow season, at higher elevations of the catchment falls between December and February. Winters are very cold with mist and fog lasting from November to February.[6]
Geology[edit]
Precambrian formations of the Daling series of quartzites and phyllites dominate the area. This rock type is overlain by crystalline Darjeeling Gneiss comprising gneisses and granitoides. Recent alluvium of sandy loam, silty loam and clayey material of varying thickness overlay the rock formations. The banks of the Rangit River depict silty clay material with large rock blocks. Many land slides are observed in the catchment, which add to the siltation problems of the reservoir.[6]
Project features[edit]
Aerial View of Ranjit Dam and appurtenant works
The Rangit dam is 45 metres (148 ft) high concrete gravity structure of 100 metres (330 ft) length. The reservoir created behind the dam has a storage capacity of 1,175,000 cubic metres. The storage created is utilized for hydropower generation at a surface Powerhouse located on the left bank of the Rangit River. The diversion of flow from the reservoir to the surface Powerhouse is effected through an Intake leading to a concrete lined Head Race Tunnel (HRT) of 4.5 metres (15 ft) diameter (Horse shoe shaped and concrete lined) of 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) length, a Surge Shaft (14 metres (46 ft) diameter and of 60 metres (200 ft) depth at the end of the HRT with control arrangement followed by one main penstock pipe (of 3.5 metres (11 ft) diameter and length of 270 metres (890 ft)) trifurcating into three lines of 2 metres (6.6 ft) diameter each (with a total length of all three lines is 59 metres (194 ft)) to connect to the three Francis Turbine Generating Units of 20 MW capacity each, through the MIVs. The tailwaters from the turbines are led back into the river through a combined short tailrace channel. The firm power generation is of the order of 39 MW corresponding to annual energy generation of 340 GWh (in a 90% dependable year). The ruling levels for power generation are: in the reservoir, Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of 639 metres (2,096 ft) and Minimum Draw Down Level (MDDL) of 627 metres (2,057 ft)), the Normal Tail Water Level (NTWL) in the Tail Race Channel from the Powerhouse of 512 m and under an operating gross head of 127 m.[2][3][4] Since it is owned by coastal projects ltd, the power generated is shared and Sikkim gets a share of 13.33%.[7]
The project was funded by the Government of India and built by its parastatal organization namely, the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC). The construction of the project was completed in December 1999 and operation started in January 2000. Operation and maintenance of the project is also with the NHPC.[2]
This power project was the third stage of the five-stage cascade development conceived on the main stem of the Rangit River, and was the first to be built in the series of Rangit Stage I to IV initially conceived by the Central Water Commission. Three other projects on the Rangit River planned and under development are the Rangit Stage II (60 MW capacity), Rangit Stage IV (3×40 MW = 120 MW capacity) and Jorethong HEP (96 MW); the last two projects are now under construction.[8][9][10]
Environmental aspects[edit]

In river valley reservoir projects, the gravity of the siltation problem induced due to catchment degradation is serious and needs to be suitably addressed. For this purpose, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India have made it obligatory for the project authorities to implement physical engineering and biological measures in the catchment area of the project to be taken up pari passu (concurrently) with the implementation of the Hydropower project. This activity involves several works defined under the 'Catchment Area Treatment' (CAT) plan.[11]
For evolving the CAT plan, the status of the reservoir catchment was analysed. The reservoir catchment consists of five types of forests namely, the East Himalayan Sub-Tropical wet hill forests (elevation range of 800–1,800 metres (2,600–5,900 ft)), East Himalayan wet temperate forests (elevation range of 1,800–2,700 metres (5,900–8,900 ft)), Oak and Rhododendron forests (elevated above 2,700 metres (8,900 ft)), mixed coniferous forests (in elevation range of 2,700–3,750 metres (8,860–12,300 ft)) and alpine scrubs/pastures (above 3,750 metres (12,300 ft)). There are 35 reserve forests in the catchment, out of which 29 are in West Sikkim district and six (6) are in South Sikkim district. The entire catchment area was analysed in detail to assess the degraded areas to be treated under the CAT plan to reduce siltation problems. An area of 13,075 hectares (32,310 acres)) was identified for implementing engineering and biological treatment measures. These measures were implemented, starting with 1995–96, by the Forest Department of the Government of Sikkim involving engineering treatment measures (included agricultural land, forest land and water land) and biological treatment measures. 15 nurseries were established covering an area of 18.5 hectares (46 acres)) to provide saplings/seedlings for plantation in the sub-watersheds of the catchment identified for treatment.[12]
Recreation[edit]
The reservoir created by the Rangit dam has been developed into a recreational water park named 'Rangit Water World'. It is a popular venue for picnics, fishing, boating and rafting. The recreational centre was developed due to the initiative of the local people of Legship town.[13][14]

Devil's Gate
Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant, Weber Canyon
By Amber Bell, Weber State University
Devil's Gate Source: ""Water Power Plant P. 2."" n.d. No.2610. Used by permission, Utah State Historical Society. https://collections.lib.utah.edu/ark:/87278/s64q835h.
The Weber Hydroelectric power plant has been in operation in 1910. Despite decreased usage, the plant continues to provide power to the local grid.
Devil’s Gate-Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant is located in Weber Canyon. The power station was completed in 1910 on the Weber River. Crowded between steep, winding canyon walls alongside the Union Pacific Railroad and Interstate 84, the plant has stood for over 100 years.
The conservation movement at the turn of the century was a scientific movement focused on rational planning to increase efficient use of all natural resources. Dams were a solution to making water usage more efficient. Dams conserve water for agriculture and municipal needs as well as provide flood control and electricity. This was the Progressive Era’s ideal approach to managing water resources. Ogden and Salt Lake City were rapidly industrializing at the end of the 1800s with the construction of railroads and and better public transportation. However, an efficient power grid was needed to maintain these advances. Thus, Devil’s Gate was a vital component to support a well-organized system for Ogden and Salt Lake City. 
During construction, a conflict with the Union Pacific Railroad almost prevented Devil’s Gate from being built. C. K. Bannister, an engineer involved in the construction of the Pioneer hydroelectric plant in Ogden Canyon, began work on Devil’s Gate in 1900. However, with the railroad next to the Weber River, Union Pacific Railroad officials were concerned a dam would damage the railbed and temporarily halted the dam's progress. Bannister died before work resumed, and his associates, Thomas D. Dee and David Eccles, sold the property rights to the Utah Light and Railway Company. Around the same time, the president of the Union Pacific Railroad, Edward Henry Harriman, purchased sixty-percent of Utah Light and Railway Company’s stocks, thus gaining majority control of the firm. Harriman intended to upgrade the Northern Wasatch Front’s electrical output to make it efficient for his electric streetcar operation in Salt Lake City. Unable to acquire more water rights in Ogden Canyon to improve the Pioneer plant, Harriman authorized the construction of Devil’s Gate with the stipulation that precautions be taken to protect the railroad embankment from potential erosion. Construction on the dam was completed two years later. 
With the rapid urbanization of the Wasatch Front at the end of the 1800s, several small power companies sprung up, creating intense competition. This led to corporate consolidations and larger power grids. Devil’s Gate was completed in 1910 and was one of the first power plants in Utah intended to feed an electrical grid. Previously, power plants adjusted their output based on the local daily or seasonal needs, but Devil’s Gate would run continuously at full capacity to meet the needs of the overall system powering all of Salt Lake City and Ogden, including Salt Lake City’s electric streetcars. In 1914, ownership of Devil’s Gate passed into the private hands of Utah Light and Traction, who lost all of its power stations to the Utah Power and Light Company in 1915. 
Under the ownership of the Utah Power and Light Company, several modifications were made to Devil’s Gate to increase its electrical capacity and efficiency. In 1989 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. It still functions within a power grid today, but its role is far smaller due to the construction of larger dams which surpass Devil’s Gate electrical output.

  (A) An electric distribution utility or electric services company may use, for the purpose of complying with the requirements under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code, renewable energy credits any time in the five calendar years following the date of their purchase or acquisition from any entity, including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) A mercantile customer;
(2) An owner or operator of a hydroelectric generating facility that is located at a dam on a river, or on any water discharged to a river, that is within or bordering this state or within or bordering an adjoining state, or that produces power that can be shown to be deliverable into this state;
(3) A seller of compressed natural gas that has been produced from biologically derived methane gas, provided that the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered amounts of gas.
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules specifying that one unit of credit shall equal one megawatt hour of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except that, for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or greater that is situated within this state and has committed by December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or units to enable the facility to generate principally from biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall equal, in units of credit, the product obtained by multiplying the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to generate such megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing the then existing unit dollar amount used to determine a renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division (C)(2)(b) of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but such megawatt hour shall not equal less than one unit of credit. Renewable energy resources do not have to be converted to electricity in order to be eligible to receive renewable energy credits. The rules shall specify that, for purposes of converting the quantity of energy derived from biologically derived methane gas to an electricity equivalent, one megawatt hour equals 3,412,142 British thermal units.
(2) The rules also shall provide for this state a system of registering renewable energy credits by specifying which of any generally available registries shall be used for that purpose and not by creating a registry. That selected system of registering renewable energy credits shall allow a hydroelectric generating facility to be eligible for obtaining renewable energy credits and shall allow customer-sited projects or actions the broadest opportunities to be eligible for obtaining renewable energy credits.
(C) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying solar resource as defined in section 3706.40 of the Revised Code is not eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section for any megawatt hour for which the resource has been issued a solar energy credit under section 3706.45 of the Revised Code.
(D) Except for compressed natural gas that has been produced from biologically derived methane gas, energy generated by using natural gas as a resource is not eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section.

Fall View Park will be closed for the afternoon on Tuesday, June 20th for National Grid work. 

Cohoes Falls View Park
The four-acre Falls View Park is located adjacent to Brookfield’s School Street Hydroelectric Plant on North Mohawk Street in Cohoes, New York. The park offers a view of the scenic Cohoes Falls that spans the Mohawk River between Cohoes and Waterford, New York. Visitors to Falls View Park can now enjoy a wide range of recreational and historical features from areas never before open to the public.

Whether you enjoy fishing, hiking or taking photographs of the Falls, each visit will define a new experience. Falls View Park is a carry in/carry out park, open to the public from May 1 through November 1, from 7:00am-7:30pm. The park is staffed by a full-time park steward. Dogs are not allowed. Off street parking is available to visitors.

Background
Since its unveiling on August 21, 2008, Falls View Park has become a point of pride for the City of Cohoes and Brookfield. It also marks a unique public/private collaboration between Brookfield, the City of Cohoes and the National Park Service’s Erie Canalway Heritage Corridor.
Thousands of visitors gather annually at the park’s upper and lower levels to enjoy spectacular views of the Cohoes Falls.

Upper Level
Visitors to Falls View Park can enjoy easy access to a variety of amenities contained in the park’s upper level:

• A two-bus drop-off area on North Mohawk Street;
• Park entrance, off street parking and informational kiosk, also located along North Mohawk Street;
• A 192-foot pedestrian bridge that brings visitors into the heart of the park is topped with IPÊ wood, a strong, dense wood, harvested only from naturally sustainable forests;
• Interpretive panels and signage highlight the historical, educational and geological significance of the Cohoes Falls, Mohawk River and other nearby points of interest; and
• An 80-person amphitheater, picnic area and fishing platforms – all Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-compliant.

Lower Level
Additions to the park’s lower level were revealed at a public celebration hosted by Brookfield in May 2010. The Lower Level of the Park is open during regular Falls View Park hours, 7 AM to Dusk. Visitors to the lower level, accessed via a steep stairway, will find:

• Fishing platform and viewing deck at the back of the hydropower plant’s powerhouse.
Please also note that the descent and ascent to the lower level by the stairway can be physically strenuous for some individuals.


Riverbed Access
For your safety, access to the riverbed is closed to visitors. Please remember to observe any alarms or warnings from the park personnel.

Fast Rising Waters: The Mohawk River drains an area of more than 3,450 miles above Cohoes Falls. Distant storms and snowmelt send torrents down the river even when conditions are bright and sunny here. Upstream canal and powerplant operations can raise water levels rapidly, and unpredictably.

Deep Channels: There are sudden deep drop-offs and fast moving water across the base of the falls and in the center channel.

Rough and Slippery Footing: Floods and debris that course down the Mohawk several times every year scour holes in bedrock, rearrange gravel, uproot trees, and coat rocks with slippery silt.

Falling Rock: The Greywacke shale of the lower Mohawk gorge is soft and somewhat unstable.

Brookfield Renewable maintains Falls View Park; for additional information or questions, please contact Mark Luciano at (518) 636-1455 or by email  

Don't Forget...
Cohoes Overlook Park
For those wishing to find a year-round view of the Falls, visit Brookfield’s Overlook Park adjacent to the hydroelectric facility on School Street.  Visitors can enjoy an overlook view of the Cohoes Falls or have an afternoon picnic at this spectacular attraction. No visit to Cohoes is complete without taking in a view of the Cohoes Falls.

Abstract
THE exploitation of hydro-electric power in Canada continues to make substantial progress, and as will be seen from the graph reproduced in Fig. 1, from a report1 recently issued by the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau; the rate of development, despite the stagnation in trade, has not perceptibly slackened since the pronounced upward trend set in some fifteen years ago. Although no new large water power undertakings were initiated during 1934, the continuation of work on a number of installations previously under construction led to the completion of new installations aggregating 214,965 horse-power, which were brought into operation during the year. The total installation for the Dominion at the end of 1934 was 7,547,035 horse-power.

Manatee Viewing Center
MANATEE VIEWING CENTER
The fan-atees have spoken!
The Manatee Viewing Center has just been selected as one of the USA TODAY 10Best Readers’ Choice travel awards for best free attractions. Congratulations to the manatees, sharks, rays, butterflies and other wildlife – and the hardworking humans, too – who contributed to this honor. And thanks to all our fan-atees for voting for us.
  Hello, Human! Come visit us at Tampa Electric’s Manatee Viewing Center!
Manatees love warm water. And by a stroke of POWERful luck, Tampa Electric can provide it to them! Our Big Bend Power Station in Apollo Beach circulates water from Tampa Bay for cooling, then sends the water flowing clean and warm back into the bay. In the winter months the manatees leave colder waters to return to this warm and welcoming refuge.
Because of this uniquely unusual migration, we’ve built the Manatee Viewing Center so everyone could have a chance to see manatees gather. Our discharge canal is a state and federally designated manatee sanctuary that provides critical protection from the cold for these unique, gentle animals.
Location: 6990 Dickman Rd., Apollo Beach, FL 33572
Hours: Open daily from November 1 - April 15, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Trails close at 4 p.m. We are closed Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and Easter. Have questions? Call us at 813-228-4289.
Tampa Electric is proud to offer free parking and admission to all who visit!
Have a large group? Please let us know by sending a group reservation.
Snouts up - the manatees are the star of the show, but there’s much more to see and learn! The Manatee Viewing Center is just one part of the Florida Conservation & Technology Center. Guests can download this map into the free Avenza map application to see their exact location on the FCTC campus.

Florida’s Gentle Giants
At Tampa Electric’s Manatee Viewing Center, there is a lot to see and do! Visitors can wander along boardwalks overlooking the warm-water area where manatees gather; visit a newly remodeled education center to learn about the plant-eating, warm-blooded “gentle giants;” and even get a bite to eat at the Southshore Café.
Manatees often swim in water less than six-feet deep, where underwater vegetation is most abundant. Sadly, this makes them susceptible to boat strikes. Scientists estimate there are about 6,000 manatees in Florida's waters, and they need our help!
Check To See If Manatees Are At The Center Using Our Live Webcams!
The Manatee Viewing Center Webcam East and Webcam West, sit high above the center's gardens and boardwalks and are operational through the end of the center's open season on April 15. Take control of the camera to explore. When the water temperature drops below 68 degrees Fahrenheit you're likely to see many manatees!
Note: You have two minutes to use the camera before control goes to the next in line. If no one else is line, you will be able to control the camera until the next request. You can direct the camera's focus by clicking on the spot within the camera's viewscreen.
Please allow a moment for the camera controls to respond to your commands.
Tidal Walk
A featured part of the Great Florida Birding Trail, the Manatee Viewing Center's tidal walk offers more than just vibrant birdlife – it’s also one of the best spots to view manatees! On this 900-foot, ADA-compliant walkway you’ll see a variety of native coastal plants and trees, as well as animal life. At the end of the walkway, you can view manatees in Big Bend Power Station's clean, warm water discharge canal.
Make Way for Rays!
Manatees aren't the only creatures you can see up close at Tampa Electric's Manatee Viewing Center – there’s also a Rays Touch Tank.
The tank, part of a partnership with the Florida Aquarium, is the off-season home of the actual mascots of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays. It offers a fascinating look at cownose rays swimming just inches away, lightly grazing your fingertips as they glide past.
Trails and Tower
Connected to the Manatee Viewing Center is a coastal habitat trail that winds eight-tenths of a mile through saltern, coastal high marsh and coastal strand habitats. It showcases a variety of plant and animal life, immersing visitors in a peaceful, natural Florida setting. Additional trails and boardwalks connect you to all of the Florida Technology and Conservation Center.
Halfway along the habitat trail is a boardwalk that takes you to our wildlife observation tower. Marvel at the surrounding habitat, including the estuary below, from a 50-foot-high vantage point. On clear days, you can see all the way across Tampa Bay! Bring a picnic lunch to enjoy at one of the tables at the base of the tower. We have solar tables throughout the trails where you can relax under the shade of the solar panels while charging your phone or other electronics.
Education Building
Inside the environmental education building, colorful displays immerse you in the world of the manatee and its habitat. Inspect actual manatee bones and piece together puzzles. Meander through a mangrove tunnel, drift along a seagrass bed and take a dive into a spring. You can also learn about a few of our local manatees. Come face to face, or we should say snout to snout, with the dangers manatees face and learn how we can help protect these marvelous mammals!
Volunteer
With so many excited visitors, our volunteer docents are a critical part of the Manatee Viewing Center’s operation. Many of our docents have been with us for more than 10 years, returning season after season. Being a docent at the Manatee Viewing Center is a rewarding experience, in a uniquely beautiful and fun location!

If you would like to volunteer, we ask that you commit at least one day a week for four hours for the duration of the center's season (November 1 - April 15). If interested, just send us an email from our contact us page (be sure to select Manatee Viewing Center in the pull-down box). Interested docents age 18 and older are welcome to apply.

Hydropower: Environmental Benefits
Hydropower is better for the environment than other major sources of electrical power, which use fossil fuels. Hydropower plants do not emit the waste heat and gases—common with fossil-fuel driven facilities—which are major contributors to air pollution, global warming and acid rain. The mining and drilling required to acquire fossil fuels for other power sources also have a significant negative environmental impact.
Many hydropower plants are located in the headwaters of river basins where they can help control the wide fluctuations in water flow commonly found in these areas. By increasing water flow during dry months these projects help to enhance aquatic habitats. Conversely, by reducing flow during periods of heavy runoff the plants can prevent damage to vegetation and wildlife along stream banks.
However, hydropower projects and the dams associated with them do change the natural river environment, and there is often a price to pay for these changes. USACE works closely with natural resources agencies to minimize the negative environmental impact of all of its hydropower projects.
For instance, in the southeastern states, dissolved oxygen levels below dams often get so low that aquatic life is severely affected. USACE is working to improve dissolved oxygen levels at these facilities by using aerating turbines and injecting oxygen directly into the streamflow.
Over time the public has come to realize that we need a balance between improving our immediate daily environment and in preserving the natural environment around us. The USACE response is a concerted effort to mitigate dam and reservoir impacts to make the operation of these projects more compatible with the environment. USACE is constantly striving to strike the appropriate balance between the nation's need for a clean, inexpensive, efficient power source and environmental concerns.

The Folsom Powerhouse
The Folsom Powerhouse
Prepared by: Daniel A. Bell, Associate State Archaeologist
              
Abstract
The Folsom Powerhouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (1981) as being significant in the areas of engineering and industry on the national level. It has been said that it represented a momentous advance in the science of generating and transmitting electricity. In 1895 the facility brought high-voltage alternating current over long distance transmission lines for the first time. It is also a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark (1975), a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark (1976) and is designated as California Registered Historical Landmark No. 633 (1958).

Historic Setting
The Folsom Powerhouse, located on the west bank of the American River, may have seen more than one American or Canadian fur trapper in the 1830s and 1840s. While habitat for fur-bearing animals best suited for the fur trade was farther up stream, the gently sloping, thinly wooded terrain for the Folsom Powerhouse environs made it preferable for transportation by foot traffic and pack animals. There is no evidence that this was an often- used campsite by trappers, but it is likely that many passed this way.

The Gold Rush, as it did in so many other places in California, changed this dramatically. There is no documentation found so far that verifies gold mining at this particular location as early as 1848. However, it has been established that miners were working all along the stretch of the American River by late summer of that year. In 1849, the mining camp of Negro Bar was formed on the river terrace, just downstream from where the powerhouse is today. A few of the town's buildings may have been located this far up-river, but no features or historical documentation clearly indicates their presence. There are placer mining features within the powerhouse project area that pre-date the hydroelectric plant's construction; but so far, no evidence has been found indicating whether they date as far back as the period when Negro Bar was in existence (1849-1854). Placer gold mining in this general area of the American River was a continuous activity for more than 50 years after James Marshall's discovery.

In 1856 the first railroad West of the Mississippi, was established between Sacramento and the new town of Folsom. The California Central Railroad's (CCRR) track skirted the site of the future powerhouse on the east, roughly following the route of present-day Riley Street and Leidesdorff Street. A substantial railroad trestle crossed the American River at about where the Rainbow Bridge is today. The Sacramento Valley Railroad (SVRR) endeavored to create a rail link between the rapidly growing river city and the gold mining towns of the central foothills. The SVRR built shops (substantial buildings made of brick) and a rail yard in Folsom, also near the present location of the powerhouse. Keeping up with the region's expanding economy and population, the CCRR constructed a rail line between Folsom and Lincoln, just west of Auburn, in 1861. The Central Pacific Railroad acquired the CCRR, and removed its tracks between Folsom and Roseville in 1868.
Powerhouse History
Gold mining had created the town of Folsom, and indirectly lead to the construction of the Folsom Powerhouse. The man who first sought to harness the American River for generating power for industrial purposes came to California in 1850 following the lure of gold. By the early 1860s, Horatio Gates Livermore had gained control of the Natoma Water and Mining Company, a firm that had built a network of dams, ditches, and reservoirs that supplied water to the numerous gold mines in the American River area. Looking beyond the immediate service to these mines, Livermore hoped to apply waterpower to operating a sawmill and other industries in and around Folsom. In the mid 1860s, he started construction on a dam to provide a holding pond for the logs cut in the higher foothills, and sent down the river. This task was more formidable than he had anticipated, since labor costs would be so expensive for quarrying the stone and building the dam and system of canals and ditches. The Natoma Company (Livermore) start built. By the late 1880s, a settlement was finally reached, and state officials agreed to provide prisoners for the dam construction.

Much had changed, however, while the delays held up the project. Livermore had died, and his vision of providing waterpower for infant industries in Folsom had to be revised. His two sons (Horatio P. and Charles E.) pressed ahead with the dam construction and the sawmill project. However, instead of building a system providing water for an industrial network driven by water wheels, the Livermores had embraced a new technology in their plans - hydroelectric power, that is, electrical generators powered by water turbines. Emerging from its experimental stages, the electrical power industry was trying to gain a foothold in manufacturing and transportation. A few electrical power plants had been successful on a limited basis in Germany and New York in the late 1880s and early 1890s; however, nothing had been attempted that was on the scale of the Livermore's endeavoring. They sought to construct a canal 9,500 feet long providing water power to four of the largest electrical generators that had been built up the stone dam across the American River, and the bulkhead and headgates for the canal, and the canal itself were finished in 1893. Folsom State Prison was the first to benefit from the dam when it put its own hydroelectric powerhouse into operation, also in 1893. Within two years, the Natoma Company's main powerhouse complex was completed, and was ready to transmit power to Sacramento. It consisted of four 750-kilowatt electrical generators (also called ""dynamos""), each more than eight feet high, weighing more than 57,000 pounds. They were manufactured by the General Electric Company, and to quote a contemporary account: ""these are without doubt the largest three-phase dynamos yet constructed..."" (Journal of Electricity, vol. 1, No. 3, Sept. 1895). Driving these generators were four McCormick dual turbines with a capacity of 1260 horsepower for each pair, which in turn were driven by water surging through four eight-foot- diameter penstocks. The generators have been altered a little over the years, and the governors for the turbines were replaced early in this century. However, the basic equipment is still in place, and was in operation until the hydroelectric plant shut down in 1952.

The Livermore brothers, in partnership with Albert Gallatin (president of the Huntington, Hopkins Hardware Company) formed the Folsom Water Power Company, controlling the dam and the canal, which supplied water to the Sacramento Electric Power and Light Company, also owned by the Livermores and Gallatin. The latter firm operated the power plant at Folsom, the substation in Sacramento, and the streetcar lines in that city. On July 13, 1895, with only two generators in actual operation, electricity was successfully transmitted over uninsulated copper wires the full 22 miles to Sacramento. Newspapers in Sacramento and San Francisco covered this event in detail on their front pages the next day. Sacramento celebrated this technological breakthrough with a ""Grand Electric Carnival"" on September 9, 1895, stringing electric lights along its downtown streets, and decorating the State Capitol with thousands of bulbs. The whole affair caught the attention of the entire state, and even the nation.
While hopes were high for the future of electric power, the Sacramento Electric Power and Light Company had its problems with this new technology. One of the generators ran out of control in 1901, shattering the armature, and the sand, silt, and small gravel that washed into the penstocks from the forebay wore down and damaged the turbine blades on a regular basis.

Despite these setbacks, the Livermores and Gallatin remained confident that electrical power had a solid future. Demand for more electricity continued to grow in the Sacramento Area. Responding to this, they built another, smaller powerhouse in 1897, just below the main powerhouse at the mouth of the tailrace, to take advantage of the 25-foot difference in elevation. This power plant had only one 750-kilowatt generator, powered by a unique continuous rope drive from the turbine.

The success of hydroelectric power development and the expanding popularity of electricity for lighting and for industry and public transportation soon outstripped the capacity of the Folsom Plant. Within a few years after the second powerhouse was built at the Folsom complex, businessmen, investors, and engineers were constructing hydroelectric plants (with more powerful generators) that harnessed water from the Feather River down to the Tuolumne River for rapidly expanding distribution networks providing current to homes and factories in the San Francisco Bay Area.

By the early 1900s, the Folsom Powerhouse was on the brink of becoming an obsolete plant. The unpredictability of the American River water flows continued to plague the Folsom Powerhouse to the point that power transmission to Sacramento began to be interrupted on an intermittent basis. The Livermores were forced to buy electricity from the new Colgate hydroelectric plant on the Yuba River, which was owned by the San Francisco-based California Gas and Electric Company. By 1902-1903, that company had acquired the Folsom Powerhouse, along with several other power plants in the foothills. In 1906, this firm was reorganized to form the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and from that time on, the Folsom Powerhouse remained in the control of P.G.&E.

Although surpassed in capacity and efficiency by newer, larger power plants in the P.G.&E. system, the Folsom Powerhouse still was capable of supplying electricity at a reasonable cost. The company continued to update its operation, and installed new governors in 1906, with new transformers on the second floor. In 1916, Sacramento County built a concrete bridge over the mouth of the forebay for the Leidsdorff Street connection to Greenback Lane, across the river to Orangevale. Construction of the bridge probably lead to installation of the iron pipe railings and electric lights around the forebay for public safety.

P.G.&E. drawings indicate that several substantial changes occurred at the Folsom Powerhouse in 1918, or just thereafter. Four large transformers and three large oil switches were installed just north of the main powerhouse. The one-story, long rectangular building up the hill to the west of the powerhouse was probably constructed not long after the transformers went in. It provided office space for the plant manager, a machine shop/blacksmith shop, and an automobile garage for the powerhouse. The lower powerhouse underwent substantial changes, too. Its original generator was removed and taken to another power plant in the P.G.&E. system. After considering abandoning this facility altogether, the company decided to install a new generator. A new storage building was also built at the south end of the main powerhouse. Finally, there was extensive landscaping put in around the office/shop building in an attempt to beautify the grounds at the powerhouse.
The improvements made to its facilities and the upgrading of its transformers expanded the capacity of the powerhouse sufficiently making it a productive operation for the needs of the twentieth century. While the continued growth in hydroelectric power up to World War II stimulated innovations and improvements in the technology of the electrical power industry, the operation at the Folsom plant continued through the late 1920s and the Great Depression of the 1930s using the same basic machinery of an earlier age. Why the Folsom Powerhouse was retained in the P.G.&E. system is a subject of speculation at this point. Wood bearings and other early technology made the facility increasingly outdated and difficult to operate. The fact that the four original generators and turbines were still running after forty years of operation was evidence of their quality engineering and design. Officials at P.G.&E. no doubt recognized this, and kept the plant running because it could produce needed power that could serve a local market, or be readily integrated into a larger power grid.

The lower powerhouse had problems from its beginnings, and even after a new generator was installed in 1923, replacing the 1897 dynamo, that facility only operated for a short time after being restarted. So despite the investment, this plant was finally shut down in 1924, and was never reactivated.

The historic importance of the main powerhouse, however, was recognized by P.G.&E.'s managers fairly early in this century. A promotional publication of 1911 referred to the power plant as the ""Old powerhouse in Folsom,"" projecting the notion that the company had been a pioneer in the hydroelectric power industry with years of experience behind it. There was also an advantage to be gained from the impressive brick structure that housed the power plant. It presented an image of importance and stability that reflected well on this relatively new company that was expanding in a young industry. As the years passed, P.G.&E. developed the public relations theme of ""progress,"" promoting its contribution to the expansion of electrical power in California at a lower cost to the consumer. Just before the Folsom Powerhouse ceased operation in 1952, the company produced a film recounting its own history and the history of electrical power development in California. The narrator of the film was an ""old timer"" who knew the industry.

The Department of Parks and Recreation acquired the Folsom Powerhouse project area, along with about half of a mile of the canal, as a donation from P.G.&E. in 1958. The property was in good condition when it was brought into the State Park System, and restoration projects for the buildings were not programmed. Minor site development was done to accommodate park visitors. In the late 1960s or early 1970s, interpretive panels and displays depicting the history of the Folsom Powerhouse were installed in the garage at the north end of the office/shop building. Not long after this, the wood-frame trash screen at the mouth of the forebay under the east side of the concrete bridge was reconstructed. Starting around 1980, district and unit staff undertook more vigorous maintenance and restoration activities, repairing facilities damaged by repeated acts of vandalism and years without proper maintenance. Between 1987 and 1990, three major preservation projects were completed on the lower powerhouse, the main powerhouse, and the office/shop building. The state park volunteers on the Board of the Friends of the Folsom Powerhouse Association were instrumental in acquiring funds for the office/shop project, and the Association funded and planned the rehabilitation of the small visitors' center in the garage.

Detailed Description
Pumped storage: Reusing water for peak electricity demand
Demand for electricity is not ""flat"" and constant. Demand goes up and down during the day, and overnight there is less need for electricity in homes, businesses, and other facilities. For example, here in Atlanta, Georgia at 5:00 PM on a hot August weekend day, you can bet there is a huge demand for electricity to run millions of air conditioners! But, 12 hours later at 5:00 AM .... not so much. Hydroelectric plants are more efficient at providing for peak power demands during short periods than are fossil-fuel and nuclear power plants, and one way of doing that is by using ""pumped storage"", which reuses the same water more than once.
Pumped storage is a method of keeping water in reserve for peak period power demands by pumping water that has already flowed through the turbines back up a storage pool above the powerplant at a time when customer demand for energy is low, such as during the middle of the night. The water is then allowed to flow back through the turbine-generators at times when demand is high and a heavy load is placed on the system.
The reservoir acts much like a battery, storing power in the form of water when demands are low and producing maximum power during daily and seasonal peak periods. An advantage of pumped storage is that hydroelectric generating units are able to start up quickly and make rapid adjustments in output. They operate efficiently when used for one hour or several hours. Because pumped storage reservoirs are relatively small, construction costs are generally low compared with conventional hydropower facilities.

458,CHAPTER 1. RENEWABLE ENERGY OVERVIEW,https://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/unit/oea79e/ch05.htm,20012-20012,"CHAPTER 1. RENEWABLE ENERGY OVERVIEW
  a. POLICY BENEFITS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES
b. COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
What are “Renewable Resources”?
The term “renewable” is generally applied to those energy resources and technologies whose common characteristic is that they are non-depletable or naturally replenishable.
Renewable resources include solar energy, wind, falling water, the heat of the earth (geothermal), plant materials (biomass), waves, ocean currents, temperature differences in the oceans and the energy of the tides. Renewable energy technologies produce power, heat or mechanical energy by converting those resources either to electricity or to motive power. The policy maker concerned with development of the national grid system will focus on those resources that have established themselves commercially and are cost effective for on-grid applications. Such commercial technologies include hydroelectric power, solar energy, fuels derived from biomass, wind energy and geothermal energy. Wave, ocean current, ocean thermal and other technologies that are in the research or early commercial stage, as well as non-electric renewable energy technologies, such as solar water heaters and geothermal heat pumps, are also based on renewable resources, but outside the scope of this Manual.
For the purposes of establishing a legal regime governing and encouraging private-sector investment in renewable resources and technologies, the policy strategist will make use of three conceptual approaches. As well as the foregoing technical definition, both political definitions and legal definitions, factor into a policy definition of what resources deserve discrete treatment as “renewable resources”.
Broadly define “Renewable Resources, then clarify that definition by defining each specific renewable resource (e.g., “‘geothermal energy’ means the heat of the earth.”)
From the political perspective, renewable energy resources can be divided into numerous categories depending upon the political goals or objectives under consideration. For example, in a given country, renewable resources may be distinguished by categorizing those which are well established versus those which are underdeveloped; those which have immediate development potential versus those which do not; and those with potential rural versus those with urban customer bases. The political perspective of the policy maker in one country may be to justify different treatment for established resources such as large hydroelectric from nascent resources such as geothermal. In another country, the reverse may be true. Likewise, all of the renewable resources may be treated differently for urban application than for rural application.
Avoid operational definitions. For example, if different types of hydropower are to be treated differently for political or legal reasons, address such treatment in operational language, not by definition.
From the legal perspective, existing laws such as land use, water, mining, and hydrocarbon laws need to be scrutinized to determine their potential jurisdiction over and applicability to renewable resources. It is important to define what technologies are to be considered “renewable” for the purposes of any piece of legislation. Such legislation can define “renewable resources” as appropriate, given the state of development of the natural resources in that country. If a court, legislator or executive interprets a law strictly, the term “renewable resources” as used in a piece of legislation means what that specific piece of legislation says it means, but only for the purposes of that specific legislation. Thus, if a law defines coal as “renewable”, but omits wind, this legal definition will prevail without reference to the technical characteristics of either fuel. In most legal regimes, however, the term “renewable energy” is used to distinguish naturally replenishable fuels from those fuels of which the earth is endowed with fixed stocks. The main examples of stock-limited resources are the fossil fuels (principally coal, petroleum, natural gas, tar sands and oil shales) and the nuclear fuels (principally uranium, thorium, deuterium and lithium).
Can all Renewables be governed by a common policy?
Policy makers should be cognizant of the similarities as well as the variations among renewable energy resources.
From the perspective of the policy strategist, it may be important to determine whether and to what extent energy plans, laws and regulations may be developed using the generic concept “renewable resources”:
· Are the differences among the renewable resources and their applications such that legislation may properly address renewable resources technology by technology?
· Are there sufficient commonalities that renewable resource development may be handled as a generic issue?
The commercial renewable energy technologies
Establish an objective, specific to each renewable resource, which is designed to achieve national goals.
Fundamentally, the answer depends on why the question is being asked, and in which country the policy is being applied. There are, however, guidelines which may prove useful to policy strategists making this determination in any country. Essentially, form must follow function. In other words, it is essential that the policy strategist understand the nature of each of the renewable resources and the nature of the process by which each of those resources is developed.
The resources are fundamentally different. Although any resource that relies on the heat or motion of the earth, the moon or the sun (or the sun’s radiation) to produce power for human consumption is a renewable resource, the ways one harnesses the resources are sufficiently different that laws and regulations governing these resources usually deal with each resource on an individual basis - treating each resource as unique. At present, the major commercial grid-connected renewable resources are hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, wind energy and solar. In the majority of legal regimes, hydroelectric and geothermal resources are identified as owned in common by the people of the country and husbanded by the government for their benefit.
· Geothermal resources require extraction (and reinjection). Drilling for geothermal resources involves many of the same discrete considerations involved with drilling for petroleum (hydrocarbons) and individual treatment is prudent.
Geothermal resources
· Hydroelectric resources are inextricably linked with surface water rights, including potable water, navigation, irrigation, navigation and recreational rights. The historical complexities of sorting out these juxtaposed rights usually dictate individual treatment of hydroelectric resource issues.
Hydroelectric resources
· Wind energy and solar draw on resources - wind and sun energy - generally thought of as being free for the taking. The principal resource issue with both of these renewables is surface land. Therefore there is no general technical requirement for individual treatment.
Wind energy and solar
· Biomass is a broadly inclusive term, often encompassing wood and wood waste, agricultural waste and residue, energy crops, and - sometimes - landfill gas resources. Resource availability and cost can be highly variable, and resources may require management of a type not frequently required for other renewables. Individual treatment is one method of addressing this complication.
Biomass
What are the renewable energy applications?
Renewable energy applications generally break down into two categories or applications, “on-grid” and “off-grid”.
· A “grid” may be defined as an integrated generation, transmission, and distribution system serving numerous customers. Characteristically, a grid is a portfolio of generating units operating under the control of a central dispatch center. Grids may be national, regional or local (in the latter case they are typically referred to as “mini-grids”).
· “On-grid” and “off-grid” are terms which describe how electricity is delivered. Technically, every one of the commercial renewable resources can be and have been installed both on-grid and off-grid. Furthermore, although larger megawatt installations tend to be on-grid, large renewable plants may profitably be built “inside the fence” - a term describing a self-generator, a plant built to supply a single customer such as a mine, a manufacturing plant or an agribusiness. Hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal facilities tend to be economical at capacity levels well in excess of one megawatt (1 MW) and, therefore, are typically - but not necessarily - developed and financed as “base load” electricity resources (i.e., the normally operated generating facilities within a utility system) and connected to a grid. Solar arrays and “wind farms” also can be grid-connected.
· “Off-grid” applications, in general, serve only one load, such as a home or small business. Off-grid applications can take many forms, from photovoltaics for an individual village home to centralized windmills to power a village water pump or a commercial battery charging facility. These off-grid applications are most generally used in remote or rural settings.
· “Mini-grids” have begun to be developed by system engineers over the past few years, for isolated communities. These systems may integrate wind, solar energy and, in some cases, diesel generators and/or storage systems to provide power from a mix of resources to more than one customer, typically a village or cooperative.
For more discussion of off-grid and mini-grid issues, see below, Chapter 5a (Universal Electrification Policy: Renewable Technologies & Universal Electrification Efforts). The following charts illustrate common on-grid. and off-grid applications for which renewable energy is best suited.

On-Grid Uses
· In addition to generating bulk electricity, the renewable energy technologies can serve a number of other valuable on-grid roles.
- For grid support, a power station is constructed somewhere along a transmission line to remedy high resistance in the line. This reduces transmission losses and prevents expensive substation equipment from being degraded by excessive heat (this application is a type of “distributed generation”).
- In distributed generation, as opposed to central station generation, power plants are smaller and they exist at more locations on the grid. This reduces transmission costs. Distributed generation tends to yield the largest returns in locations where it averts the need to increase transmission capacity.
- Biomass and geothermal are well-suited to regeneration.

Off-Grid Uses
· This chart is not comprehensive, but lists some of the common off-grid applications for which renewable energy is best suited.
- Power and heat for remote villages, islands, tourist facilities, industrial and military installations, houses, clinics, schools, and stores.
- Water pumping, disinfection, and desalination.
- Communication stations, navigational aids, and road signals.
· For most types of energy applications, on-and off-grid, one or more of the renewable energy technologies is cost-competitive.
· Worldwide, millions upon millions of dollars are wasted by utilities, governments, businesses, and individuals that ignore opportunities to improve cost-effectiveness through the use of renewable energy.
· Energy decision-makers can improve their energy costs and performance by giving full and informed consideration to the renewable energy sources every time they choose an energy technology.
a. POLICY BENEFITS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES
Cost-benefit analysis is a generally accepted method of evaluating the value of competing energy sources.
Although a complete list of the benefits of renewable technologies can be very extensive, they can be categorized under four headings: environment, diversification, sustainability and economics.
Renewable resources are environmentally benign.
Renewable energy facilities generally have a very modest impact on their surrounding environment. The discharges of unwanted or unhealthy substances into the air, ground or water commonly associated with other forms of generation can be reduced significantly by deploying renewables. Clean technologies can also produce significant indirect economic benefits. For example, unlike fossil-fuel facilities, renewable facilities will not need to be fitted with scrubbing technology to mitigate air pollution, nor will a country need to expend resources in cleaning up polluted rivers or the earth around sites contaminated with fossil-fuel by-products. Furthermore, they provide greenhouse gas reduction benefits and should a worldwide market for air emission credits emerge as has been predicted, countries with a strong portfolio of renewable energy projects may be able to earn pollution credits which can be exchanged for hard currency. Finally, having a clean environmental profile enhances the attractiveness of renewable projects in the eyes of investors, especially the multilateral development agencies, many of whom operate under guidelines that require the promotion of non-polluting technologies.
Renewable resources promote energy diversification.
Development of a diverse portfolio of generation assets reduces both a country’s dependence on any one particular form of technology or fuel and its vulnerability to supply disruption and price increases.
The primary long-term benefit of renewable technologies is that once a renewable project has been constructed, and fully depredated, it becomes a permanent, environmentally dean, and low cost component of a country’s energy system. In effect, the construction of a renewable energy project provides future generations a low cost, energy facility that produces power with little or no environmental degradation.
Renewable resources are sustainable.
Renewable technologies are designed to run on a virtually inexhaustible or replenishable supply of natural “fuels.” Expanding a nation’s electricity supply by attracting investment to renewable energy projects is, by defintion, a strategy for sustainable growth, since operation of the facilities does not deplete the earth’s finite resources.
Renewable energy facilities enhance the value of the overall resource base of a country by using the country’s indigenous resources for electricity generation. Moreover, since these facilities operate on “fuels” that are both indigenous and renewable (as distinguished from imported fossil fuels), they may reduce balance-of-payment problems. Reduced dependence on fuel imports reduces exposure to currency fluctuations and fuel price volatility. The construction and operation of renewable projects normally generate significant local economic activity, often in previously “resource poor” areas of a country. Renewable energy projects thus act as engines for regional economic development. In the case of large scale, on-grid projects, easements will need to be purchased and local workers hired to construct and operate the facility. Frequently, a local industry such as a sugar mill or a paper mill (when biomass technology is employed) will be associated with the development, enhancing the opportunities for joint ventures between local landowners and private investors who may supply technological expertise. Smaller scale facilities often attract local private sector involvement. Local involvement, in turn, stimulates new economic activity in a multiplier effect and adds value to the local tax base.
Appendix A provides concise descriptions of renewable energy technologies, their applications and environmental impacts. Readers interested in gaining additional knowledge with respect to any of these technologies should also consult US/ECRE’s sponsoring trade associations, also set forth in Appendix B of the Manual.
  b. COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
The ultimate question for the policy strategist is whether power generated from a renewable energy source is affordable given the service it is providing.
Universally, the goal of electric power generation planners is to deliver electricity to the maximum number of customers at the lowest possible price. The political acceptability of power generated from any source will depend upon the ultimate tariff to the consumer relative to the benefits delivered.
Does renewable energy generate affordable power?
On a total cost basis, a new, renewable energy, generating facility is often cost competitive with a conventional fuel facility provided that the cost calculation considers long-term fuel costs - and even more so when one considers environmental costs and benefits. Since this generalization is not true in every situation confronting the policy planner, the policy planner will need to apply cost-effectiveness criteria adapted to each situation.
What are the applicable cost-effectiveness evaluation criteria?
Any given electric generating technology (including renewables) may be cost effective in one market or application and not in another. There is no simple calculus a policy maker can apply, but a number of established criteria will assist in determining the financial viability of renewable energy generation.
The quality and quantity of the resource. Quality and quantity of renewable resources may be determined by a government-conducted resource assessment, but private-sector developers commonly have their own pre-feasibility and feasibility studies which can be more accurate measures of the commercial viability of a given project. The measures of resource quality and quantity are unique to each resource, but for each of the renewables, resource quality and quantity affects the energy input to, and the effective capacity of a generation facility. In geothermal resource development, for example, the temperature of the resource and the dissolved impurities determine the requisite production equipment. The cost of production equipment, in turn, affects the installed cost and the per-kilowatt-hour cost of delivered power. In biomass, the quality and BTU content of the fuel will influence installed costs, and operations and maintenance costs.
The location of the resource. Proximity of a resource to a customer base directly impacts costs, as does proximity to an existing infrastructure (roads, transmission lines, etc.), to industry support facilities (concrete plants, etc.), and to the developer’s technology manufacturing base. In the case of geothermal, the depth of the resource is a major cost factor. For the hydro, wind and solar technologies, climatic variations (rainfall, cloud cover, intense storms) affect cost. For biomass, transportation distances between the fuel source and the generating facility may significantly affect the electricity cost.
Government-imposed costs. For the private-sector developer, time is money. The time expended in responding to bid proposals, in obtaining requisite permits, licenses and concessions, and in negotiating contracts increases the costs of renewable projects. The policy maker should consider policies that organize and simplify the local institutional processes. Such policies may prevent adding major costs and time delays to what would otherwise be a highly cost-effective facility. Similarly, government-imposed taxes, fees, tariffs and royalty payments are all passed to the electricity consumer and effect the kilowatt-hour cost of delivered power.
The development process is sufficiently similar that for many purposes the renewable resources may be treated similarly. The development process employed by hydroelectric, geothermal, wind energy, biomass and solar renewable technologies may be described and analyzed in three discrete stages: “reconnaissance”, “exploration” and “exploitation”. Each technology may use different terms for these three stages, but the concepts are similar.
· Reconnaissance is an activity which determines by visual observation and scientific studies whether an area may be a source of commercially exploitable resources. It does not affect the present surface use of the land.
· Exploration is an activity which demonstrates the dimensions, position, characteristics and extent of resources by scientific studies. It may affect the present surface use of the land. An extensive outlay of capital may be required for exploring the potential of some renewable resources such as geothermal and, to a lesser degree, wind and hydro resources. Where resource exploration is expensive, this may necessitate that exclusive rights to the relevant renewable resources in the area be awarded to the explorer. These rights may be granted for a limited term, but if exploration proves the commercial viability of the resource, a private-sector developer will require that the temporary exploration rights be converted to long-term exploitation rights.
· Exploitation is an activity which enables electricity to be produced from renewable resources, either through the intermediate production of steam or the direct production of electricity from a chemical or mechanical process. Exclusive, long-term rights are prerequisite to the sustainability of this production.
The expense associated with each phase of resource development has a direct impact on the cost-effectiveness of the electricity produced. The first generation facilities developed in any resource area are almost always going to cost more per kilowatt hour produced than will later facilities, since most of the reconnaissance and exploration costs will be included in the cost of the first facility. If, however, there is some assurance of a market for power from additional facilities, should the initial facility prove feasible, the reconnaissance and exploration costs may be allocated over more kilowatt hours thus reducing the initial cost. By allocating initial reconaissance and exploration costs over multiple projects, the per kilowatt hour cost may be significantly reduced.
Financing costs. For renewables, the bulk of a project’s total lifetime cost is represented by the initial capital cost, and will be incurred before the project ever comes on line. The cost of a renewable energy is in the technology effort exerted at the outset of a project and all of the renewables share “front-end-loaded” cost profiles. Consequently, the majority of new generation facilities are funded through project financing, whereby the principal and interest (and profit) are paid from the proceeds of the project.
Cost of Electricity
Power purchase agreement. The “power purchase agreement” - the power and capacity contract between the owner of a generating facility and its customers - rather than the credit-worthiness of the developer, collateralizes the loan. Since renewable energy projects are front-end-loaded, the costs of capital significantly affects installed cost. High risk factors associated with initial projects developed in new resource areas also translate into higher costs of capital. The challenge for the country policy maker - especially in a country which seeks to attract initial projects to a new resource area - is to implement new mechanisms to lower financing costs. Development of such mechanisms may prove more productive if done in consultation with the private-sector developer. For example, in some situations, municipal customers may have access to tax-exempt or low interest bonds that can be used to finance energy projects at a lower cost than if they were financed with conventional borrowing.
In a rapidly advancing technological era, the most prudent course for a decision maker is to avoid reliance on old information as to whether a given renewable technology can fulfill a given energy need.
System costs. The cost or cost-savings of integrating a given renewable energy generator into a system is difficult to quantify. By diversifying the energy supply mix, a system can protect or buffer the ratepayer from the potential financial risks and volatility of changing fuel prices, changing environmental requirements, and common design flaws that can result in large operational and maintenance costs. Reliance on imported fuels may be eliminated and balances of payment problems thereby reduced. With the exception of biomass, there are no intrinsic fuel costs for an established renewable energy generating facility. Consequently, an established renewable facility serves as a hedge against inflation in an inflationary market.
For an example of a renewable facility as an inflationary hedge one may examine the history of the older hydroelectric power dams. The following chart illustrates the renewable technologies which are currently available in the marketplace.

Important Characteristics of the Renewable Technologies
· All six renewable energy sectors offer technologies which are proven and are available in the marketplace. All can be purchased today in forms that are reliable and cost-competitive.
· “Capacity Factor” summarizes the output patterns.
- Geothermal and most biomass plants provide baseload energy.
- Most hydro and some biomass plants are highly dispatchable, offering a range of options from baseload to peaking.
- Run-of-river hydro is intermittent, but variations in its output tend to be slow and predictable.
- Solar ranges from intermittent to intermediate, depending on how well it matches the pattern of energy usage.
- Wind is intermittent, but studies have found that most grids can add an intermittent source up to 15% of their capacity without requiring any compensatory action. Higher shares from intermittent sources are usually easy to accommodate.

Electric Power Pole
A History of Ashland's Electric Utility
In 1886 a group of enterprising businessmen decided Ashland needed electricity. They formed the Ashland Electric Power and Light Company by selling 15 shares of stock at $1,000 each. They then obtained water rights from Ashland Creek and proceeded to build a small electrical generator right near the entrance to Lithia Park.

Three years later, the first electric light was turned on in Ashland's Plaza and the investor-owned utility began stringing distribution lines around the city, charging customers $1 dollar per month for each light bulb in use. They also created special electric rates for some customers. For example, local churches received a half rate and so did bedroom lights, presumably because they were used less than other lights. Saloons, of which Ashland had several, were charged the highest electric rate.
Soon, more electrical power was needed and Ashland Power and Light began purchasing electricity from the Condor Company, which built a power line from Gold Ray Dam on the Rogue River to Ashland by way of Central Point and Jacksonville.
At the turn of the century, local governments and its citizens took activist stands on local issues. The city found itself embroiled in controversy with the power company over rates and service. In 1904, the Ashland City Council brought suit against the power company over water rights along Ashland Creek. They canceled Ashland Power and Light's franchise with the city and condemned the utility. The issue went to court and would take years to resolve.
Subsequent rulings favored the city's position and in 1906, the City of Ashland took charge of the electric company along with its ditches, power plant, water rights and land. Ashland Power and Light, however, kept its distribution system and continued to supply the city with power through the Condor Company's lines.
In 1908, the city installed its own 300-kilowatt hydroelectric plant in the hills above Ashland. The Reeder Gulch plant provided all of Ashland's electrical needs at the time. The city council then voted to repeal the perpetual franchise granted to Ashland Power and Light back in 1889, and ordered it to remove its poles and wires from city streets. The power company sued and a Federal Court judge ruled against the city, claiming the franchise could not be revoked. The situation by then had become quite hostile.
By 1915, the California Oregon Power Company, better known as COPCO, purchased the Condor Company and Ashland Power and Light. COPCO officials decided to lease its distribution lines to the City of Ashland in return for a contract to sell electricity inside the city. A few years later, the city bought the distribution lines from COPCO. For nearly a century now, all sales and distribution of electrical power in Ashland has been sold through this public utility operated by the City of Ashland on behalf of its citizens.
By 1916 with a growing population and business district, the city's hydro plant could not keep up with demand. In that year and each year there after, the utility began purchasing increasing amounts of additional power from COPCO and later from Pacific Power and Light at wholesale prices. The city, in turn, sold power to its citizens over its own distribution lines at retail prices. Contracts for the purchase of power continued uninterrupted for the next 64 years.
In 1962 the antique hydroelectric plant on Ashland Creek was shut down but reopened in 1985 with a new generator.  It produces less than two percent of the city's electrical needs.
Electrical power is distributed to consumers in the United States by two types of utilities:
       1) Investor-owned utilities ex: Pacific Power &  Light Company
       2) publicly owned utilities ex:  the City of Ashland
 About 25 percent of the nation's electric consumers are served by publicly owned utilities.
There are benefits to municipal ownership. Ashland's utility is run by a city council elected from the utility's own customers. They can be more responsive to local needs.
Local ownership also protects against monopolization of a vital public service by a few large private companies. 

Public power was introduced into the Pacific Northwest by the city of McMinnville in 1889, the same year Ashland Power and Light began service. In the 1930's that public power became available on a mass scale. The concept was to provide all Americans with what was called ""postage-stamp"" electricity rates, where all Americans paid the same rate.
Congress created the Bonneville Power Administration in 1937.

Bonneville Dam, located east of Portland, was the first major New Deal project in the Northwest built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  It was the first Flood-control hydroelectric dam built across the Columbia River.  Its massive turbines have supplied millions of kilowatt-hours of low cost electricity every year since 1938.
Bonneville would market for the federal government, the new power, rather than leave it to private industry to distribute.
 
By 1943, 96 percent of Columbia River electricity was used for war manufacturing. The war led to the creation of the Northwest Power Pool, a cooperative effort by public and private utilities to increase interconnections and exchanges of electric power.

With one half of all BPA electricity reserved for public power uses, Oregon and Washington lawmakers approved legislation allowing residents in rural areas and cities to form public utility districts or PUDs and electric cooperatives. All would buy cheap hydropower from BPA and distribute it to customers throughout the Northwest insuring local ownership, control and lower electric rates for consumers. BPA, the marketer for this federal electricity is headquartered in Portland.

In February 1982, the City of Ashland changed its wholesale electric power supplier. They ended a decades-old relationship with Pacific Power and Light Company and began purchasing power directly from the Bonneville Power Administration. BPA offered the City of Ashland, not only a stable long-term supply of low-cost power, but an array of conservation programs and technical assistance and thereby became the 124th city to purchase power from BPA.
Ashland's contract to purchase wholesale electricity from BPA is in effect until the year 2028.

Power purchased from BPA is delivered to Ashland over PP&L transmission lines, where it is distributed from three substations for consumers. Ashland's municipal utility serves about eleven (11,000) thousand customers with residential consumers making up about 85 percent of the total.  Electrical rates within the City of Ashland are low with purchases of power approximately 95% carbon free.

The City of Ashland’s Electric Department over the years has been very concerned their responsibility to the environment. The Department removed transformers or switches that had PCB oil in them and replaced them with transformers with safe environmentally friendly oil.

There are areas in town where small animals find their way up a power pole.  In these areas, for example, the department has put guards on our transformers to keep squirrels from electrocuting themselves.
Our tree trimming program is designed to “train” the trees to grow around our lines, as much as possible.  The department is fortunate to have an Arborists on staff and utilizes expertise when trimming.

The City of Ashland's Electric Department has received national recognition for Excellence in Reliability from American Public Power Association (APPA) since 2014.

The flow of water produces hydroelectricity.

Detailed Description
Falling water produces hydroelectric power.
The theory is to build a dam on a large river that has a large drop in elevation (there are not many hydroelectric plants in Kansas or Florida). The dam stores lots of water behind it in the reservoir. Near the bottom of the dam wall there is the water intake. Gravity causes it to fall through the penstock inside the dam. At the end of the penstock there is a turbine propeller, which is turned by the moving water. The shaft from the turbine goes up into the generator, which produces the power. Power lines are connected to the generator that carry electricity to your home and mine. The water continues past the propeller through the tailrace into the river past the dam.

John Hart
An important facility on the Campbell River
Our John Hart Generating Station is on the Campbell River, just a few minutes from the town of Campbell River. The river is a great place for such activities as camping, picnicking, swimming, hiking, fishing, kayaking, tubing, sight-seeing and nature appreciation.
The facilities along the Campbell River system not only generate electricity, but also contribute to the surrounding communities by providing such services as flood control, domestic water supply and recreation.
On March 7, 2000 the Province of B.C. officially recognized the Campbell River as a BC Heritage River. In recognizing this river, the government has acknowledged its cultural and economic heritage while endorsing the concept of a working river where economic activities are compatible with natural heritage and recreational values.
John Hart is located on the traditional territories of We Wai Kai (Cape Mudge) First Nation, Wei Wai Kum (Campbell River) First Nation and K’omoks First Nations and Homalco First Nation.
