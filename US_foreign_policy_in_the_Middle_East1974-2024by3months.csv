JANUARY 11, 2024, 4:29 PM
Following Hamas’s brutal massacre of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, Israel’s massive military campaign against the group has brought the Gaza Strip to the brink of annihilation and the Middle East to the edge of a broader war. A slew of incidents since then suggests that the conflict could escalate even further: the United States’ sinking of three Houthi vessels in response to the group’s attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea; a string of assassinations of high-level members of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted by Israel and the United States in Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria; a recent warning by Israeli war cabinet Minister Benny Gantz that “the time for a diplomatic solution is running out” regarding Hezbollah’s attacks on Israel and vice versa; and reports that the Biden administration is drawing up plans for the United States to respond militarily on multiple fronts in the region.
Israel-Hamas War
News, analysis, and background on the ongoing conflict.
MORE ON THIS TOPIC
Amid this turmoil, Washington continues to reach for its old playbook: throwing money, weapons, and military assets at the region. The Biden administration remains adamant that pursuing an Israel-Saudi normalization deal centered on U.S. security guarantees to both countries is the key to achieving lasting peace and prosperity in the Middle East. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken even visited Saudi Arabia, where he spoke of Riyadh’s continued interest in striking such a deal.
This approach is bound to backfire.
Washington should face reality: U.S. Middle East policy has failed. At the heart of this failure are the United States’ main regional partnerships. The two crucial U.S. partners in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are liabilities to the United States, not assets. Although the two states maintain considerable political, economic, and social differences, they both consistently undermine U.S. interests and the values that the United States claims to stand for. Washington should fundamentally reorient its approach to both countries, moving from unconditional support to arm’s-length relationships.
Israel’s war in Gaza epitomizes the violence done to stated U.S. values while also jeopardizing U.S. interests in the Middle East. The destruction wreaked by this war will take generations to fix, and Washington’s global image has been permanently tarnished by its support for such actions.
In the days immediately following the Oct. 7 terror attacks, Israel pledged to destroy Hamas while admitting that although forces were “balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage.” The focus does not appear to have changed much since then as the Israeli military has undertaken what some critics of the campaign consider to be collective punishment, killing Palestinian civilians with U.S.-made weapons. According to the Hamas-controlled Gaza health authorities, an estimated 70 percent of Palestinians killed by Israel have been women and children. Approximately 1.9 million people—more than 90 percent of Gaza’s population—have been displaced due to the war, and more than 45 percent of Gaza’s total housing stock was destroyed or damaged by mid-November, according to United Nations calculations based on figures reported by the Hamas-controlled Gazan government.
Although Israel claims otherwise, its strategy appears to be having much less of an impact on Hamas and its capabilities. At the same time, the war may end up planting the seeds for future armed resistance through its indiscriminate killing of civilians.
The prospects of escalation into a broader regional conflict with direct U.S. involvement increase  by the day. Skirmishes between Israel and Lebanon-based militant Islamist group Hezbollah are escalating dramatically, and there have been at least 115 attacks on U.S. military personnel throughout the Middle East by Iranian proxies since Oct. 17. Israel has urged the United States to directly confront Iran over these attacks, despite it being against U.S. interests to get drawn into a broader war.
Washington appears either unable or unwilling to leverage its so-called special relationship with Israel or sway Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who often boasts of his ability to manipulate the United States. Instead, Washington has continued its blank-check approach to Israel, most recently providing more than $14 billion in military aid in a package approved in November and risking massive escalation in the process.
The other key U.S. partner in the region, Saudi Arabia, is one of the most autocratic states in the world. Riyadh commits widespread human rights abuses at home and actively supports other autocracies engaged in similar activities throughout the region.
Despite Riyadh and its allies going to great lengths to present Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a reformer leading the kingdom into the future, the young ruler has embarked on a campaign of power consolidation and centralization. Regime control over state and society has never been greater.

5 Reasons the Israel-Palestine Conflict Won’t End Anytime Soon
Extremists, lobbyists, meddling outsiders, and deeper structural problems mean that the issue is likely to remain unresolved.
Saudi Arabia is a principal source of political, economic, and societal disorder across the Middle East. Riyadh is connected to nearly every conflict zone and geopolitical fault line spanning the region. The U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia epitomizes the “myth of authoritarian stability”—the notion that autocratic rulers keep the peace in the region. But the opposite is true: Rather than being the solution to the region’s issues, these actors both create and exacerbate the greatest underlying problems in the Middle East.
The most egregious example of Riyadh’s destabilizing behavior is the military intervention it spearheaded alongside the United Arab Emirates in Yemen. Since 2015, this military campaign has produced the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and caused more than 377,000 deaths, according to U.N. estimates. The war is at a fragile standstill primarily due to Riyadh’s inability to defeat the Houthis, and after nearly nine years of ruinous fighting, the Houthis are arguably stronger than ever before. In response to the Israel-Hamas war, the group is carrying out regular attacks on commercial shipping passing through the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb Strait, adding a dangerous new flash point to the ongoing conflict.
Ultimately, unwavering U.S. support has emboldened Israel and Saudi Arabia to pursue reckless policies, knowing that the United States will come to their aid and will not hold them responsible. Common sense suggests that Washington should radically alter course. Unfortunately, that’s not what the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden seems to have in mind.
The Biden administration has centered its regional policies around efforts to broker normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel as an extension of the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, which witnessed Israel formally normalize relations with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in 2020 and were later expanded to include Morocco and Sudan.
In return for normalizing relations with Israel, the Saudi crown prince has repeatedly made his demands clear: The United States must provide the kingdom with a formal security guarantee and assist in the development of Riyadh’s civilian nuclear program.
Since Oct. 7, Israeli, Saudi, and U.S. officials have repeatedly reiterated their commitment to striking this deal. Saudi-Israel normalization has been packaged together in what U.S. commentator Thomas L. Friedman referred to as a “single formula” to somehow preserve a two-state solution, balance against Iran, and counter China’s ambitions in the Middle East.
Biden has repeatedly claimed that Hamas launched its attack on Oct. 7 with the intention of derailing Saudi-Israel normalization. Numerous U.S. administration officials have since stressed their continued efforts toward brokering such an agreement.
Israeli officials have also expressed their desire to return to such a deal, with Netanyahu claiming in November that the prospects of normalization “will be even riper” after the war.
For its part, Saudi Arabia has been engaged in a balancing act, using rhetoric that is critical of Israel’s campaign in Gaza while also reiterating Riyadh’s continued interest in normalization. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with Mohammed bin Salman and continue the push for this deal.
A few months before Oct. 7, Axios reported that there were rumors that Israel was pushing for its own U.S. security guarantee as part of this Saudi normalization agreement, and that policymakers were hoping that this addition would make the deal more palatable in Washington. This outcome now seems even more likely.
In the context of normalization discussions prior to the Hamas attack, Netanyahu referred to the Palestinian issue as merely a “checkbox” while also presenting a map of what he referred to as the “new Middle East” to the United Nations in September, in which the Palestinian territories were shown as part of Israel.
In fact, Netanyahu recently reiterated to Likud party parliamentarians that he remains “the only one who will prevent a Palestinian state in Gaza and [the West Bank] after the war,” and according to Israeli media, he is reportedly pressuring Washington in private to stop publicly endorsing a two-state solution. Netanyahu recently took credit for the collapse of the Oslo Accords, saying he was “proud” of preventing a two-state solution—a stated U.S. policy objective for decades—and vowing to continue ensuring no such solution could emerge.
But the war in Gaza should demonstrate that trying to sidestep the future of the Palestinian people is a foolish strategy. Nor can you separate it from the broader illiberal and unstable regional order. It remains intimately tied to the broader aspirations of the Arab masses for genuine political, economic, and social freedom—and it is something that cannot be forcibly sidelined through frameworks such as the Abraham Accords.
U.S. support for the accords and Saudi-Israel normalization framework is based on the flawed underlying assumption that the United States and its partners are capable of forcibly upholding an illiberal regional order in the Middle East without incurring considerable political, human, and economic costs in the process. Providing Israel or Saudi Arabia with a U.S. security guarantee would amount to a catastrophic miscalculation with long-term ramifications for the United States.
Washington should seize this moment to fundamentally transform its approach to its Middle East partnerships. By moving from reflexive support toward arm’s-length relationships, the United States can end its complicity in its partners’ policies while fundamentally reorienting its Middle East policy.
Of course, such a fundamental reorientation will be difficult: That policy has, for decades, been rooted in an array of misconceptions and structural barriers to change. An entrenched system of lobbying and special interests designed to preserve status quo policies represents the most immediate obstacle. Among the U.S. political elite, the perceived political costs of transforming the U.S. relationship with Israel and Saudi Arabia have long been an impediment to reform.
Coupled with this is a consensus view inside Washington’s Beltway that is often incapable of seriously considering greater detachment from the Middle East. The search for funding, professional ambition, and socialization all work to ensure that people working on the region tend to favor the broad strokes of U.S Middle East policy.
Pushing for change will be an uphill battle, but the need has never been clearer. After decades of projecting force into the region without a coherent strategy, the United States has spent trillions of dollars but failed to produce regional stability or advance U.S. interests. These interests in the region are limited, and their advancement does not require unconditional political or military support for any actor.
Washington’s unwavering devotion to its current approach to the region has produced a vicious cycle: By committing itself to the root of regional instability, the United States repeatedly finds itself having to confront challenges that are largely the product of its own presence and policies in the Middle East.
The human and material costs of Washington’s Middle East policy have been immense. What will billions more in military aid and an expansive U.S. presence in the Middle East accomplish in the years to come? History suggests that it will produce continued damage to U.S. interests and regional stability.
It is past time to change course in the Middle East. Failure to do so risks formalizing Washington’s commitment to a cycle of instability that will continue to impact the region—and undermine U.S. interests—for generations.

Oil Dependence and U.S. Foreign Policy
The United States’ dependence on oil has long influenced its foreign policy. U.S. oil development spans three major periods: the rise of oil as a commodity, beginning in 1850; the post–World War II age of geopolitical competition; and the post–Cold War era of deregulation and diversification. Today, U.S. oil production is booming, drawing renewed scrutiny to the country’s climate-driven efforts to globally phase out fossil fuels.

The development of the Watt steam engine in the late eighteenth century spurs a wave of mechanization in Europe and the United States known as the Industrial Revolution. Coal is the main energy source driving the revolution in its beginning years. In the mid-1800s, kerosene produced from refined crude oil begins to make its way onto the market in the United States as a lighting fuel, an alternative to the dwindling supply of whale oil. Crude oil is successfully extracted using a new drilling method in Pennsylvania, which sparks a regional influx of speculative oil drilling. The first U.S. oil refinery comes online in 1861, and the United States exports its first shipment of refined oil to London. Over the next century and a half, oil supplants coal as the country’s preeminent fuel source and contributes to its emergence as a major economic power.
1850–1865
Competition for Oil

In 1880, the United States is responsible for 85 percent of the world’s crude oil production and refining, and kerosene is the fourth largest U.S. export. However, U.S. dominance of European and Asian oil markets is challenged by new oil finds controlled by Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Russia. Still, over the next two decades, major oil finds in states such as California, Oklahoma, and Texas help increase U.S. production from about twenty-six million barrels of oil annually to around sixty-four million barrels per year. By 1900, more than two hundred oil byproducts—including fuel for stoves and internal combustion engines, as well as lubricants for industrial machinery—begin to enter daily life. The 1901 Spindletop gusher—the largest to date—fuels a major oil rush in Texas, and U.S. oil production nearly triples in a decade.
1880–1900
The Model T

Henry Ford’s invention of the Model T in 1908—the world’s first inexpensive, mass-produced car—helps pave the way for a significant increase in auto ownership. By 1910, U.S. consumption of petrol (gasoline) surpasses kerosene. By 1927, the United States is the most motorized country in the world, with one motor vehicle for roughly every five people. Comparatively, other major industrial countries like Britain, France, and Germany have about one motor vehicle for every forty-four people. The United States continues to lead auto ownership per capita for the next century, and refined-motor fuel becomes the country’s predominant use of oil.

Birth of U.S. Oil Majors

By the 1880s, John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil owns 90 percent of the U.S. oil refineries and pipelines and the world’s largest oil tanker fleet. In 1906, the U.S. government takes the company to court for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of the government in May 1911. In July, Standard Oil is broken into separate entities, including those that later become Chevron, Amoco, Mobil, Conoco, and Exxon. These companies come to dominate much of the international oil market for the next six decades.
1911
World War I

With the onset of World War I, oil becomes vital for modern warfare, fueling ships, land vehicles, and planes. German attacks disrupt U.S. oil exports to Britain and France, causing oil shortages in those countries. When the United States enters the war allied against Germany in 1917, the Wilson administration steps up efforts to supply oil to Britain and France. U.S. production cannot meet both domestic and war demand, so the United States begins importing oil from Mexico to close the gap. During the U.S. war effort, Mexican imports average between 2.5 million barrels and 4 million barrels of oil per month, supplementing U.S. production of about 30 million barrels a month.
1914–1918
Addressing Oil Insecurity
In 1919, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates U.S. oil supplies will run out in ten years, triggering the country’s first oil security fears. Though the United States produces roughly one million barrels of oil per day, or 65 percent of global oil supplies, more than 90 percent is consumed domestically. By 1920, crude prices increase to $3 a barrel, more than double the price in 1914. Congress passes the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 [PDF], which requires leasing of federal lands for energy prospecting for the first time. In response to British and French attempts to shut U.S. oil companies out of their Middle East protectorates, the law includes a provision denying access to U.S. mineral rights by any foreign entities whose governments deny similar access to U.S. companies. U.S. oil companies also begin pursuing concessions in Latin America.
1920
The Red Line Agreement

Following British and French attempts to shut U.S. oil companies out of regions they control in the Middle East, the U.S. government begins active oil diplomacy, insisting on an “open door” policy that would allow all companies to compete for foreign concessions regardless of national origins. But the doctrine fails to take hold. Instead, a consortium of seven oil companies is given financial interest in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the companies agree to not independently develop oil in an area that spans from Turkey to Iraq and Saudi Arabia, but excludes Egypt, Iran, and Kuwait. This 1928 Red Line Agreement with its “self-denial clause” allows seven companies, five of which are American, to control the bulk of Mideast oil production by the early 1930s.
1928
Oil Quotas

Technological breakthroughs and increasing oil production in Latin America, the Middle East, and the United States lead to overproduction. Disproving shortage projections by the U.S. Geological Survey, in less than a decade U.S. oil production more than doubles from what it was in 1920. Britain’s attempt to stabilize European oil prices through the 1928 Achnacarry Agreement, which limits sales by oil producers, is met with mixed success. In 1931, oil prices plummet to just a few cents a barrel. In 1933, the U.S. government imposes a production quota system for states and a duty tax on imported oil to keep cheap oil from flooding the market. Though the Supreme Court overturns the federal quota system in 1935, U.S. oil-producing states voluntarily continue it and prices begin to recover.
1928–1933
Nationalization

Governments begin to take a more active role in the oil industry. Iranian leader Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1932 cancels the concession of the British oil company Anglo-Persia but then later retreats after striking a deal for a fixed royalty and an increase in Persian laborers employed by the company. Meanwhile, European governments impose import quotas, set prices, and require fuel blending with ethanol made from excess crops, as well as requiring investment in domestic oil infrastructure. In 1938, the Mexican government nationalizes the oil industry and revokes U.S. oil concessions. The U.S. government does not retaliate, in part due to fears Mexico will align with Germany in World War II. Mexico’s actions foreshadow a wave of oil nationalizations that will follow in the decades after the war.
1932–1939
Oil Embargo on Japan

At the start of World War II, the United States is responsible for 60 percent of world production, followed by Russia and Venezuela. Japan, heavily reliant on U.S. oil imports, begins stockpiling oil and equipment shortly before it invades Indochina. In response, the U.S. government imposes controls on oil exports to Japan, effectively cutting off oil supplies in the summer of 1941. On December 7, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor but fails to target the Navy’s on-island oil storage—about four million barrels—leaving it to fuel the surviving Pacific fleet.
1941
Gas Rationing

By 1941, oil shipments from the United States to allies in Europe are impeded by German U-boat attacks. When the United States enters the war, it embarks on a nationwide rationing plan that includes gas coupons and limiting driving speed to thirty-five miles an hour. Efforts also are made to bolster U.S. oil production and transport. Meanwhile, Venezuela enacts a new “fifty-fifty” oil law, which gives the country half of all oil profits but leaves U.S. concessions in place.
1942–1945
Budding U.S.-Saudi Relations

In 1938, Saudi Arabia is found to have vast quantities of oil. In 1943, with concerns growing about the diminishing U.S. oil production capacity, President Franklin Roosevelt declares Saudi oil vital to U.S. security and provides financial support. In February 1945, Roosevelt and Saudi King Abdul Aziz meet aboard a U.S. ship on the Suez Canal to discuss closer ties. A few years later, the world’s biggest oil field is found in Saudi Arabia, and the country quickly becomes the world’s largest exporter of oil—though it does not become a significant U.S. supplier for several decades.
1943–1945
End of the War

At the end of World War II, the United States is an economic and military superpower. The country plays a central role in the global recovery, including providing energy aid to a devastated Europe. The war’s end also brings about the end of U.S. gas rationing. The U.S. auto industry booms, with the number of cars in the United States jumping from twenty-six million to forty million in the five years after the war. In the decades that follow, the transportation sector’s (mainly automobiles) share of oil consumption rises from about 50 percent to more than 70 percent.
1945
The Marshall Plan

The European Recovery Program, also known as the Marshall Plan, helps war-torn Europe get access to petroleum imports. Over the course of the forty-five-month program, the United States supplies more than $11 billion in oil aid, about 10 percent of the total aid provided by the program. The continent begins to become more dependent on oil for its energy needs as Europeans turn away from coal. But European oil needs begin to be increasingly met by the Middle East and not the United States. The United States is a net oil exporter in 1945, but by 1950 it is importing nearly one million barrels a day and within two decades the country is importing over six million barrels per day—more than a third of U.S. demand.
1948
U.S.-Iran Oil Consortium

In August 1953, the Iranian military, with the help of British and U.S. intelligence agencies, overthrows Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq—who nationalized the country’s oil industry two years earlier. The U.S. government works with U.S. oil majors and the Iranian government—now run by the Shah—to bring Iranian oil back online following a British embargo of oil shipments. Iran’s oil remains nationalized, but in October 1954 the government agrees to a consortium of mainly U.S. companies to manage Iran’s oil industry. To prevent running afoul of U.S. antitrust laws, U.S. oil majors relinquish a small portion of their share in the consortium to allow independent U.S. producers to buy in.
1954
Suez Canal Crisis

In July 1956, Egypt nationalizes the Suez Canal, which has been controlled by Britain and France. The two countries, in a coordinated attack with Israel, temporarily seize the canal in October. Half the canal’s traffic is petroleum, and the ensuing crisis from its closure threatens Middle East oil shipments, which supply about eight hundred thousand barrels a day to Europe. The intervention stokes Cold War tensions, and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower compels a withdrawal to avoid a showdown with the Soviet Union. In a 1957 speech to Congress, Eisenhower says the Middle East would be a prize for international communism and asks Congress to provide economic and military support for any nation or groups of nations in the region with “governments manifestly dedicated to the preservation of independence and resistance to subversion.”
1956–1957
Cap on U.S. Oil Imports
In 1959, the world once again faces an oversupply of oil and prices are slashed. U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower imposes the Mandatory Oil Import Program, a quota system on oil imports, so that they cannot exceed more than 9 percent of domestic consumption. The program also gives preferential treatment to Canada and Mexico. The quota lasts for fourteen years. U.S. oil prices remain stable, and eight years later are 60 percent to 70 percent above Mideast crude prices.
1959
Creation of OPEC

Arab nations, relying heavily on oil revenue, are increasingly frustrated by oil price cuts by largely Western oil companies—and by U.S. import caps, which also depress prices. In August 1960, Western oil majors once again slash prices without consulting exporting countries. In September, representatives from Iran, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela meet in Baghdad with Iraqi officials—together they represent 80 percent of the world’s crude exports. On September 14, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Nations (OPEC) is formed with the purpose of defending oil prices. However, in its initial years, OPEC exerts little influence and is virtually ignored by the U.S. government.
1960
First Arab Oil Embargo

On June 6, 1967, Israel enters into an armed conflict with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, known as the Six Day War. The next day, Arab oil ministers call for an embargo on countries friendly to Israel. Oil shipments halt to the United States and Britain. U.S. domestic production, however, surges by one million barrels a day and largely offsets the temporary loss of Mideast oil globally. By September, the embargo is lifted, and, for a short time, the world experiences another oil glut.
1967
Tehran and Tripoli Agreements

In April 1971, OPEC moves to rebalance profit sharing and oil prices and refuses to allow foreign oil companies to deal with the organization as a whole. The bloc instead forces them into separate negotiations, one for Persian Gulf producers (Tehran Agreement) and one for producers on the Mediterranean (Tripoli Agreement), resulting in higher prices. The incident marks a turning point for OPEC’s clout. Within a decade, many of OPEC’s members begin to partially or fully nationalize their oil resources and have greater influence in setting oil prices. By the end of the 1970s, international oil companies have unfettered access to just 7 percent of the world’s oil reserves, down from 85 percent in the 1960s. U.S. oil production, meanwhile, peaks in 1970 and declines about 45 percent within three decades.

End of U.S. Import Quota

U.S. spare production capacity is evaporating. Faced with a looming gasoline shortage, in April 1973 President Richard Nixon announces he is ending the Mandatory Import Program—which sets limits on oil imports—but rejects recommendations to implement conservation efforts and develop fuel alternatives. The import mandate comes two years after Nixon imposes oil price controls as part of his anti-inflation strategy. Oil imports, representing about 30 percent of U.S. consumption in 1973, increase to nearly 50 percent of consumption [PDF] within four years.

Oil Crisis

Syria and Egypt attack Israel on October 6, 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. On October 19, with the war still underway, the Nixon administration announces a $2.2 billion military aid package to Israel. Arab states respond by suspending oil shipments to nations supportive of Israel. The embargo reduces traded oil supplies by 14 percent internationally. Gasoline prices in the United States increase as much as 40 percent within a few months. Consumers in Europe, Japan, and the United States begin to panic over oil shortages. Hours-long lines at gas stations form across the United States as people start to hoard gas supplies following gas rationing and price controls. President Nixon on November 7 announces a swath of new energy policies and “Project Independence,” a goal of U.S. energy independence by 1980.

End of the Second Arab Oil Embargo

With the 1973 oil embargo after the Yom Kippur War wreaking economic havoc, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger starts “shuttle diplomacy,” helping attain disengagement between Israel and Egypt in January 1974. Arab oil ministers agree to end the embargo on March 18, 1974, on the condition that the United States also promotes Israeli-Syrian disengagement. Kissinger helps achieve an agreement between the two states in May, which includes a cease-fire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from some captured territories. The world’s top economies form the International Energy Agency to coordinate “in times of oil supply emergencies.” They also come together at a summit in France in 1975 to discuss the global economy and energy dependency. This heads-of-state forum is called the Group of Six and later becomes the G8 and then the G7.

U.S. Energy Conservation Spurred

The 1973 oil crisis spurs the U.S. Congress to mandate a fifty-five miles per hour speed limit on highways and to pass the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which establishes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and fuel efficiency standards for new automobiles. Nixon-era price controls remain on domestic oil, depressing production. Between 1974 and 1978, U.S. consumption of imports nearly doubles, and U.S. oil demand rises by about 2.1 million barrels per day. In 1977, the Carter administration organizes energy agencies into the Department of Energy. President Carter also puts out his first set of energy proposals focusing mainly on conservation, and signs legislation in 1978 to encourage fuel switching and efficiency by electric utilities and other U.S. industries.

Iranian Revolution

In October 1978, thousands of oil workers go on strike in Iran, as part of a cycle of unrest protesting leader Mohammed Reza Shah. Oil output in Iran drops from more than five million barrels a day to zero by December—amounting to about a 5 percent loss in global production. The Shah is forced to leave the country in January 1979. Exiled senior Shiite cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returns to assume control of Iran under an Islamic government. A group of Iranian students takes over the U.S. embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, taking sixty-three American hostages for more than four hundred days. President Carter responds by severing diplomatic relations and embargoing Iranian oil imports. Between January 1979 and December 1979, global oil prices more than double.

Crisis of Confidence

Iran’s revolution sparks panic over another oil-supply shortage, and oil prices double. Long gas lines return to the United States. In July, President Jimmy Carter gives his fifth major speech on energy policy, which includes announcing more energy conservation measures and a phase-out of oil price controls. A frustrated Carter admonishes the nation for worshiping “self-indulgence and consumption” and having “a crisis of confidence.” In 1980, Carter signs the Energy Security Act [PDF], which includes incentives for geothermal, solar, and biomass energy to give electricity generators new alternatives to oil. It also establishes the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corporation, intended to produce two million barrels a day in liquid fuel from non-petroleum sources like coal within five years.

Iran-Iraq War

Iran and Iraq go to war in September 1980. Though the United States is officially neutral, it renews diplomatic ties with Iraq, which have been severed since the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict. Continuing attacks on both Iraqi and Iranian oil facilities remove four million barrels a day in oil production from the global market. The Reagan administration issues a national security directive in 1983 [PDF] to increase the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf to help protect the oil facilities and shipments to allies. The war lasts eight years.
1980
Focus on Offshore Drilling

The U.S. Congress imposes a moratorium on new offshore drilling off the California coast in 1981 in response to public outcry and lingering environmental concerns caused by an oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969. Within a few years, the ban is extended to all new leases in U.S. coastal waters, except for parts of the Gulf of Mexico and some waters off the coast of Alaska. This ban continues to the present day. However, existing offshore drilling, from leases before the moratorium and from allowed parts of the Gulf and Alaska, represents about 8 percent of all U.S. production in 1981. Between increasing production in allowed offshore areas and a drop in overall U.S. production, offshore drilling rises to about 30 percent of U.S. production in the next three decades.
1981–1983
U.S. Diversifies Energy Consumption
The Reagan administration fully deregulates crude prices in 1981, allowing U.S. producers to raise prices to market levels. Non-OPEC production begins to outstrip that of OPEC—which hinders the cartel’s influence on oil prices. Global demand begins to drop due to high prices and conservation measures, and another oil surplus ensues. By 1982, the United States imports about 28 percent of its oil, down from more than 45 percent in 1977. By 1985, U.S. fuel economy averages for automobiles reach nearly 28 mpg, up from 20 mpg in 1978, and consumer fuel switching for heating and electricity helps lower oil consumption. Oil prices drop from a yearly average of $35 per barrel in 1981 to less than $15 in 1986. The collapse in price encourages oil companies to shift to cheaper foreign exploration, and U.S. imports begin to steadily rise again.

Exxon Valdez Oil Spill

The super tanker Exxon Valdez strikes a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilling eleven million barrels of oil and damaging coastline and fisheries. Considered one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history, the spill—and its $2 billion cleanup cost—bolsters the environmental movement and leads to policies that further restrict offshore drilling. In 1990, Congress passes the Oil Pollution Act [PDF] for offshore accidents, which creates a three-tiered emergency response plan for spills, caps liability for operators of offshore facilities, and establishes a trust fund that makes up to $1 billion available for each spill incident.

Iraq's Invasion of Kuwait

Iraq invades Kuwait on August 2, 1990, following a dispute over the Rumaila oil field on the border. In a speech on August 8, 1990, President George H.W. Bush says Iraq’s aggression poses an economic threat to the United States, which now imports half its oil. Bush also declares the “sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia [a] vital interest” and deploys troops to the country. Nations dependent on Persian Gulf imports, such as Japan, provide much of the funding for a U.S.-led, multinational military effort to liberate Kuwait in January 1991. The Bush administration releases thirty-four million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in anticipation of an oil shock, but contrary to predictions, oil prices drop from about $30 per barrel in September to less than $20 in January. Iraq surrenders in late February 1991.

A Nation of SUVs

In 1993, the Clinton administration announces a partnership to develop and produce affordable, fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles. But inexpensive oil and a booming economy drive up consumption in the United States. While European and Japanese car companies move ahead with commercialization of the first hybrid passenger vehicle, sales of gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles (SUVs)—considered light trucks and thus exempted from tougher U.S. fuel economy standards—explode. SUVs make up a large part of the fleet of U.S. automakers, garnering significant profits in comparison to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. Between 1993 and the country’s record demand for oil in 2005, consumption increases by 3.6 million barrels a day to 20.8 million barrels per day.

Kyoto Protocol

In 1997, most of the world’s leaders sign the Kyoto Protocol, an international mechanism for countries to reduce and adapt to rising greenhouse gas levels in order to mitigate climate change. But the United States, the largest greenhouse emitter of the time, refuses to ratify the treaty and for the next decade faces international criticism for its slow adoption of emissions-reduction policies. And though a third of manmade emissions come from petroleum, U.S. policy on oil consumption remains focused on energy security and air quality. Environmental advocates target the U.S. oil and auto industries for lobbying against climate policy in the country for the next decade.

Birth of the Super Majors

Asia’s economic crisis in 1997 causes a drop in demand in what has been a growth region for oil markets. Though OPEC tightens its oil production quota, global prices plunge to below $10 per barrel at the end of 1998, down from nearly $20 per barrel in late 1997. The downturn, plus an increasingly constrained environment for oil concessions globally, encourages a string of oil mergers among the world’s largest private oil companies, including ones between BP and Amoco (the largest foreign takeover of a U.S. company to date), Exxon and Mobil, and Texaco and Chevron. Accused of stifling competition, these mergers face political scrutiny [PDF] in the next decade as U.S. gas prices increase significantly.
1998–2001
New Assertive Oil Powers

In February 1999, Hugo Chavez assumes office as president of Venezuela, and embarks on a social revolution that includes financing new social programs with the country’s oil revenues. Venezuela continues to be one of the largest sources of U.S. oil imports, but Chavez is increasingly critical of U.S. foreign policy over the course of the next decade and threatens repeatedly to cut off oil shipments. In 1999, Vladimir Putin takes office as president of Russia, which has the largest conventional oil reserves outside of OPEC. Both Venezuela and Russia nationalize much of their oil resources and restrict access by international oil companies.

Canada Overtakes Saudi Arabia

In 2004, Canada surpasses Saudi Arabia as the largest single exporter of oil to the United States, providing 1.6 million barrels per day compared to the Saudi’s 1.5 million barrels. A decade before, Canada begins investing heavily to develop its oil sands, which requires more money and effort to extract and refine than conventional oil. Many estimate oil sands place the country’s oil reserves second to Saudi Arabia. In 1999, oil sands represent about 15 percent of total Canadian crude production, but by 2010 oil sand production is nearly half. Still, heavily polluting oil sand production increasingly becomes an environmental concern.
2004
Renewable Fuel Support
In 2005, the U.S. Congress passes the Energy Policy Act, which includes new incentives for transportation fuel alternatives and flex-fuel cars as well as new subsidies for domestic oil exploration. The law mandates that 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels be blended into gasoline by 2012. In his 2006 State of the Union address, U.S. President George W. Bush says “America is addicted to oil.” The law is criticized for adding billions in federal subsidies to the oil industry, and subsidies of corn-based biofuel are criticized as a threat to food security and the environment. Some energy experts criticize U.S. tariffs on Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, which is cheaper and more energy efficient to produce.
2005
Skyrocketing Oil Prices

In 2006, a time of near record-high U.S. oil consumption and imports, oil prices begin to rise steadily, topping a record $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008. This translates to gasoline averages above $4 per gallon in much of country. Experts debate the cause of the record prices, blaming it on factors such as the economic rise of China and India, commodity market speculation, and basic issues of supply. Fuel prices and high food prices begin to cause unrest around the world. In the United States, high gas prices in a presidential election year invigorate debate about increasing domestic production, especially ending the moratorium on offshore drilling and in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. “Drill baby drill” becomes a rallying cry for the Republican Party. Shortly after the global financial crisis begins in 2008, oil prices plummet.

Energy Independence and Security Act

In 2007, Congress passes the Energy Independence and Security Act, which will increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards from 27.5 mpg to 35 mpg by 2020, and ends the light truck exclusion. The law also mandates greater production of non-corn-based ethanol, and requires biofuels blended with gasoline and diesel to be at least 20 percent less in greenhouse gas lifecycle emissions than the petroleum-based fuels. In May 2009, the Obama administration announces accelerated CAFE standards of 39 mpg for cars and 30 mpg for light trucks, which the administration highlighted as part of its climate change policy goals.

BP Oil Spill

In the spring of 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama lays out his plans for U.S. energy policy, including supporting more biofuels and opening more U.S. waters to offshore oil drilling. But in April, a deepwater drilling rig explodes and sinks in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a massive, four-month oil spill. The Obama administration, in response, places a temporary ban on all new offshore drilling projects in order to review U.S. safety and environmental enforcement. Calls renew for strengthened measures to reduce U.S. oil consumption, now at less than nineteen million barrels per day, down nearly two million barrels from 2005 record levels.

Libya Rocks Oil Markets

In February 2011, Libya becomes the first major oil-producing nation to join a spate of popular uprisings in the region, which topples regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. With the largest reserves in Africa, Libya represents about 2 percent of global oil production. Global oil prices spike nearly 10 percent in one day. Though the country does not supply oil to the United States, concerns grow that the situation in Libya and potential unrest in other oil-producing nations could lead to a new global oil crisis. In a March 30 speech, U.S. President Barack Obama says: “We will keep on being a victim to shifts in the oil market until we get serious about a long-term policy for secure, affordable energy.” He pledges to reduce U.S. oil dependence by one-third within a decade.

U.S. Releases Oil from Strategic Reserve

The Obama administration announces it will release thirty million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve over thirty days. The administration says the move is to offset the loss of Libya’s 1.5 million bpd in output since civil war erupted in February. The U.S. release coincides with the release of another thirty million barrels from the reserves of other members of the International Energy Agency. The IEA says “greater tightness in the oil market threatens to undermine the fragile global economic recovery.” The coordinated release comes after OPEC ministers fail to agree to greater output. The U.S. reserve sale represents the fourth major drawdown since the reserve’s initiation in 1977. The administration’s decision draws criticism from some analysts and political opponents for its timing, rationale, political overtones, and uncertain impact on oil markets.
February 2014
U.S. Oil Imports Hit Two-Decade Low
Imports of crude oil and petroleum products fall to less than 260,000 barrels per day, the lowest in almost two decades, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The reduced reliance on foreign oil is the result of both declining demand and a domestic energy revolution which, through the combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, unlocked vast reserves of “tight oil” in shale rock formations. Tight oil production surges from less than one million barrels a day in 2010 to over four million barrels a day by December 2015, exceeding the individual production of every OPEC member except Saudi Arabia.

OPEC Meets as Global Oil Prices Tumble

U.S. tight oil producers contribute to a global supply glut that puts downward pressure on prices. By November, crude oil falls below $75 a barrel, down from $110 in June. OPEC members meet in Vienna, where, despite opposition from some members who want to cut OPEC oil production to halt the price slide, Saudi Arabia pushes the group to maintain a production target of thirty million barrels per day. The organization meets and regularly exceeds that target, leading to further price declines below $50 a barrel by early 2015, which squeezes the finances of oil-exporting countries and forces unconventional drillers in the United States to curb costs and sharply cut production.

Obama Administration Rejects Keystone XL Pipeline

President Barack Obama rejects the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported more than eight hundred thousand barrels of oil per day from Canada to Texas. Subject to multiple rounds of State Department review since its conception in 2008, supporters said it would have created jobs and enhanced energy security, while opponents worried about potential damage to the environment from spills and increased carbon emissions. Debate over the merits of the cross-border pipeline will continue, as TransCanada, the company behind the project, files a lawsuit against the U.S. government charging discriminatory treatment under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Congress Lifts Oil-Export Ban
Congress votes to lift four-decade-old restrictions on U.S. crude oil exports, and a shipment immediately leaves the port of Corpus Christi, Texas, for sale in Europe. The shipment consists of light sweet crude oil drawn from south Texas’s Eagle Ford shale deposits. Even as the United States continues to import oil, opportunities for exports will arise since many of the country’s existing refineries are not optimized to process the type of light crude drawn from shale. However, most analysts believe that the impact on production, prices, and geopolitics of lifting the restrictions will be modest.

Paris Agreement

The Paris Agreement—signed by more than 190 countries, including the United States—enters into force. The most ambitious climate accord to date, the agreement requires all parties to set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the goal of arresting the rise in the average global temperature. Countries also agree to aim for net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century. The United States pledges to cut its emissions by more than 25 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, a move that requires transitioning away from fossil fuels, including oil. Although the accord does not include enforcement mechanisms, there are periodic performance reviews meant to encourage countries to adopt more ambitious targets.

Trump’s ‘America First’ Energy Plan

After campaigning on a promise to boost U.S. oil production and achieve energy independence, President Donald Trump begins rolling back his predecessor’s policies. In June, Trump announces the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which takes effect in November 2020. His administration later scraps Obama’s tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, which the Environmental Protection Agency says will result in about two billion more barrels of oil consumed. The U.S. fracking boom continues, with the administration leasing four million acres of federal land to fossil fuel companies. Trump also revives the Keystone XL pipeline and, with support from the Republican-controlled Congress, opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska for oil drilling despite opposition from Democrats, environmental activists, and some Alaska Native groups. Alaskan lawmakers and other Alaska Native groups support the move due to the expected revenue and job growth.

COVID-19 Pandemic

The world is rocked by the emergence of a new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that quickly becomes a global pandemic. Response measures, including stay-at-home orders, trigger a sharp drop in the demand for oil. Falling oil prices create a rift within OPEC and lead to a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, with Riyadh ramping up production to further slash prices in an effort to force Moscow to the table. Oil prices hit rock bottom; in April, a major benchmark price for U.S. crude oil briefly falls below zero for the first time in history. After Whiting Petroleum Corporation, a major U.S. producer, declares bankruptcy, President Trump attempts to broker an OPEC deal to prevent further damage to the U.S. industry. After Trump intervenes, OPEC and Russia agree to curb production and raise prices.

Biden’s New Direction

President Joe Biden is sworn into office and promises to take aggressive action on climate change. He rejoins the Paris Agreement and pledges to cut U.S. emissions by at least 50 percent of 2005 levels by 2030—and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. To reach that goal, Biden calls for a return to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, as well as measures to spur the use of electric vehicles, among other proposals. Biden cancels the Keystone XL pipeline and suspends drilling leases in the ANWR. However, approval for drilling on other federal lands continues at a record pace. As the pandemic abates in the United States, demand for oil rebounds and gas prices surge to a seven-year high.

Russia’s War With Ukraine

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes turmoil in global oil markets. Biden blocks U.S. imports of oil from Russia, and Western sanctions cause energy companies to withdraw from the country. Oil prices, already rising in the wake of the pandemic, surge to their highest level since 2008. In response to near-record gasoline prices, U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle call for boosting domestic oil production, though some in Congress urge a quicker transition to renewable energy. The United States and other members of the International Energy Agency announce plans to collectively release sixty million barrels of oil from strategic reserves. Meanwhile, the Biden administration considers smoothing rocky relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela in the hope that those countries will supply more oil. Senior U.S. officials travel to Caracas for the first time since 2019, and the Biden administration pushes to finalize negotiations on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and lifting U.S. sanctions on Tehran.

U.S. Oil Production Reaches Record High As Climate Concerns Mount

U.S. crude oil production surpasses thirteen million barrels a day for the first time, making the United States the world’s largest producer of the commodity. The surge in production keeps U.S. gasoline prices low despite several rounds of voluntary production cuts by the OPEC+ coalition, which includes Russia. However, the United States still imports more than it exports amid high domestic energy demand and a mismatch between refining capacity and the type of crude oil produced by U.S. shale fields. Meanwhile, some governments push for a global deal to phase out fossil fuels at the year-end COP28 summit, citing their contribution to climate change and the year’s record heat.

MIDDLE EAST PROGRAM
OVERVIEW
The Middle East Program at the Wilson Center, the Middle East Institute and the American Task Force of Lebanon are pleased to host the launch of Ambassador David Hale’s book: American Diplomacy Toward Lebanon: Lessons in Foreign Policy and the Middle East. Ambassador Hale, a Global Fellow at the Wilson Center and former Ambassador to Lebanon, examines several key episodes in US diplomatic history with Lebanon, starting with the country's independence in 1943 up until the present moment. Crucial events, such as the Lebanese Civil War, the Cedar Revolution, and, more recently, the spillover from the Syrian Civil War are examined within the context of the respective US government administrations of the time and their foreign policy strategies. Hale asks whether policy-makers had realistic and compelling goals, the right strategy, sufficient means, and capable diplomats in their diplomatic approaches towards Lebanon through the years.

BOTTOM LINE
Israeli “collective punishment” of Gaza threatens to upend decades of US policy in the Middle East, particularly the possibility that Iranian surrogates or proxies escalate the conflict or open up new fronts in the Levant or the Gulf.
Egypt and Jordan cannot afford the risks associated with further instability and insecurity along their borders or within their territory. 
The Biden administration has a unique opportunity to shape the conflict in ways that better guarantees Israeli security and international standing, supports Gulf Cooperation Council state-led regional de-escalation, and opens up new opportunities for Palestinian socioeconomic recovery and reintegration.
The Hamas incursion from Gaza into Israel and the subsequent attack on Israel’s Southern District that began on October 7, 2023, led to the death of more than 1,500 Israelis and foreigners. The atrocities, widely reported as Israel’s 9/11, have been met with international condemnation, along with support for Israel, especially from the United States. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken traveled to the Middle East, followed by President Joe Biden, who traveled to Israel on October 18, 2023. He hugged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog on the tarmac immediately after Air Force One landed. Since then, the United States has moved warships and aircraft into position adjacent to Israel along with 2,000 troops to “provide intelligence and surveillance, transportation and medical assistance.”
However, David Petraeus, who served as CIA director, as well as commander in Iraq and Afghanistan in the years after 9/11, and Biden, have both urged Israel not to repeat US mistakes during its so-called “War on Terror.” These mistakes are often cited as a lack of post-war planning and state-building in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as human rights abuses. Similar to both wars, the war against Hamas lacks a military solution and requires a diplomatic approach. This needs to be considered sooner rather than later, before more than two million lives are put at risk by Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza and regional escalation becomes a manifest reality. 
At the time of the incursion, Hamas announced that it had also taken around 199 hostages back into Gaza. The group has since released two US hostages on October 21 (through a combination of US and Qatari diplomacy), and two more on October 23. Following the beginning of an Israeli ground offensive into Gaza, an Israeli soldier was freed on October 31. However, Hamas stated on November 4 that more than sixty hostages were missing after Israeli air strikes, highlighting the role that mediators or a prisoner swap might play in securing the release of the majority of hostages and thereby helping to resolve the immediate rationale for the invasion of Gaza. 
There have already been devastating air strikes on Gaza resulting in more deaths than the original Hamas attack. More than 9,000 Palestinians had lost their lives as of November 3, many of them children. In one air strike on the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital on October 17, at least 500 people were killed, although it is still not clear which side is responsible for this. Israeli air strikes have taken place in the West Bank (including against a mosque in Jenin which Israel says was being used by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to plan attacks) and Syria. On November 4, Israel attacked an ambulance convoy said to be transporting Hamas fighters. Israeli airstrikes in supposed areas of safety in the South of Gaza have led the United Nations and other aid agencies to claim that nowhere is safe for civilians in Gaza. Such actions raise questions about proportionality in Israel’s right to defend itself from future attacks, the conditions in which Gazans have been forced to live in for decades, widely regarded as being an “open air prison,” and discrimination of military versus civilian targets under international humanitarian law during what is expected to be a complex counter-insurgency campaign. An Israeli red line was finally crossed when right-wing  Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu suggested dropping a nuclear weapon on Gaza as “an option.” He was subsequently suspended by Netanyahu, but only temporarily, given that this exceeded the prime minister’s authority. 
Neither international diplomacy nor the prospect of regional conflict, primarily vis-à-vis Hezbollah in Lebanon, and/or against the Quds Force in Syria and Iraq, is expected to constrain Israel’s use of force. Hezbollah’s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, congratulated Hamas on the surprise attack but stopped short of declaring military support and is keeping the situation under review. Iran is unlikely to directly intervene in the Gaza war given the options it has and its broader regional and regime survival interests. But Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen have already targeted the Israeli Red Sea town of Eilat, threatening the prospects for peace in Yemen. 
Initial Israeli military action and the anticipated US veto of a Brazil-sponsored draft UN Security Council resolution that called for a “humanitarian pause” has already led Jordan to cancel a summit involving Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, Jordan’s King Abdullah, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, said the meeting, initially scheduled for October 18, would go ahead when the parties could agree to end the “war and massacres against Palestinians.” Instead, Egypt and Jordan “affirmed their unified position rejecting the policy of collective punishment in siege, starvation or displacement” of Palestinians. Egypt then held a peace summit in Cairo on October 21, but senior Israeli and US officials were not in attendance, and the summit ended without a breakthrough. When the UN secretary-general made similar remarks to these regional states on the “collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, called for the UN chief to resign immediately on October 24. 
Much diplomacy has so far centered on Egypt and Jordan as two neighboring states of Gaza and the West Bank, respectively. Both states have bilateral relations with Israel and, along with Lebanon and the West Bank, could bear the brunt of any substantive changes in the shape and form of the Israel-Palestine conflict, such as a third intifada. Jordan is home to some 2 million Palestinian refugees, as well as an additional 1.4 million Syrian refugees. Shrinking incomes, rising prices, and debt are fueling poverty rates, making further refugee camps unthinkable. This refugee burden, when combined with its relatively small population, small territory, and lack of economic resources, has continued to make Jordan dependent on Western and Arab Gulf aid. The Jordanian government continues to receive US security assistance to support and develop Jordanian military capacity, including an allocation of up to $500 million for border security. 
Egypt has a common border with Gaza and a single crossing at Rafah which is a vital conduit for humanitarian aid. Egypt has said that it did not close this crossing, but Israeli strikes had made the site inoperable. Clearly, this is under constant review and pressure, leading to the crossing opening to just twenty Egyptian trucks delivering aid for Gaza’s population of 2.3 million on October 21 from multiple regional and international parties, although further deliveries have taken place since and are expected to continue. The Rafah crossing was briefly opened on November 1 for the evacuation of dozens of injured Palestinians to be treated at an Egyptian hospital on the border and for the evacuation of hundreds of foreign passport holders. Qatar appears to have led on the agreement with Hamas and Egypt in this case. Egypt has worked on Gaza with states such as Qatar, Turkey, and Germany in the past, especially when Israeli-Gazan wars threatened its security in 2014 and 2021. Qatar has supported Gaza with hundreds of millions of dollars to help pay for fuel, electricity, and public sector salaries, including a $360 million package pledged in 2021. The leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, has lived in Doha since 2020. With such a close political relationship, Qatar is in prime position to expand on its mediation credentials with significant results on hostages, which could still help to contain the conflict in terms of duration and the amount of devastation caused. 
Sisi’s primary concern appears to be in avoiding another Nakba or Palestinian catastrophe when much of the Palestinian homeland was systematically destroyed in 1948. It led to the permanent displacement of approximately 700,000 Palestinians to camps in the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. During the Camp David Accords in 1978, in the lead-up to the Egypt-Israel peace treaty that was signed in 1979, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin had initially refused to dismantle Israeli settlements in Sinai and only later agreed to let the Knesset decide the fate of such settlements. Such incidents are bound to play into Egyptian calculations about the Gaza border. Egypt already hosts many refugees and migrants from a number of countries, most recently including Syria. Despite the prevalence of domestic support for the Palestinian cause, there is now great trepidation at both the governmental and social levels that opening the border at Rafah for refugees from Gaza could encourage Iran and its surrogates to benefit from a new supply line to Hamas, one which the Egyptian military has spent considerable time and effort in addressing. Such a move without adequate controls would no doubt result in new Palestinian camps in the Sinai Peninsula, which has happened elsewhere in the region, and would be near-impossible to dismantle. Hamas and affiliate factions could move across the border during the subsequent melee. There is also a high probability that broader Palestinian radicalization could occur in response to the latest bout of violence, a worry shared by many states. In addition, the transfer of weapons such as drones and rockets into Egypt could pose a direct security threat to its national security, to Israel, and other states. Any changes to the status quo could significantly complicate the current Egyptian-Israeli fight against Islamic State and other extremist elements already in Sinai and result in a general deterioration in the Egyptian security environment. 
For Egypt, this is in addition to instability on its western and southern borders, in Libya and Sudan respectively, alongside domestic issues already identified during the Arab Spring a decade ago, as well as rising external debt and the cost of living, food insecurity (especially wheat imports undermined by the war in Ukraine), and questions about US military sales to Egypt following the alleged Menendez scandal. 
Much more international cooperation will be required, and pressure will be especially acute on the southern Gaza-Egypt border as the Israeli invasion progresses in the north. The Israeli military has already cut off water and fuel and ordered the evacuation of 1.1 million people from northern Gaza. The Gulf Cooperation Council states have moved at various speeds to support Gaza with aid. Saudi Arabia announced $17 million in aid on the first day of its fundraiser on November 2. But there remains concern about regional spillover, especially in the West Bank, which provided the context for Blinken’s visit to Abbas in Ramallah on November 5.
Saudi Arabia will be eager to avoid further escalation, especially in the Gulf. The danger of Iranian hostility was on display during the 2019 attacks on Khurais and Abqaiq oil installations that temporarily knocked out 50 percent of its oil output and raised questions about the safety of Saudi Arabia’s Mega or Giga projects. Saudi-US-Israeli talks on normalization have been slowed by negotiations on arms, US security provisions, and civil nuclear components. Negotiations are now said to be frozen rather than canceled. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has recently re-emphasized Palestinian statehood based on 1967 borders in line with Saudi leadership of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, although fighting in East Jerusalem and around Al Aqsa mosque will complicate matters considerably. 
The United Arab Emirates has been cognizant for some time that a degree of balancing is required to advance stability in the Gulf, including leading de-escalation and interaction with Iran and deciding to withdraw from the US-led maritime coalition in May 2023. Having signed the Abraham Accords to at least in part help freeze Israeli settlement activity, the Emirates has so far attempted to maintain the status quo by differentiating its trade policy from political issues. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain remain politically exposed during this crisis and, like Saudi Arabia, will be eager to avoid regional conflagration during a vital period of economic diversification, and in the lead up to it hosting the COP28 climate meeting in November and December 2023. 
To seriously weaken Hamas would probably require massive devastation of its underground infrastructure, requiring large bombs such as those used in strikes at Jabaliya refugee camp on October 9, as well as a bloody counter-insurgency campaign. In this case, it is likely an equally militant group will take over or be created, since support for Hamas has generally increased each time it has engaged Israel in defense of Jerusalem and the holy sites located there, as well as wider resistance against Israel’s restrictive policies towards Gaza. Blinken has already told a Senate Appropriations Committee that “We can’t have a reversion to the status quo with Hamas running Gaza.” 
The Biden administration should take a series of steps to shape the conflict before escalation turns into a deeper quagmire which could undermine a wide raft of US interests in the Middle East, as well as further destabilize regional and international security. 
First, Biden should use his popularity in Israel to influence the Israeli government to exercise the utmost restraint in pursuing Hamas at all costs to the wider Gazan population. At a minimum, it should ensure water, food, electricity, and medicine supplies are reconnected, and that Israel, as an occupying force, undertakes its obligations under international humanitarian law. 
Second, the Biden administration should work closely with the Palestinian Authority, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt to guard against conflict spillover and ensure stability in border areas, facilitate the release of all remaining hostages, and work with any other intermediaries deemed necessary to achieve a ceasefire. 
Third, the Biden administration could then work with other members of the UN Security Council to set up a viable multinational force to ensure Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, establish Gaza-Israel border security, and the decommissioning of Hamas’ weapons. China might support such a move given its energy interests and therefore need for stability in the region largely converge with those of the United States and the European Union. Given that Russia and China blocked a US-drafted UN Security Council resolution backing Israel’s right to self-defense, a change of tack like this might be more successful. 
Fourth, similar to the circumstances after the 1990-1991 Gulf War, when the United States and Soviet Union spearheaded the Madrid Conference to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Biden administration could use the crisis as an opportunity for further diplomacy. This is essential because unlike the American “unipolar moment” then, US influence in the world is now at a low ebb, especially in the Middle East after years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, inaction over Syria and Yemen, unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and escalation with Iran. Work should begin on a series of measures, initially with some Gulf states, designed to address the living conditions of millions of Palestinians affected by this conflict. Humanitarian aid for Gaza looks set to be included in the $14.3 billion Israel aid bill passed by the US House of Representatives on November 2. Building a sustainable form of political representation in Gaza that effectively advances Palestinian rights will be more difficult. 
The United States could go on to liaise with Russia and/or the European Union and United Nations to task the Office of the Quartet Representative to begin surveying the millions of Palestinian refugees to gauge their preferences concerning the “right of return” under UN General Assembly Resolution 194, or on alternatives such as reparations or definitive resettlement. Even tentative steps in this area, which could take many months or even years to achieve, would signal a substantive shift in US policy but could form part of a diplomatic surge on Ukraine targeting the Global South. It may immediately quell some of the backlash from Arab leaders on Israeli tactics during the conflict, stymie Netanyahu’s policy of increased settlement expansion in the West Bank (when coupled with other forms of US diplomacy), and eventually advance a US role in Mideast peace which has been lacking for many years. Importantly, coming into a US presidential election cycle, the result could far supersede President Donald Trump’s coercive regional approach and the limited foreign policy “win” of the initial Abraham Accords.

The aftermath of Hamas’s brutal October 7 attack on Israel, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, has prompted what is arguably the most severe challenge to U.S. strategy in the Middle East since the uprisings and civil wars that rocked the Arab world beginning in 2011. Israel’s assault on the Gaza Strip and the massive loss of life it has incurred—over 12,000 Palestinians have died as a result, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry—have spurred widespread anti-Americanism across the region and prompted attacks by Iranian proxies on U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Syria. How U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration manage the actions of Israel, a close U.S. ally, as well as the broader geopolitical reverberations of the war, will have far-reaching consequences for regional stability as well as for Washington’s ability to confront and deter adversaries in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Testing Assumptions About US Foreign Policy in 2024
Members of the Reimagining US Grand Strategy team examine key assumptions about US foreign policy that will be tested this year

In Grand Strategy
January 16, 2024
There are major questions facing U.S. foreign policy in 2024. The U.S. presidential election, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, relations with China, and global economic challenges will all test the United States and its policymakers. Members of the Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy team examined assumptions that they believe are central to U.S. foreign policy, and which are likely to be tested in 2024. Each author identifies and unpacks a key aspect of the conventional wisdom, and then assesses whether that prevailing view holds up, or whether policymakers should adjust their approach in light of new realities.
Conventional wisdom: Elections don’t hinge on foreign policy
Christopher Preble
Director
History teaches that foreign policy does not move elections. Consider the case of George H. W. Bush vs. Bill Clinton in 1992. After the United States successfully expelled Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi forces from Kuwait, Bush’s approval rating was 89 percent.
But by July 1992, fewer than three in ten Americans approved of Bush’s performance. And, six months later, he was out of office, bested by the Arkansas governor (with an assist from Texas billionaire Ross Perot). The Clinton campaign’s unofficial mantra, “it’s the economy, stupid,” forever enshrined the sense that successful candidates must be laser-focused on Americans’ economic well-being and a concern for life here at home.
There have been exceptions, however. In the 2006 midterms, frustration over the Iraq War was devastating for Republicans. In making the case for war four years earlier, the George W. Bush administration had tapped into concerns about terrorism, with war advocates claiming a “connection” between Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Moreover, the war was supposed to be over quickly and cost little. None of these assertions proved to be accurate. Though the U.S. economy was doing relatively well in November 2006 — the financial crisis was still a year away — the unpopular war was an albatross around the GOP’s neck. The Democrats won six seats in the Senate, and 31 in the House, securing control of both chambers.
Another exception to the “foreign-policy-doesn’t-move-elections” rule played out in 2016. At a memorable debate in South Carolina on February 13, 2016, Donald Trump attacked George W. Bush for lying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and for his poor judgement in getting the country into a war that cost $2 trillion. It was all “a big, fat mistake,” Trump thundered. Then-Florida Governor Jeb Bush won cheers and applause from the crowd when he defended his brother’s decisions, but Trump won the votes in the South Carolina primary just a week later.
Trump continued to hammer foreign policy themes in the general election campaign with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, castigating her for her early support for the Iraq War, and intimating that Clinton was likely to entangle the United States in more foreign wars. “Trump’s ability to connect with voters in communities exhausted by more than fifteen years of war,” concluded researchers Douglas Kriner and Francis Shen, “may have been critically important to his narrow election victory.”
So, what does 2024 portend? Recent polling by the Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago suggests that Americans are much more concerned about foreign policy than they have been in the recent past. For example, when asked to name up to five issues that they wanted the government to work on in 2024, 38% of Americans identified foreign policy, the second-leading issue behind the economy. Foreign policy had registered a mere 18% in a similar poll a year ago. And, in the most recent AP/NORC survey, 20% of respondents worried about “U.S. involvement overseas” a four-fold increase from before.
In comparing Biden’s and Trump’s likely foreign policies, voters will have to separate words from actions. Biden has steadfastly refused to send U.S. personnel to fight in Ukraine and has mostly resisted calls for escalation that would have increased the risk of U.S. forces being drawn in inadvertently — e.g., no-fly zones. But his unwavering support for Israel’s war in Gaza has divided Democrats and could cost him votes, including in Michigan, a critical swing state in the election.
For his part, as president, Trump ordered the assassination of a senior Iranian general, an act that brought the United States close to the brink of war with Iran. He had wanted to remove troops from Syria, but he was convinced that the U.S. presence there would be helpful for his other goal, seizing Syria’s oil. (It wasn’t, and he didn’t.) Similarly, instead of ending the U.S. war in Afghanistan, Trump sent more troops there. Biden ended the unpopular war in August 2021, but his own popularity dipped below 50% for the first time following the withdrawal of U.S. troops that month — and Biden hasn’t recovered since.
In short, Trump’s professed opposition to U.S. military intervention did not manifest during his term in office. Biden’s instinct to end one war did not signal a determination to avoid all other foreign entanglements. And, most important, U.S. relations with China — the world’s second-largest country, have trended steadily downward under both presidents. Neither Trump nor Biden has a plan for setting US-China relations right.
Be that as it may, Trump seems poised to wield foreign policy to his advantage. In a November CBS/YouGov poll, 49% of respondents believed that a Biden victory would increase the chances of the United States becoming involved in a war, whereas 43% believed that a Trump victory made U.S. involvement less likely. In that same poll, 47% thought Trump’s policies “would increase peace and stability”; only 31% held that opinion of a second Biden term.
So, keep an eye on foreign policy in the election this year. It is rarely decisive, but it can tip the scales in a close race, which 2024 promises to be.
Conventional wisdom: US-China relations will get worse in 2024
Evan Cooper
Research Associate
One of the last U.S. foreign policy news stories of 2023 focused on an exchange between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco in November. According to reports, Xi made clear China’s intention to reunify Taiwan but pushed back against assessments made by U.S. military leaders that China might launch an attack against the island in 2025 or 2027.
Although much of the U.S. media’s coverage of the meeting between the two leaders framed the interaction as driving the two countries toward conflict, instead their meeting should be seen as a productive exchange that furthers the Biden administration’s efforts to stabilize relations between Beijing and Washington. Numerous points of significant tension remain between China and the United States, but the shift in the Biden administration’s approach to diplomatic engagement signals that the nadir in US-China relations may have passed for the duration of Biden’s first term.
Although the coverage of the APEC summit focused on Xi’s forceful position on Taiwan, the public statements from both the United States and China following the meeting between the two leaders were positive. The two sides announced that they would resume high-level military-to-military communication, cooperate on cracking down on the production of illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl, and collaborate on safety guidelines around the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Representatives of the two sides acknowledged substantial differences, but there was a broadly shared commitment to continue to work toward improved relations.
These statements were a continuation of the increased diplomacy between the United States and China in 2023. Exchanges between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and their Chinese counterparts represent a major diplomatic push and a marked shift from the lack of direct dialogue between the two countries during the first two years of the Biden administration. Secretary Yellen plans to visit China again in 2024, and the United States is willing to expand dialogue further. Following the APEC summit, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin pledged to “seek practical discussions with [the Chinese] from a senior leader level to the working level.”
Beyond dialogues and summits, some concrete steps taken by the United States and China indicate an intent to find areas for cooperation rather than engaging solely in competition. In 2023, negotiations led to an increase in flights between the two countries, with even more planned in 2024, an important step for allowing the people-to-people exchanges that both sides agreed should be increased at the APEC summit. In addition, the United States lifted restrictions on 27 Chinese firms, paving the way for productive discussions between U.S. Commerce Secretary Raimondo and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who concluded their meeting by saying, “I’m ready to work with you together to foster a more favorable policy environment, for stronger cooperation between our businesses to bolster bilateral trade and investment in a stable and predictable manner.”
Despite signs of the United States and China working toward establishing a floor under the relationship – ensuring there is at least a minimum level of cooperation – there is a substantial risk of relations devolving in 2024. The U.S. presidential campaign is likely to feature hawkish rhetoric toward China from both the Democratic and Republican candidates, as well as those in races further down the ticket. China’s behavior may only fuel that dynamic as Beijing continues to stake its claims more aggressively in the South China Sea and elsewhere. Furthermore, the outcome of the 2024 Taiwanese elections may pose a major challenge to the current trajectory of increased US-China cooperation because the new Taiwanese leadership may prove to be far more aggressively pro-independence than President Tsai Ing-Wen. But as long as both Beijing and Washington see the benefits of continuing high-level dialogue and committing to pursue narrow agreements on shared interests, the relationship may be able to withstand domestic pressures.
Conventional wisdom: Europe is willing to join with the United States to counter China’s growing power and influence
Kelly Grieco
Senior Fellow
The Biden administration’s alliance strategy to counter China’s geopolitical rise is nothing if not ambitious; its National Security Strategy called for “creating a latticework of strong, resilient, and mutually reinforcing relationships that prove democracies can deliver for their people and world” and forging “new ways to integrate our alliances in the Indo-Pacific and Europe and develop new and deeper means of cooperation.”
But next July, as Washington hosts a NATO summit to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the alliance, this approach will face a key test. Contrary to the administration’s hopes and expectations, however, the United States’ European allies are unlikely to align more closely with the U.S. on China.
To many in Washington, the war in Ukraine serves as a case for building a transregional coalition of democracies. In the wake of Russian aggression, Washington and its democratic allies — both those in Europe and Asia — quickly came together in support of Ukraine’s right to self-defense, publicly condemning Russia’s actions, imposing a series of unprecedented financial and trade sanctions on Russia, and sending billions in arms and other assistance to Ukraine. Encouraged by this moment of democratic solidarity, the Biden team now hopes to repeat its success.
“What we’re seeing now is an unprecedented level of Asian interest and focus,” in joining with the United States and Europe to “sustain a country under siege,” Kurt M. Campbell, the White House Coordinator for the Indo-Pacific said only days after the start of the war in Ukraine. “And I believe one of the outcomes of this tragedy will be a kind of new thinking around how to solidify institutional connections beyond what we’ve already seen between Europe and the Pacific,” he added. The Biden administration has been building on this momentum, attempting to draw Europe into a balancing coalition with its liberal democratic allies in Asia against China.
At last year’s NATO summit, Washington succeeded in placing the China challenge near the top of the agenda. When the alliance released its new Strategic Concept, the second-most important political document after NATO’s founding treaty, it sounded a tough new tone, declaring China’s “stated ambitions and coercive policies” as constituting “systemic challenges” to transatlantic security. Since then, Washington has pushed Europeans to adopt more stringent export control and outbound investment standards in their economic relations with China.
At first glance, the White House seems to have had some success with these efforts. In October, for example, the European Commission unveiled a list of four critical technologies — quantum computing, biotechnology, advanced semiconductors, and AI — that it seeks to prevent from falling into the hands of rivals. But the list is far more notable for what it left out — any mention of China by name, as well as a host of other cutting-edge technologies, like renewable energy and electronic vehicles.
The reality is that Europe remains deeply divided over China policy. Three years into the Biden administration, many European allies — including France and Germany — are still wary of adopting a hawkish stance toward Beijing. Both countries have pushed back against European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s calls for de-risking economic ties with China. Significantly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has insisted that de-risking is “mainly about decisions that need to be taken by companies,” not a government policy. Germany has pushed ahead with business and investments in China, while the French have actively courted Chinese business, suggesting the European Union’s (EU’s) two largest economies are simply unwilling to tow Washington’s hard line.
But the Biden administration is unlikely to be deterred. In 2024, it will probably double down, stepping up its efforts to cajole Europe into a closer alignment with the United States on China. For the White House, playing host to NATO leaders in an election year, the Washington summit will offer an opportunity to tout both NATO’s shift to a more confrontational approach toward Beijing, as well as its growing ties to U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific, both of which are apt to play well domestically. It will also offer a major test of the Biden administration’s big bet on Europe in the Indo-Pacific. All signs warn of disappointment. The United States’ European allies may offer some tough words, but they are unlikely to offer much more.
Conventional wisdom: US outreach efforts toward Global South countries’ postures will lead to major changes vis-à-vis China and Russia
Aude Darnal
Research Associate
During the past two years, the Biden administration has expanded outreach efforts toward Global South countries in a bid to secure their alignment with Washington and counter China and Russia. This strategy was prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the worsening climate and debt crisis, as well as the wars between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas — all of which highlighted the gap between the United States’ position vis-à-vis the Global South and that of its counterparts.
These crises displayed, on the one hand, the United States’ weak relations with most Global South countries and, on the other, China’s — and to some extent, Russia’s — success in developing strong diplomatic, economic, and military ties with these states.
Washington reacted with various moves, such as the December 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, Biden’s call for an extension of the United Nations Security Council’s (UNSC) membership, and recognition of the Cook Islands and Niue “as sovereign and independent” states in September 2023.
However, it would be a mistake for U.S. policymakers to believe that these demonstrations of interest will result in a drastic change of posture by Global South countries. To be sure, some countries such as Pacific island states like Fiji, Nauru, and Tonga, have historical ties with Washington, which have often led them to align with the United States at the UN. But other major U.S. partners like India, Brazil, and South Africa, or smaller countries like Chile, Barbados, and Jamaica, have shown their commitment to a pragmatic foreign policy that aligns with their national priorities. As a result, these countries have resisted U.S. pressure to choose to partner with either the United States or its adversaries.
Moreover, beyond lip service, the United States has so far failed to prove its actual commitment to tangible change in global governance. The Biden administration has yet to unveil its proposal for UNSC membership reform — which is, in any case, unlikely to abolish or amend the veto power, a fundamental challenge to the UNSC’s legitimacy and credibility. There is also skepticism about Washington’s willingness to push for a tangible reform of the Bretton Woods institutions. In September 2023, U.S. Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh affirmed U.S. support for “an equiproportional increase in quotas — an increase that is allocated to all members in proportion to their existing shares” — in other words, no actual change in voting powers. Even in terms of bilateral agreements, the United States has still not taken any steps to remove the highly controversial Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) system from existing U.S. trade and investment agreements. According to trade and investment expert Alicia Nicholls, “some of the most consequential ISDS disputes have been between investors from Global North countries and Global South respondent states . . . [and the] largest ISDS compensation awards have been in the billions of dollars, exceeding the GDP of many small states.”
In other words, while many Global South countries demand concrete changes in global governance to move beyond colonial-era international rules and enact principles that truly foster inclusivity, prosperity, and security for all, the United States has not taken significant actions to share power and support consequential reform. Worse, Washington appears to cling to an outdated vision of the international system and seems unable to demonstrate strategic empathy toward its Global South counterparts. That leaves U.S. leaders working from a skewed perception of the United States’ standing in the world and a deep misunderstanding of what type of engagement Global South countries are interested in. Leaders of many of these states seek to advance their countries’ own interests, and they will partner with anyone that enables them to do so. Although the current great-power competition may lead them to juggle their partnerships with China, Russia, and the United States, the past two years have demonstrated how, nonetheless, they will continue to pursue pragmatic cooperation with all sides.
Conventional (but untested) wisdom: Europe will increase defense spending if the US reduces its support for NATO
Emma Ashford
Senior Fellow
A central point of contention in the literature on U.S. alliances is the question of whether U.S. contributions to the defense of America’s allies encourage free-riding — that is to say, discourage allies from actually spending on their own defense — or not.
Unusual for a theoretical debate, this question bleeds over into public, high-stakes policy discussions about the U.S. role in European security. Does the U.S. military presence in Europe and its role in NATO discourage European states from investing in their militaries and defensive capabilities? Or does the U.S. presence help to facilitate European cooperation on defense, improve interoperability, and encourage future investment?
Answering this question is harder than one might think. A few minor cases of American pullback can be found, such as during the 1970s, when effective messaging around burden shifting from the Nixon administration, followed by America’s post-Vietnam hangover, led European states to briefly increase defense spending. But in general, the only time when the United States significantly retrenched from Europe was in the mid-1990s, when the collapse of the Soviet Union also removed the only significant military threat to European states; unsurprisingly, military spending fell across the board during that decade.
And even recent periods of acute threat to European allies — including the 2014 and 2022 Russian invasions of Ukraine — do not provide a good test of this assumption because the United States maintained or increased its commitments to European defense in each case. In short, we have not been able to adequately assess this assumption because there is too little variation in the independent variable: the United States has never sufficiently pulled back to test it.
In 2024, however, two specific scenarios suggest that this proposition might finally be tested. The first would test a weaker form of this assumption: that European states will step up their financial support and their contributions of arms for the war in Ukraine if the U.S. Congress is unable to come to an agreement on further funding for Kyiv. Early indications might suggest either increased support (e.g., recent EU moves to increase funding to Kyiv) or a failure to do so (e.g., complications in those negotiations along with increased skepticism in Germany and elsewhere about the course of the war). There is also a potential confounding factor: European states are so dependent on U.S. technology that in some areas they simply cannot supply arms to Ukraine on their own.
The second — and more significant — test of this proposition would occur if a second Trump administration were to become more likely. Throughout his first presidency, Trump expressed repeated skepticism about the value of U.S. alliances in Europe; leaks suggest that he will pursue a significant reduction of the U.S. role in NATO if re-elected. Unlike the war in Ukraine, a potential American retrenchment from NATO might well see European states step up their direct contributions to defense, both financially and in concrete military capabilities.
In both scenarios, however, policymakers need to be careful not to reject the idea that retrenchment can promote burden-sharing simply because European states’ responses are not overwhelming or consistent. Observers of European defense politics have long noted that a central obstacle to European defense investments is the differing levels of threat that EU states face, depending on their geographical proximity to the borders of the bloc. Even in the absence of significant U.S. military commitments to Europe, states like Germany might not perceive enough of a threat from Russia to significantly alter their spending patterns. But even if the EU — or some other cross-European bloc — is not able to come together, the assumption that U.S. retrenchment would increase European provision of defense would still be proven true if the countries closest to the threat — particularly those geographically closest to Russia — began to dramatically increase their defense spending or look for other ways to guarantee their security.
Conventional wisdom: The United States has a coherent strategy based on sustaining primacy
Robert A. Manning
Distinguished Fellow
As the Biden administration enters 2024, the predicament U.S. foreign policy is a challenge to core assumptions of U.S. primacy: that the United States is, as Biden said last October, the “indispensable nation”; and that, in a fragmenting world order and an increasingly multipolar world, pursuing a coherent grand strategy is possible.
The Biden administration finds itself deeply, yet mostly vicariously, entangled in two open-ended wars — in Ukraine and the Israel-Palestinian conflict — whose resolutions are elusive and where the United States appears unwilling or unable to shape preferred outcomes. In both cases, support for these policies from a divided Congress and a war-weary U.S. public appears increasingly problematic and may impact the upcoming presidential elections.
In the Ukraine case, the United States has provided more than $75 billion in economic and military aid in addition to increased U.S. troop deployments in Europe. With regard to Israel, the United States has increased military aid on top of the mandated $3.8 billion in existing aid. A risk of escalation to direct U.S. combat with Russia in Ukraine remains. In the Middle East, U.S. forces have already engaged with Iran-backed proxy forces — the Houthis in Yemen — and Iran-backed militia in Iraq and Syria.
Yet, in the Biden administration’s October 2022 National Security Strategy, Biden said the world is “at an inflection point in history,” and we are “in the midst of a strategic competition to shape the future of the international order.” But the strategy identifies Asia as the strategic priority, focusing on China as, “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.” No question, from chip wars to near US-China military misses in the South China Sea, competition with China persists.
The premise that the United States alone must play “Globocop,” driven by the mission of American exceptionalism, means any perceived challenge to U.S. values or expansive interests — vital or not — tends to pull in unanticipated directions, regardless of declared strategic priorities. President Biden seems undeterred by the proliferating wars and mounting U.S. commitments. At an October 2023 campaign event, he again called the United States “the essential nation,” arguing, “…we’re the United States of America, for God’s sake.  And there’s nothing — nothing beyond our capacity — nothing . . .”
But a $1.7 trillion FY23 budget deficit and a $34 trillion national debt should remind U.S. policymakers that American resources are not unlimited. Choices to intervene in one situation may constrain options for a higher-priority problem elsewhere. The war in Ukraine, for example, has brought into stark relief the inadequacies — if not a hollowing out — of the U.S. defense industrial base. Shortages have limited the amount of ammunition and air defense technologies that the United States is able to provide Ukraine.
Resolutions to either the conflict in Ukraine or the situation in the Middle East do not appear to be on the horizon; both are likely to fester. Although Biden has declared in his National Security Strategy that the United States should prioritize Asia, U.S. commitments of resources are increasingly dispersed in other areas. Ukraine is devolving into a war of attrition and stalemate. If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority. This failure to grasp the limits of American power, both in terms of resources and agency to achieve goals, continues to plague U.S. foreign policy.
As 2024 dawns, a record number of armed conflicts are underway. The ability of the United States to remain focused on three regions at once will be tested following the presidential elections in Taiwan on January 13. China is almost certain to react harshly if Lai Ching-te, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidate consistently leading in the polls, is elected. If Beijing overreacts and steps up coercive air and naval incursions around Taiwan, heightened US-China tensions and possible confrontation could ensue. 
The U.S. overstretch in reacting to disparate and disconnected events renders problem-solving more difficult and tempts adversaries. Prioritization is essential. A deeply polarized Congress, growing major-power competition, and troubling U.S. budget deficits illuminate real-world constraints and menacing risks. In one of his last public comments, the late Henry Kissinger underscored the risks: “We are at the edge of war with Russia and China on issues which we partly created, without any concept of how this is going to end or what it’s supposed to lead to.”
Grand strategy, particularly at a turbulent time of historic change, is problematic, more so when shaped by exceptionalist ideology and outmoded assumptions. A focus on priorities and understanding the limits of power is the beginning of wisdom.

For more than 50 years, and especially since the Iranian revolution of 1979, U.S. policies and initiatives in the Middle East rested on a complex network of relations with four diverse regional pillars: Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, and Egypt. At one time or another the United States worked with one or more of these states to contain the perennial fires ravaging the region (even when these same states ignited the fires in the first place, whether Saudi Arabia in Yemen, Israel in Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories, or Turkey in Iraq and Syria).

In his popular 1998 book, The Dream Palace of the Arabs, the late scholar Fouad Ajami offered a critique of 20th-century Arab nationalists and intellectuals for having built what Ajami saw as a fictional sense of their own accomplishments, which he claimed in turn had promoted a chauvinistic and conspiratorial worldview. “In an Arab political history littered with thwarted dreams, little honor would be extended to pragmatists who knew the limits of what could and could not be done,” he wrote. “The political culture of nationalism reserved its approval for those who led ruinous campaigns in pursuit of impossible quests.”

Theories of international relations (IR) usually deal with repetitive events in world affairs, as these theories attempt to uncover law-like regularities by isolating a phenomenon (the dependent variable) and then examining which independent variable(s) leads to that phenomenon in a cause-effect relationship (if X then Y). However, theories of IR rarely address change or attempt to develop a theory that can explain change, simply because change is unpredictable. This article however attempts to explain when a change in US foreign policy in the Middle East occurs and what factor(s) lead to a change in US policy. The Middle East has its own unique culture and regional dynamics of intra- and inter-state relationships. An elected U.S. President typically has very little knowledge of this culture and dynamics. Therefore, the assumption of this article is that a U.S. president must rely on an existing problem-solving model that would guide his foreign policy toward the region. The question is how a problem-solving model is consolidated and what causes a shift from one model to another.
From Crisis to Change
This article utilizes two sets of theories: social constructivism in order to explain continuity in existing policy, and the eruption of a major crisis to explain change. The theory of social constructivism claims that reality is a reflection of ideas, where a consensus around a set of ideas guides the behavior of statesmen and their decision-making process and prompts policymakers to construct reality based on these ideas (Berger & Luckmann, 2016; Checkel, 2004; Wendt, 1999). The article claims that a set of ideas constitutes a problem-solving model that guides US foreign policy during a historical bloc. During each historical bloc, there was only one set of ideas or problem-solving model that dominated and guided the US foreign policy towards the region. As long as the set of ideas was not proven to be wrong, such a set ties the minds of policymakers, where they cannot think outside of it. In this sense, ideas that run counter to the mindset are rejected. Thus, reality becomes a reflection of intersubjectivity among policymakers.
The article argues that the eruption of a major crisis in the Middle East usually proves though that the existing problem-solving model is no longer valid, thus triggering a change in US foreign policy towards the region, which leads to both the bankruptcy of the existing set of ideas (model) that has had hitherto guided the policy and bestowed on its legitimacy and common sense, and the consolidation of a new set of ideas that would seek to address the roots of the crisis (Halabi, 2009). A major crisis may involve a single event that occurs abruptly in a short period of time, such as the 1973-74 Energy Crisis, the Iranian revolution in 1978 or the events of September 11, or it may involve a protracted event, such as the civil war in Iraq or Afghanistan, which taught the hegemon in the hard way that not only the goals that were originally set are unattainable, but also the plan that was implemented does not match the circumstances on the ground (Hermann, 1990). A major crisis leads to the bankruptcy of the existing model and gives rise to a new set of ideas that would address the causes of the crisis and provide new guidelines for dealing with the post-crisis period (Gustavsson, 1999).
According to Hermann, change could be leader-driven, bureaucracy advocacy, domestic restructuring or an external shock (Hermann, 1990: 3). This article claims that despite change in the Administration, one can notice continuity in US foreign policy, while change was merely triggered by external shocks that took place in the Middle East. These external shocks include: the Yom-Kippur War that resulted in the Oil Embargo, the Iranian Revolution, and 9/11 events and the failure of US Intervention in realizing its initial goals in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Hermann also points out four levels of change: Adjustment Changes, Program Changes, Problem/Goal Changes, and International Orientation Changes (p. 5). This study claims that after both the Yom-Kippur and Iranian Revolution, Program Changes were figured out, where the US changed its policy course, while the goals remained constant: stabilizing the Middle East, without promoting democratization.
Stabilizing the Middle East though is predicated on the fact that some countries in the region are indispensable for the US as well as the whole world: Saudi Arabia (the jewel in the crown), UAE, Qatar and Kuwait. All of these countries are major exporters of either oil or natural gas. There are two questions that remain unanswered: First, whether Jordan and Egypt should also be included in this list; and second, what would the US do if the regime in any of these countries is in danger of being overthrown by an Islamist movement, especially since the US has no plan B for what to do next. Would the US intervene at all, and would it try to restore the same old regime against the will of the people? With regard to Jordan, it should be emphasized that fundamentalist sentiments in the Hashemite Monarchy are also influenced by tensions within Israel over the holy sites and the Temple Mount in particular. Tensions within Israel over the Temple Mount intensify pressure on the monarchy to retaliate, as Jordan is the custodian of this third holiest site for Muslims.
The 1973-74 Energy Crisis: Stabilizing the Middle East through peace process
The Yom-Kippur War instigated 1973-74 energy crisis, which directly led to the exigency of instigating a peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Prior to the crisis, however, the U.S. felt no pressure to initiate such a process based on the prevailed assumption at the time that Israel’s Arab neighbors were relatively too weak and deterred by Israel’s military might, while their demands for full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories as a precondition for ending belligerency were unacceptable on Israel, hence unrealistic from an American point of view (Quandt, 2010: 64-65; Kissinger, 1979: 559). The Yom Kippur War proved to the Nixon/Ford Administrations that the reality on the ground was different, as Arab states were unhappy with the status quo and thus undeterred. The outbreak of the October War and the ensuing energy crisis resulting from the Arab Oil Embargo led to a sharp rise in the price of the barrel of oil and stagflation (i.e. inflation and rising unemployment) (Quandt, 2010: 98-100). Thus, it was not only the war itself that compelled the U.S. to change its political course, but more importantly, the energy crisis that was felt by every American household and the accumulation of Petro-dollars in the hands of a few traditional monarchies (Kissinger, 1999: 664). The energy crisis proved to the US that the pre-1973 status quo was abnormal and that stability in the Middle East cannot be maintained through military might and deterrence, but through a peace process.
The Iranian Revolution: The advent of neo-orientalism and neo-liberal reforms
The 1979 Iranian Revolution gave birth to the ideas of Neo-Orientalism, which refuted the old Orientalist assumptions that Muslim people passively and blindly obey their leaders, whether the leader happens to be a descendant of a monarchical family, a former military officer, or a secular or religious figure (Al-Kassimi, 2021; Hazran, 2012: 116; Kedourie, 1994: 7). This crisis also had domestic political repercussions in the U.S. and outrage in the American public opinion following the occupation of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, the ensuing American hostage crisis, and the sharp rise in the price of oil barrel, which reached about $41 in 1981 at current prices (Houghton, 2001: 5; Sick, 1985: 31). Prior to the Iranian revolution, the set of ideas informed US policymakers that the domestic arena withing the Arab/Islamic states is stable due to the assumption that Arabs/Muslims always defer to their leader and that civil society is too weak in these countries, thus the US should mainly intervene in the regional balance of power in order to protect its allies, but without meddling in their internal affairs. After the revolution, neo-Orientalists claimed that Muslims are always eager to establish an Islamic regime that reflects their religious beliefs and values (Al-Kassimi, 2021; Kumar, 2012), and that they despise a secular authoritarian leader who adopts and implements Western-oriented policies, especially in domestic affairs, as the Shah of Iran attempted to do through the White Revolution during the 1960s. Thus, neo-Orientalists claim a direct link between the White Revolution and the Islamist one, following which, the US began embracing the ideas of stabilizing Middle Eastern countries through the ideas of neoliberal reforms.
The US extrapolated that reforming the economies of Arab/Muslim states and transforming them into market-oriented economies would create an efficient allocation of resources, generate more jobs, attract foreign direct investments, and create more wealth, which would trickle down to the lower classes and would dissuade ordinary Muslims from joining or supporting Islamist movements (Halabi, 2009: 88). However, the U.S. was reluctant of promoting democratic reforms, fearing that free and fair elections would bring anti-American, Islamist groups to power. Thus, neo-Orientalism continued to adhere to the Orientalist ideas that the Islamic world is neither amenable to embrace modernization nor democratization, where the assumption is that Muslim societies are anti-Western and anti-democratic in nature (Al-Kassimi, 2021); however, at the individual level, neo-Orientalists maintain that Muslims aspire to realize a decent standard of living and a normal life under capitalism, where members of the middle- and working-class would be less inclined as individuals to support Islamist movements against an incumbent leader (Sadowski, 1993; Samiei, 2010: 1148). Neo-orientalists contend that poverty, disparity in the distribution of wealth and corrupt regimes induce the lower classes to lend their support to Islamist movements, where in their view, free-market reforms would boost the living standards of the lower classes and curtail their support to the Islamists (Waterbury, 1998: 160).
Another set of ideas that the Iranian Revolution undermined was the US participation in the regional balance of power. Till 1979, the consensus in the US was that the Arab/Islamic states were able to take care of subversive groups within their border, whereas the presumption was that the US should merely take care of their external threats, by participating in the regional balance of power. Thus, there was hitherto a division of labor between the US and its regional allies, where the former was responsible for the external security of the latter and the regional stability by participating in the regional balance of power, while US allies focused on their internal security. The Iranian revolution shattered this set of ideas and induced the US to start consolidating new ideas that would maintain internal stability in addition to the regional one.
September 11, 2001: democratization strategy and its spillover effect
The events of 9/11, 2001, likewise, refuted in the eyes of U.S. policymakers the neo-Orientalist notions that Muslims constitute essentialist, immutable societies that reject Western freedom and are not amenable to embrace modernization and democratization (Halabi, 2009: 103). The Bush Jr. administration solidified counter-Orientalist mindset by assuming that there was a connection between the lack of democratization in the Middle East and global terrorism, even though the perpetrators of this mega-terrorist attack came from upper middle-class families and their goal was to force the U.S. to withdraw from Saudi Arabia, in particular. The administration came out with a roughly two-step grand strategy for the Middle East. First is U.S. military intervention to remove two authoritarian regimes from power: the Taliban and Saddam regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively, and eliminate the insurgent groups in those two countries. And second is that the fight against jihadist terrorist insurgent movements, such as Al-Qaeda, should be accompanied with democratization. The administration hoped that the establishment of two democracies in Afghanistan and Iraq would constitute Islamic democratic prototypes and would inevitably allow the democratization process to spillover into other countries in the region (McKinley, 2021). However, after the failure of the two missions of nation building in both Iraq and Afghanistan, including the failure to achieve either of the two steps of the grand strategy, the Biden Administration has finally decided to abandon the counter-Orientalist ideas (Rasmussen, 2021). The question is whether this administration would reluctantly re-embrace the neo-Orientalist ones? Given the failure of democratization in both Afghanistan and Iraq, Neo-Orientalism has inevitably become the administration’s default strategy and the standard set of ideas. Yet, this article claims that there is still another option called semi-democratization, as explained below.
Neo-Orientalism
The main difference between Orientalism and neo-Orientalism is that the former perceives societies in the Arab-Islamic world as passive and ones that always defer to their leader. This model was shattered following the Iranian Revolution, which led to the rise of the Neo-Orientalist model. Neo-Orientalism perceives these societies as powerful enough and always aspire to establish an Islamist regime that blocks the penetration of Western values into the Arab-Islamic societies. Therefore, the model that was developed and is succinctly summarized in the words of Robert Pelletreau, former Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs:
certain manifestations of the Islamic revival are intensely anti-Western and aim not only at elimination of Western influences but at resisting any form of cooperation with the West or modernizing evolution at home. Such tendencies are clearly hostile to U.S. interests…. Because we believe that opening political systems to participation offers the only proven means to preserve civil liberties and render governments accountable to the will of the people, we’re opposed to those who, regardless of religion, oppress minorities, preach intolerance, practice terrorism or violate human rights. We’re suspicious of those who would use the democratic process to come to power only to destroy that process in order to retain power and political dominance (Pelletreau Jr, Pipes & Esposito, 1994: 3).
In a different interview, Pelletreau outlines the strategy of stabilizing the Middle East and realizing US interests:
We support free-market economic reforms in the region and are encouraged by progress in countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, and Israel. Egypt and Algeria have launched important market-oriented initiatives. We also encourage movement toward more participatory government and respect for human rights and the rule of law. We encourage practical measures to foster greater political freedom and openness. We do this not because we are trying to impose Western models of society and government on the Middle East, but because experience has taught us that governments must be seen as responding to the aspirations of their people and acting for the benefit of their people in order to ensure long-term allegiance and stability (Pelletreau, 1996).
In short, according to Pelletreau, the U.S. should encourage free market economies, and limited political openness that on the one hand would encourage more political freedom and accountability, but one that cannot be used by Islamists to come to power.
Analyzing the causes of the failure of nation-building in general and the democratization of Iraq and Afghanistan in particular is beyond the scope of this article. What is certain is that Iraq has been mired in a sectarian civil war between Sunnis and Shiites, a predictable outcome of both the Orientalist and Neo-Orientalist models, while the American (read: Western) intervention in Iraq not only failed to foresee the rise of the insurgent Islamist groups, let alone eliminate them, but inadvertently led to the rise of Al-Qaeda affiliated groups that culminated in the consolidation of Islamic State reign over parts of Syria and Iraq (Stansfield, 2014). These movements perceived the U.S. intervention as a crusade that should be defeated at all costs. The Shia-led government in Baghdad was perceived as illegitimate by Sunnis, who sought to overthrow it, while state institutions remained weak and unable to impose order and stability. In Afghanistan, state institutions remained weak while the democratic process failed to consolidate a legitimate regime and strong state institutions. While Islam, according to Orientalism and neo-Orientalism hindered democratization, tribalism and centrifugal forces in traditional societies like Afghanistan, which never developed loyalty to a central, remote government, hindered the consolidation of strong state institutions (Eikenberry, 2013; Berman, 2010). Thus, while both Orientalism and neo-Orientalism concur that Islam can facilitate the rise of a strong central Islamic (khalifate) regime, both models agree that Islamic and tribal forces are hostile to a strong, central democratic state.
Following the U.S.’s abandonment of Afghanistan and withdrawal of its main forces from Iraq, however, the U.S. has no intention of leaving the Middle East, simply because the region remains the major oil exporter and abandoning the Middle East would negatively impinge on the global economy and Israel’s security. But while the US has no interest or desire to support democratization in the region, it is also not enthusiastic about supporting authoritarian or traditionally monarchical regimes that tarnish its reputation in the eyes of the local population. Thus, the US finds itself in a catch-22 state. Supporting non-democratic regimes would diminish its credit in the eyes of the local population, while supporting democratization is doomed to fail and would bring more chaos than stability, not to mention bringing Islamist parties to power. Given that the US has ditched the democratization and nation-building options, it was reluctantly left with the default option of continuing to support its traditional allies in the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, etc. These regimes are indispensable to the US. However, with the reintroduction of neo-Orientalism, the US has no plan B on what to do if any of these regimes are toppled, as the US has no plan to interfere in the internal affairs of these states, knowing that intervention for the sake of nation-building would be futile.
What is peculiar about the models guiding U.S. foreign policy in the post-Afghan and post-Iraq interventionist era is that the U.S. has run out of new ideas and is falling back on an old model that has some flaws. One of the main criticisms of neo-Orientalism is that the model perceives the culture of the Islamic world as immutable, static, monolithic, homogeneous, and uniform. As such, the model does not mandate the promotion of democratization, but also sees the promotion of democratization as a major threat to U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, because democratization, according to its proponents, would bring anti-Western Islamist parties to power. First, the model envisions cultivating relations with and strengthening the position of pragmatic, pro-Western authoritarian leaders, such as the monarchs in Jordan, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia or President Al-Sisi of Egypt. Second, the model assumes that the Muslim societies in these states are immutable cultures that are not different in their mindset from the pre-revolution Iranians. The model ignores the impact of globalization on the young generation. In this regard, there are many Muslim citizens who genuinely aspire to live under a democratic regime and to put an end to the lack of transparency and corruption of their authoritarian regime. These citizens would perceive the U.S. foreign policy as one that strangles their aspirations and they would therefore develop anti-American attitude and may even be pushed into the ranks of the Islamist camp, which is considered the strongest stream in any Islamic society.
Third, neo-Orientalism advocates the promotion of capitalism, free trade and free market reforms that seek to maximize economic growth. However, these reforms would widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Furthermore, from a Gramscian perspective, capitalism in Western societies leads to stability that is underpinned by the consolidation of a strong civil society. Yet, civil society has remained weak in Middle East societies, and civil society organizations have been suppressed and consequently weakened by the local regimes. Hence, the combination of the widening of the gap between the lower classes and the rich and the weakness of civil society would also lead the working class to overthrow the regime. In short, authoritarianism drives the working class into the hands of the Islamist movements that would exploit the demands of the working class for reforms, as happened in Tunisia and Egypt after the outbreak of the uprising in these two countries in early 2011. The uprising was instigated by the young generation and was later led by the Islamist Ennahda and the Muslim Brotherhood movements in Tunisia and Egypt, respectively.
Semi-democratization
As the leader of the free world, the US cannot simply resort to brute force in order to support non-democratic, traditional regimes in the Middle East, simply because the alternative to these regimes is a fundamentalist, anti-Western one. By the same token, the US cannot afford not to intervene in the internal affairs of the above-mentioned states, simply because international law forbids intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign states, given the assumption that the type of regime should be determined by domestic forces. Any abrupt revolutionary transition nonetheless from the existing pro-Western regimes into a fundamentalist anti-Western one in any of these countries would have major repercussions to world economies. Therefore, the US not only would feel obliged to intervene, but also the US should put in place pre-emptive measures that would allow it to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to fight against fundamentalist, Islamist forces that threaten to seize power.
Given the current conditions of Middle East politics, the US should encourage through peaceful means promoting semi-democratization, i.e. free parliamentary elections, yet a controlled liberalization process, similar to the system that already exists in monarchies, such as Jordan, Kuwait and Morocco (Ryan, 1998; Robinson, 1997). Semi-democratization would allow representation of society, yet would keep the authority to dismiss the parliament in the hands of the monarch or the president (in the case of Egypt) (Ryan, 1998; Robinson, 1997). The US can promote semi-democratization through diplomatic pressure, persuasion of the current regimes that it is in their interest to embrace such measures, or through financial incentives; thus, the US should resort to means that are short of the use of force. A government that would be formed would need to gain confidence from the parliament and would run the daily affairs of the country; yet foreign and security affairs would remain in the hands of the monarch/president. While promoting semi-democratization, the US should also avoid some pitfalls and learn from the experience of other semi-democracies in the region.
First, the US should avoid promoting regional, district elections, where the winner gets all, and instead, it should promote proportional elections with a threshold that would be set at around 5 percent. Given that the Islamist movements are considered as the most powerful political forces in any Islamic state, district elections foster the principle of winner-gets-all, would magnify Islamists’ political power by leading to overrepresentation of such movements and underrepresentation of other non-religious movements. Therefore, proportional elections would allow less powerful secular movements to enter the parliament and constitute a counterbalance to the Islamists. A 5-percent threshold would at the same time prevent fragmentation in the parliament as it would block small movements from being elected. By forming a government that would gain confidence from the parliament, the government would enjoy more legitimacy and would deflect criticism from the monarch/president to the government in case something goes wrong.
Second, these semi-democracies should have a strong constitution that on the one hand protects the status of a monarch, yet limits his authority to dismiss parliament to certain outstanding circumstances. Further, the constitution should avoid referring to Shariah laws as the main or sole source of the constitution. Further, the constitution should put a limit on state expenditures and avoid the Kuwaiti democratic model of a nation of bureaucrats, where state employees are turned into an interest group, who hijack the parliament by electing MPs that serve their own interests. State employees have become the most powerful group in Kuwait, who put their interests ahead of the nation’s interests (Herb, 2009).
In contrast, other monarchies, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar are ruling their people without a parliament. A parliament constitutes a major link between society and the ruling monarchy, where its absence points to a disconnection between the two. It is possible that employing external pressure by the US on these monarchic regimes to adopt semi-democratization could be met with stiff objection by these regimes, thus severing US relations with them. Yet, the US should see the bigger picture that the persistence of the status quo may lead to an abrupt revolution similar to the 1979 Iranian revolution, where semi-democratization may stabilize these regimes for many years to come. Further, elected parliament allows better transparency in the operation of the government and provides hope for implementing reforms, based on the will of the people. Given that these states are highly vital for the operation of the world economy, the world has an interest in maintaining political stability in these states. Under these circumstances, the US should put pressure on these states to embark on a process of regulated-liberalization and controlled-democratization process.
Conclusion
This article explains the way a major crisis in the Middle East highlights the deficiency in an existing set of ideas or problem-solving model and allows the rise of a new set of ideas that aims to address the causes that led to the crisis and to stabilize the region in the post-crisis period. These crises include: the 1973/74 Yom-Kippur War and Oil Embargo, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the 9/11 Events, and the failure of US nation-building mission in both Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Following 9/11, there were both Program and Problem/Goal Changes in US policy towards the Middle East. The US embraced the use of force in order to promote democratization in the Middle East. After the bankruptcy of US policy in Iraq and Afghanistan, though there was again a change in both Program and Problem/Goal: ending US military intervention in the project of nation-building/democratization and shifting towards supporting local authoritarian regimes. Yet, the fact that the US failed to promote democratization through the use of force should not deter the US from promoting semi-democratization through cooperation and persuasion of the existing regimes. The policy of military intervention contained its own seeds of destruction: the use of force portrayed the US as an imperialistic power in the eyes of Muslims, and the policy lacked popularity among the American people. Promoting semi-democratization though would be pursued in coordination with the existing regimes and would gain the support of both the American people and the people of the targeted states.
Under this reality, it seems that the Biden Administration is relapsing back to the old neo-Orientalist set of ideas. Yet, in order to avoid alienating the masses, especially following the Arab Spring, the Biden Administration can lend its support to pro-American authoritarian regimes, and at the same time, encourage these regimes to support semi-democratic institutions combined with market-oriented economies, where Arabs/Muslims would slowly learn how to run these institutions and gradually integrate into the world economy.

“The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,” asserted US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on 29 September.
“Now challenges remain, but the amount of time that I have to spend on crisis and conflict in the Middle East today compared to any of my predecessors going back to 9/11 is significantly reduced.”
Sullivan’s comments have aged horribly. Just eight days later, Hamas waged its incursion into southern Israel, triggering a brutal Israeli campaign of bombardment of Gaza. The fighting since 7 October has thus far killed more than 8,000 Palestinians in Gaza and 1,400 Israelis.
The violence has spilled into Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, and Egypt. At this point, the escalating crisis risks spreading to other parts of the Middle East, possibly entailing direct US and Iranian involvement.
Now a full-scale Israeli ground invasion of Gaza looms and Palestinians are concerned about a ‘Nakba 2.0’. Considering rhetoric coming from high-ranking Israeli officials and Tel Aviv’s plans and actions this month, such concerns are entirely valid. As usual, the US has not put any real pressure on Israel to change its destructive and destabilising behaviour.
""Looking ahead, it will be increasingly difficult to imagine the Global South taking the Biden administration's rhetoric about human rights with anything more than a grain of salt. The hypocrisy from America is just too great""
The timing of this crisis is also particularly horrible given that President Joe Biden, who is seeking re-election next year, doesn’t want to appear to be giving Israel anything less than ironclad support.
As the world witnesses Israel’s war crimes in Gaza carried out with Washington’s blessing, the US’s capacity to be taken seriously when criticising Russia’s rogue behaviour in Ukraine has been severely, and most likely permanently, damaged.
Looking ahead, it will be increasingly difficult to imagine the Global South taking the Biden administration’s rhetoric about human rights with anything more than a grain of salt. The hypocrisy from America is just too great.
“It’s been an unseemly spectacle to see Washington and its European allies support Israel as it cuts off aid, water, and food to besieged civilians in Gaza,” Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International and a Middle East analyst, told The New Arab.
“It is exactly what these same nations denounced the Syrian regime for doing in Homs, Ghouta, Aleppo, and other places. They didn’t mince words when Russia stepped up to support Damascus and vetoed UN condemnations. Now when their own ally blocked aid and food in the same way, they couldn’t muster even mild criticism,” added Lund.

A foreign policy blunder
It is increasingly difficult to deny the major failures of Washington’s foreign policy in the Middle East. While continuing many aspects of the Trump administration’s approach to the region, the Biden administration has made expanding the scope of the Abraham Accords central to its agenda in the Arab world.
The White House naively believed it could bring Libya into a normalisation deal with Israel, which backfired disastrously.
The Biden administration has also invested massive amounts of diplomatic energy into trying to pull Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords - something that no expert can imagine happening any time soon given ongoing developments in Israel and Palestine.
“The recent events have punched a giant hole into the paper-thin superficial Biden administration policy on the Middle East, which has deluded itself into believing that establishing close ties with apartheid Israel and dictatorships in the Middle East is some kind of recipe for stability,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the Executive Director of Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), told TNA.

What is being painfully demonstrated is that lasting peace and security for Israel will not come from diplomatic deals with Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which were arguably never confrontational toward Israel.
It can only come from a lasting solution to the unresolved Palestinian question. Attempts to bury the Palestinian issue based on the assumption that the Palestinian cause stopped mattering to the Arab world have proven extremely misguided.
“As with Israel, one of the assumptions of US foreign policy in the Middle East has been annihilated in the past three weeks: that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be contained, and that the region could move on,” said Dr Thomas Juneau, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, in an interview with TNA.
“This was predictably an unsustainable assumption, but it was one of the premises of American foreign policy under Biden (and Trump) nevertheless. There are still some positive elements to the Abraham Accords - the stabilisation of relations among Israel and key Arab states - but to be sustainable, it needs to be accompanied by genuine, not fictitious, progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front,” added Dr Juneau.
""Recent events have punched a giant hole into the paper-thin superficial Biden administration policy on the Middle East""
Arab backlash
Anger at the US is growing in the Middle East. Large scale protests in capitals from Amman to Manama, Sana‘a to Baghdad, and Rabat to Beirut speak to the widespread support that the Palestinians are receiving across the Arab world.
In response to public opinion in their own countries, Arab leaders and policymakers have had no choice but to strongly condemn Israel and express support for the Palestinian cause.
Each Arab government faces slightly different circumstances given differences in these countries’ relationships with the US and Israel. Yet, the dynamics across the region are putting pressure on all of them to speak up in defence of the Palestinians and, at least in the case of most Arab states, refrain from directly criticising Hamas.
It was notable that Saudi Arabia, which only several weeks ago was flirting with normalisation with Israel, referred to Israelis as “occupation forces” in its response to Hamas’ Operation al-Aqsa Flood on 7 October.

Despite the Abraham Accords, the UAE, in its capacity as the only Arab state currently on the UN Security Council, has been highly critical of Israel and condemned various aspects of its response to Hamas’ surprise attack. As the humanitarian suffering in Gaza worsens, it’s safe to assume that such criticisms from the UAE will increase.
However, this appears to be about safeguarding regimes from internal legitimacy crises rather than a true commitment to the well-being of the Palestinians.
“It is heartening to see that kind of a pretty united Arab response, but I think it probably has more to do with their concerns about popular unrest in their own countries and wanting to temper that than any pure or genuine concern for Palestinians,” Whitson said.
“All Arab states want Washington to be more mindful of Palestinian and Arab interests, but they’re not equally vocal about it,” explained Lund.
The failure of Biden's Middle East foreign policy threatens to undermine US standing in the region as well as the US president's position in the upcoming election. [Getty]
“Governments like that in Syria, which is already hostile to the United States, delight in the opportunity to denounce Washington’s support for Israeli policies,"" Lund added.
""Some Arab states, including US-allied nations in the Gulf and states that normalised their ties with Israel, mainly seem to be turning up the volume on Palestine for domestic reasons, or to avoid exposing themselves to criticism from rivals.”
Lund explained how many of these Washington-friendly Arab states are not comfortable confronting the Biden administration about their problems with blind support for Israel.
“You see them criticising Israel in harsher terms than on a normal day, but they haven’t said much about the US support that enables Israel’s actions,” noted Lund.
“On the other hand, I think most realise that if this situation is going to be de-escalated somehow in the future, it’ll have to be the United States that leads the way.”

A time to reassess US foreign policy
When it comes to the White House’s approach to the Middle East, the Biden administration would be wise to change course and ask some tough questions about how we arrived here. But this is unlikely for two principal reasons, said Whitson.
First, Team Biden, “continues to calculate based on short-term interests - namely the upcoming elections - and continues to believe that [Biden’s] victory in the polls is tied to demonstrating extreme support for Israel,” which Whitson sees as a “growing miscalculation”.
Second, the “deeply held personal biases of the Biden administration, of people in the State Department who are not approaching this conflict with clear eyes, with independent thinking, with thinking that prioritises the interests of the American people,” explained Whitson.
“Rather, as Secretary Blinken amply demonstrated during his visit to Israel, their approach to Israel is driven by their own personal, familial feelings of affinity for Israel.”

The shocking Hamas assault on Israel has precipitated a beginning and an end for the Middle East. What has begun, almost inexorably, is the next war—one that will be bloody, costly, and agonizingly unpredictable in its course and outcome. What has ended, for anyone who cares to admit it, is the illusion that the United States can extricate itself from a region that has dominated the American national security agenda for the past half century.

18,Joe Biden's Imaginary Middle East Policy,https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/joe-bidens-imaginary-middle-east-policy/,20238-20238,"Joe Biden’s Imaginary Middle East Policy
Aug 24, 2023 Charles W. Dunne
Over his more than four decades of service as a US senator, vice president, and now as president, Joe Biden has cultivated an image of the consummate foreign policy realist. A card-carrying member of the Washington foreign policy “blob,” Biden is the very model of a liberal internationalist—standing up for a rules-based order, multilateralism, strong alliances, and a robust defense of democracy. But when it comes to the Middle East, Biden’s vaunted realism seems to have deserted him. In his approach to the region, Biden has leaned heavily on wishful thinking, outdated diplomatic tropes, empty assertions, and meaningless promises. Biden’s Middle East policy is, in a word, imaginary.
This is not to say that the Biden administration has no ideas on policy options. For one thing, it is working hard to cement a Saudi Arabia-Israel deal on normalization, which could be transformative, if it happens. But the intellectual gravamen of the administration’s approach seems to be based on the rickety structure of older policy, the basis of which has altered beyond recognition in the last 20 years.
Is There a Two-State Solution?
Nowhere is this more obvious than the president’s approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Biden continues to tout the “two-state solution,” a staple of American Middle East peace policy for decades, as the key to a final settlement for the decades-old conflict. There are two problems with this, however. First, the administration has done nothing on the diplomatic front to advance this concept, and has no apparent intention of doing so. Biden himself acknowledged this in 2022 after meeting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, saying publicly that “the ground is not ripe at this moment to restart negotiations,” while also reaffirming his preference for a two-state solution based on Clinton-era formulations regarding borders and the status of Jerusalem.
Biden continues to tout the “two-state solution,” a staple of American Middle East peace policy for decades, as the key to a final settlement for the decades-old conflict.
In so doing, Biden failed to acknowledge the second, more serious problem: the fact that the two-state solution itself is most likely dead, the victim of an avalanche of new Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and the growing political dysfunction and intransigence in both Israel and Palestine. The current reality on the ground is a de facto one-state solution, with Israel ruling most of historic Palestine and maintaining control over Palestinians by means of a repressive military regime in the West Bank and occasional punitive forays into the Gaza Strip. Whether this is viable as a long-term policy is debatable. So too is the question of how Israel can remain a democracy, and thus retain its bonds of sympathy and principle with the United States as the protocols and politics of occupation championed by the settler movement increasingly dominate and define Israeli governance of the Palestinians. But the Biden administration has done little to address these questions, preferring to rely on mildly expressed cautions and decades-old talking points that reflect a more hopeful time and a more liberal Israel.
Syria: The Forgotten Conflict
Biden has talked tough on other issues too, proclaiming maximalist goals that the administration has done nothing to support. Take Syria: Biden recently told a group of Syrian activists at a fundraiser in Washington that he supports the goal of removing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad from power, affirming his view that Assad must leave, according to activists present at the event. Biden’s stance thus appears little changed from that of the Obama administration, which openly supported Assad’s ouster as a key tenet of US policy. But the window of opportunity to do so has long since slammed shut. In practice, Biden attaches little strategic importance to Syria, and has done virtually nothing to bring about an end to the war, negotiated or otherwise. The United States maintains some 900 troops in country, whose mission is focused on preventing the resurgence of the so-called Islamic State, but the political solution that the administration still claims is key to ending the conflict is nowhere on its agenda. Tellingly, the Biden administration offered, at best, tepid objections to the Arab League’s recent rehabilitation of the Assad regime.
Iran, Human Rights, and the Lagging Democracy Agenda
The story is similar on Iran. Biden himself has said he stands with the country’s anti-government protesters, and has expressed support for regime change, telling supporters last November that, “We’re gonna free Iran.” The reality is that the administration professes no such policy, and appears conflicted about the strategy it should adopt. With the collapse of negotiations over restoring the nuclear deal, there seems to be little in the way of a clear Iran policy at all, except pursuing low-key proximity talks in Oman aimed at reducing tensions amid faltering US efforts to deter and contain the Islamic Republic. If history is any guide, these talks are unlikely to produce any kind of lasting commitment to a potential cessation of the activities driving tensions, let alone a lasting rapprochement. The US foreign policy conundrum of Iran remains unsolved.
Then there is the avowed intention to take Saudi Arabia and Egypt to task for their manifold human rights violations. In Riyadh’s case this includes the murder of US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the CIA believes was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud (known as MBS). On the campaign trail in 2019 and 2020, Biden famously promised to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah,” and insisted that with him as president, there would be “no more blank checks” for former President Donald Trump’s “favorite dictator,” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Both pledges were quickly abandoned once they collided with reality. After some early hemming and hawing, the administration approved a massive $2.5 billion arms sale to Cairo in 2022 and quickly reverted to business as usual, praising Egypt for its leadership and acquiescing to Cairo’s hosting of the COP27 international climate meeting.
With Saudi-Israel rapprochement now at the top of the Biden administration’s to-do list, any worries about human rights are an afterthought.
Biden’s concern about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record mostly vanished in the face of rising energy prices and the Ukraine crisis, culminating in a controversial fence-mending trip to the kingdom last year, during which the president notoriously fist-bumped MBS in greeting, an unfortunate photo-op that fueled intense criticism from human rights circles. With Saudi-Israel rapprochement now at the top of the Biden administration’s to-do list in the Middle East, any worries about human rights in the kingdom—not to mention its close cooperation with Russia—are an afterthought.
Egypt and Saudi Arabia are more the rule than the exception. For all Biden’s talk of putting human rights at “the center of our foreign policy” and his rhetoric about the conflict between democracy and authoritarianism, which he has framed as an existential concern for American foreign policy, his administration has been oddly quiet on the subject of just and democratic governance in Arabic-speaking countries. Biden’s major initiative in this regard, the 2021 Summit for Democracy, was barely mentioned the Middle East and included only two speakers from the region on its formal agenda.
When Reach Exceeds Grasp
Biden and his foreign policy advisors seem to have imagined a much bolder and more straightforward Middle East strategy than they have actually pursued in practice. Instead, the administration has essentially adopted Donald Trump’s Middle East policy, placing its bets on Trump’s Abraham Accords as the foundation of a strategy aimed at building economic, security, and military ties among the leading Arab states and Israel. With its disregard for some important realities, even this approach has its imaginary elements. In particular, the apparent belief that the trickle-down economics of regional dealmaking will do enough to allay Palestinian grievances in place of a final status settlement is a tactic that did not work in the 1990s during Bill Clinton’s intensive push for an agreement, and that will not work now.
Likewise, hopes for the full integration of Israel into the region seem unrealistic, given that large majorities of Arab citizens oppose diplomatic recognition of the state. Not that the opinions of citizens have mattered greatly to Arab governments, but they do have an impact on practical matters such as trade and tourism, and condition the extent to which rulers are likely to expand the scope of relations, at least in public.
The Saudi Gambit
In this regard, the diplomatic effort to achieve a deal for Saudi recognition of Israel ranks as the administration’s boldest Middle East initiative to date. Intended as the capstone of Arab-Israeli peace, such an agreement would fundamentally shift the politics of the region. As part of the package, conditions under negotiation reportedly include American aid for the kingdom’s civilian nuclear program and US security guarantees for Riyadh, in exchange for unspecified Israeli concessions to the Palestinians.
All of these are a tall order; Riyadh’s demands seem unlikely at this point to pass muster with the US Senate, which must approve any such treaty commitment, while Israel’s right-wing and increasingly erratic government is not expected to endorse political or economic measures significant enough to assuage Saudi sensibilities regarding the Palestinians. In fact, any Saudi-Israeli agreement would likely require the complete abandonment by Riyadh of the Arab Peace Initiative authored and proposed by the kingdom in 2002, which would require major territorial givebacks by Israel, the establishment of a Palestinian capital city in East Jerusalem, and the return of a large number of Palestinian refugees in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution 194. This proposal is still, technically, the bedrock of Riyadh’s Israel-Palestine policy, and is widely supported, in principle, by other Arab states. Despite the difficulties involved, the Biden administration must be commended on the imaginative leap involved in pursuing a normalization deal while ignoring Saudi policy.
Imagination is Good. But Failure Is an Option Too
No American president is a stranger to hypocrisy, especially when it comes to the Middle East, and Joe Biden is well known to be prone to gaffes and rhetorical flights of fancy. But in this case Biden’s adherence to obsolete diplomatic formulations and wishful thinking is more than just political double talk or forgivable hyperbole. It produces confusion among both friends and adversaries in the region and weakens America by making Washington appear feckless or naive. The failure of bold, yet risky and improbable initiatives creates the appearance of incompetence and fosters distrust in US diplomacy. This damages US credibility and leadership, prompting allies to look for support elsewhere, as Saudi Arabia and others have done with China. Imagination is good for the spirit, and sometimes even for foreign policy. But when it comes to a region as volatile and cynical as the Middle East, it can do more harm than good, for both the region and for US interests.

Steven Simon
This autumn the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington will welcome Steven Simon, an award-winning author and former U.S. National Security Council member and diplomat, as a distinguished practitioner to teach, conduct research and engage with the public on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. He will be in residence at the Jackson School for the academic year 2023-2024.
The role, to be known as “Professor of Practice in Middle East Studies,” is to enhance student learning, contribute to new scholarship, and widen community engagement on the Middle East from a policy perspective.
“Steven has a unique, insider’s perspective on some of the most significant American foreign engagements since the end of the Cold War.  We are thrilled that he will be with us for the year, sharing his experiences and his expertise with our students and our community,” said Danny Hoffman, director of the Jackson School.
Simon, most recently the Robert E. Wilhelm Fellow in International Affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Senior Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, brings extensive first-hand knowledge of the issues in the Middle East region. He served as the National Security Council senior director for counterterrorism in the Clinton White House and for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama White House and in senior positions at the U.S. Department of State. Outside of government, Simon has worked in high-level roles with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and Manama, and with the RAND Corporation and Council on Foreign Relations.
“I’m looking forward to working with such a distinguished faculty and collaborating with students who are curious about the Middle East, American foreign policy and national security decision making, and of course those who are contemplating a career involving the Middle East, whether in government, multilateral organizations, NGO’s or the media,” said Simon.
His books include as co-author of “The Age of Sacred Terror” (Random House, 2004), winner of the Arthur C. Ross Award for best book in international relations and of “The Next Attack” (Henry Holt, 2006), a finalist for the Lionel Gelber Prize, and one of the “best books of the year” in the Washington Post and Financial Times, which focused on the U.S. response to 9/11. His most recent book is “Grand Delusion: The Rise and Fall of American Ambition in the Middle East,” (Penguin/Random House, 2023). He has published in the New York Times, Washington Post, Financial Times, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Politico, New York Review of Books, Survival, and Haaretz, and has appeared on the PBS NewsHour, CNN and al Jazeera.
In autumn quarter, he will teach a JSIS B 100 course called, “US and the Middle East,” which will explore the history of U.S. involvement in the Middle East from the early Republic through the present day, and learn why and how the U.S. embarked on a series of interventions in the region, beginning in the 1980s that lasted nearly 40 years, cost trillions, killed hundreds of thousands, and subsided only recently. Simon will also be giving a public lecture, “The Rise and Fall of American Ambition in the Middle East,” hosted by the Jackson School in partnership with the Middle East Center, Center for Global Studies, and Department of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures at the University of Washington on October 19 at 7:30 p.m.

One Step Forward, Two Steps Behind: The US Shift Away From the Middle East
May 17, 2023
By Meheer Commuri | Perry World House Undergraduate Essay Prize 2023
Meheer Commuri is a rising junior from New York studying International Relations in the School of Arts and Sciences. When not discussing foreign policy, he writes for Punch Bowl, Penn’s satirical magazine. He is also a member of the Philomathean Society.
Introduction
US foreign policy is undergoing a shift in priorities, and global power dynamics are shifting with it. After a period of prolonged preoccupation with the Middle East, the U.S. has signaled a declining interest in the region. Instead, China (and more broadly the Asia-Pacific region) has emerged as the new focus. Both China and the Middle East recognize this shift. Beijing is gearing up to confront what it views as the key threat to its ascent on the international stage while the Middle East is bewildered and “running for cover.” This essay analyzes the global implications of the US priority  shift and discusses the formal and structural changes representing the shift in focus to China;  the signaling of disinterest and disengagement in the Middle East; the consequential and resultant shifts in regional power dynamics; and how the US policy should respond.
The Shift to China
Unlike in their domestic policies, Presidents Biden and Trump bear similarities in foreign policy. Trump was quick to position China at the center of his foreign policy agenda. Under his tenure, the U.S. levied additional tariffs on Chinese goods and saw “at least 210 public actions related to China that spanned at least 10 departments” in a whole-of-government approach (WGA). Biden retained Trump’s tough-on-China strategy and signaled a continuity in the focus on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). While it was former President Barak Obama who first stated his intent to pivot to Asia, the shift should be attributed mostly to Trump first, and now Biden.
Despite the similarity in direction, there are differences between the Trump and Biden strategies toward China. Critically, whereas the Trump administration made China the central focus of US foreign policy, the Biden administration formally shifted US foreign policy to China and away from the Middle East.
National security adviser Jake Sullivan has restructured the National Security staff in the Middle East and Asia directorates — downsizing the team devoted to the Middle East and bulking up the unit that coordinates US policy toward the vast region of the world stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific… The changes essentially flip the structure of the Obama-era NSC, where the Middle East directorate was much bigger than it is now and the Asia portfolio was managed by a handful of more junior staffers..
The National Security Council now operates under the pretense that China and Russia present the primary challenges to the US, the West, and the liberal international order and are America’s biggest security challenge going forward.
Signaling Disengagement with the Middle East
On the hand, Middle East policy has morphed into passive observance. Perhaps the most compelling signal regarding the US disengagement with the Middle East was the inconsistency in the policy toward the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA; Iran Nuclear Deal) US foreign policy has engaged in alarming about turns, from championing the JCPOA, to walking away from it, to signaling renewed interest. The world used to believe that US foreign policy trajectory relies more on a set of overarching values and institutional precedents and not solely on the whims of the White House. The Middle East no longer values this inference. The hasty withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan and the continued absence of a plan for the role the US will play in the region has also startled the leaders in the Middle East. They have interpreted it not only as a lack of interest in anything other than China (and now Russia), but also as an explicit disengagement and even disconnection from everything that is not China (and now Russia).
As the last US plane departed Kabul in 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken remarked, “A new chapter of America’s engagement with Afghanistan has begun… the military mission is over, a new, diplomatic mission has begun.” Almost two years later, the US Embassy in Kabul remains unoccupied. For leaders in the Middle East, this appears less about a new chapter and more about closing the book. The Middle East has now decided move on as well.
The Consequences
As a result of American regional disengagement, many regional powers in both the Middle East and the broader Arab World find themselves with more license to chart a new direction. Two shifts have emerged as the most salient from an American perspective: the normalization of Iran and Syria. The US reversals on the Iran nuclear deal dented the confidence of the ‘anti-Iran’ coalition that the U.S. had worked to build. Though countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel did not need the US to tell them to dislike Iran, others, like “the United Arab Emirates, for instance, [are] taking steps to de-escalate [their] own tensions with Tehran, after years of striking a harsher tone.” In the post-American Middle East, the UAE is increasing its efforts to be seen as a regional power, especially among the Gulf Countries. Part of this includes a far-reaching, rapprochement-styled foreign policy that has made it one of the first major, non-allied countries to normalize relations with both Iran and Syria following the U.S.’s disengagement.
Even Saudi Arabia appears keen to “shed its reputation as an American client state” and chart its own foreign policy, now absent of previous American pressures. Mediated by China, Saudi Arabia is now attempting to normalize relations with Iran. Saudi Arabia has reappointed an envoy to Tehran and reopened their embassy in the city while Iran’s finance minister visited Jeddah discuss possible economic cooperation. This would have been unimaginable even just a few years ago in a Saudi Arabia more supported by US, able to uphold its proxy conflicts with Iran. Without the US commitment, Saudi Arabia is forced to be less brazen and more realistic about the path forward. It is also no coincidence that Beijing was the moderator as it has been working to replace US influence in the Middle East. China has turned to the Middle East and North Africa to diversify its oil imports, speeding up an already growing investment and engagement in the region. In 2021, Chinese investment in the region increased by roughly 360%, while Chinese construction rose by 116% year-on-year. Chinese investment is going to previously reliable American allies such as Jordan, Oman, Egypt, and of course, Saudi Arabia. And this is not including the cooperation between China and the GCC and China and the Arab League. The Saudi Arabia-Iran negotiations acted as a signal of China’s undercutting of American power in the region. The US has shifted away from the Middle East to combat the rise of China. Ironically, that very shift has allowed China to elevate its standing in the Middle East.
The normalization of Syria is even more interesting as Syria returned to the ‘Arab fold’ almost as rapidly as it was shunned. Though Western sanctions against Syria began during the country’s occupation of Lebanon and the alleged state-sponsoring of Hezbollah, the brunt of Western-led efforts to isolate and undermine the country would occur 30 years later at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. Prodded by the US, 18 of the 22 Arab League member states present during an emergency meeting supported Syria’s suspension. Yet, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad is the only target of the Arab Spring to have survived the movement. The region is now waking up to the fact that, having come out on top from Arab Spring and then the Syrian Civil War, Assad is not going anywhere. More than a decade after its suspension from the Arab League, the 13 attending members voted unanimously to readmit Syria. With Washington looking elsewhere, the region is rebuilding relationships with Assad. This marks a startling and a “significant shift in US policy, as represented by the 2019 Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.”
On March 18, 2023, Assad visited the UAE. The visit was the culmination of the careful, regional rapprochement and renormalization. The UAE, Bahrain, and even Egypt and Saudi Arabia have all deepened their relations with Syria since 2018. Oman, a country that enjoys a strong diplomatic and defense relationship with the US, is now boosting its engagement with Syria, as is Egypt. American allies in the Middle East feel comfortable meeting with the government that was for so long the central American enemy in the region, clearly signaling the loss of US importance to the Arab fold. In response to Western finger-pointing, leaders like the UAE’s Mohamed bin Zayed respond that they are merely looking pragmatically for internal solutions to regional stability. The situation in Syria bears similarity to that of Iran. In both cases, the US worked tremendously hard at the regional and international levels to build coalitions of opposition against the two countries. Then, the US, in their rather sudden reorientation, decided to cut its losses with these coalitions, look the other way, and watch them unravel as a new regional fold emerged in their place.
How U.S. Policy Should Respond
The U.S. must seek to reengage the Middle East and give regional leaders a genuine sense of U.S. commitment. This starts with pragmatism. China is currently courting the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Iran with investments for access to oil. It is also looking to expand the Belt and Road Initiative into the Middle East though significant increasing its infrastructure and construction projects in GCC countries and other parts of the region. China’s interest in the Middle East now rivals its interest in Sub-Saharan Africa. China has $300 billon in current investments in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to $273 billion in the Middle East and North Africa. The U.S. should not look away idly as the region welcomes Beijing. China has signed deals with “Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Bahrain, and Oman—all places where the U.S. has strong political, military, and economic ties.”. China and the Middle East are not natural friends, the treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang does not escape regional leaders. Therefore, it is possible for the U.S., even now, to compete against China in the region. The U.S. can capitalize on China’s treatment of their Muslim populations, highlight previous failures of countries who opted to join the BRI, and offer comparable alternatives to Chinese technology.
The first thing that the U.S. should do is engage with the Middle East on the region’s terms. US In the past, US foreign policy has adopted a binary stance on the Middle East of “all-in or all-out.” Instead, the US must engage with the Middle East as the Middle East would like to be engaged. This does not mean pandering or appeasing to regional demands. Instead, the US should choose a third position and pursue serious diplomatic engagement and investment that commitment the US to the region long-term This can be done through resuming military cooperation or through economic cooperation. This leads to the second policy recommendation for the US, expand investment and economic cooperation with the region. China is investing heavily in the GCC with Chinese firms providing technology, infrastructure development, nuclear and renewable energy, finance, logistics, arms production, and telecommunications. To avoid the region becoming wrapped in a Chinese “surveillance blanket,” the West should provide the GCC with credible technological and energy alternatives and Free Trade Agreements(FTAs).  FTAs are perhaps the best alternative the US could present the GCC for their ever-increasing trade and investment with China. FTAs would enable American firms to complete against Chinese ones in a wide range of industries, the most important being technology.
FTAs would promote and encourage trade partnerships and investment in Gulf ventures. Furthermore, they would also serve as a good model in assisting GCC countries in building bureaucratic and institutional capacity to engage in these negotiations and partnerships, which they can later use with other countries, including China, especially regarding regulatory issues.
Washington must realize that it is difficult to rank regions of the world in terms of their value to the US Headlines in magazines lamenting the irrelevance of the Middle East are not only trite but grossly misleading. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in Foreign Affairs that diplomacy in the Middle East can succeed where America’s past military interventions have failed. Sullivan advised that America ought to use regional diplomacy in place of military involvement to advance carefully selected interests. What Sullivan does not realize is that regional diplomacy has begun to move on without the US. So far, the US. has only signaled its disinterest and desire to disengage. Now, the US must focus on catching up in its involvement. The US gave up the Middle East in a self-proclaimed desire to commit to China. In doing so, however, has allowed China and the Middle East to commit to each other. As the US searches for growing Chinese power to counter, it need not look further than the place it is leaving.

China’s involvement in the Middle East has reshaped the region’s landscape, expanding beyond traditional energy sources to encompass economic, geopolitical, and strategic considerations. The country’s “non-interventionist” approach is appealing to Middle Eastern states, which view their growing ties with Beijing as a means of diversification. However, China’s increasing engagement poses a threat to US interests in the region and its relationships with traditional allies.
  Introduction
While the Indo-Pacific has become a focal point of the United States’ overseas strategy and diplomacy in recent years, China has emerged as a significant player in the Middle East, reshaping regional security dynamics through increased involvement. China’s interests in the region extend beyond traditional energy sources and encompass economic, geopolitical, and strategic considerations. In fact, China has signed strategic partnerships and memoranda of understanding for its economic activities with most Middle Eastern countries. This is not a new trend. China established closer relationships with various regional organizations over the past two decades, including the China-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Strategic Dialogue in 2010 and, even earlier, the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum (CASCF) in 2004. Meanwhile, its 2016 Arab paper policy has been a roadmap to the country’s regional interests and policies.
Recent diplomatic initiatives by China demonstrate Beijing’s deep investment in continuing to develop relations with countries in the Middle East. In 2022, China held its first China-Arab States Summit and its first China-GCC Summit, showcasing its commitment to fostering strategic partnerships in the region and promoting economic development beyond its traditional energy interests. The increasing involvement of China in the Middle East is a significant factor shaping the region’s geopolitical landscape and has substantial implications for global politics, and is evidence that China’s economic and political interests have expanded globally under its efforts to secure access to vital resources and markets in the Middle East.
  Economics and Infrastructure
In the economic domain, China increased its trade with the region and, in 2020, replaced the European Union as the GCC’s largest trading partner with bilateral trade. Additionally, China is now Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s largest non-oil trading partner globally, and the UAE remained China’s second-largest trading partner. At the same time, a free trade agreement (FTA) with GCC members has been high on the list of China’s diplomatic agenda.
In addition, Beijing has also expanded its investment ventures in the Middle East through its poster child, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has become a vital tool of Chinese foreign policy. The Middle East is especially important to the maritime element of the BRI (MSRI) due to China’s dependency on energy imports. In fact, according to the China BRI Investment Report 2021, the majority of Chinese BRI investment projects in 2021 targeted the MENA region. In 2022, Middle Eastern countries expanded their cooperation with China and received about 23 percent of Chinese BRI engagement, up from 16.5 percent in the previous year. China has invested in the Red Sea Gateway Terminal––a joint venture between China’s COSCO Shipping Ports and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to develop and operate a container terminal at Jeddah Islamic Port––while other projects include those in the TEDA area of the Suez Canal Authority and the operation of the new port terminal in Haifa Bay. At the same time, Iraq was the top recipient of China’s BRI financing for infrastructure projects in 2021, with about $10.5 billion in construction contracts. China further sought to invest $10 billion in infrastructure projects in the Autonomous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq. Of great significance has been the Iran-China “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership” agreement, which is estimated to be $400 billion, corresponding to 10 percent of China’s total BRI budget and stipulates the joint development of the port of Chabahar and a new oil terminal near the Jask port, south of the Strait of Hormuz. This constitutes an exciting new development since the port was traditionally under a long-term contract with India.
  Digital Technology
Beijing also has big plans to extend its digital footprint to the region. The Middle East plays a prominent role in China’s Digital Silk Road under which Chinese companies have secured 5G deals with the GCC countries. China has also been collaborating in strengthening local cyber strategies with the UAE. These agreements contribute to China’s transition to a technological power of its magnitude, upending its “copycat” label. The focus on technology has been important for both sides. While China seeks to expand its role as a high-tech power and use data as a tool to promote economic transformation and development, Middle Eastern countries are increasingly looking to digitize and diversify their economies. In fact, Saudi Arabia is now supporting Chinese investments in advanced technology and research. China has also boosted its cooperation with Israel in technology and infrastructure, raising concerns in Washington around security cooperation between the two countries.
  Diplomatic Stability 
As one of the world’s leading powers, China has a vested interest in maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East given its reliance on oil imports from the region. Simultaneously, Middle Eastern countries have increasingly found China’s principle of non-interference and commitment to safeguarding common interests through independence and autonomy to be an appealing option as they seek to diversify their economic and security ties. This approach aligns with the Middle Eastern countries’ desire for greater autonomy and flexibility in their foreign relations. Hence, China’s position as a neutral, non-aligned player in the region has given Beijing a unique ability to increase its engagement in peace promotion and mediation efforts over recent years in some of the region’s most high-profile conflicts, such as those in Syria and Yemen, the peace negotiation in Afghanistan, and of course, the JCPOA negotiations. Its biggest achievement, however, has been fostering an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2023.
This diplomatic “victory” managed to defuse regional tensions and bring Middle Eastern countries closer to Beijing’s sphere of influence. By advocating that oil transactions take place in yuan, stirring Saudi Arabia and Iran’s willingness to join BRICS, as well as attempting to push for the “de-dollarization” of the international economy, China continues to pursue multipolarity, an essential priority of its foreign policy. Despite the United States’ optimistic outlook on the new agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, citing its potential “to help reduce tensions, avoid conflict, and curb in any way dangerous or destabilizing actions by Iran,” there are concerns in Washington in regards to the way the agreement has been portrayed in Iranian news outlets as a “strategic peace” against US hegemony.
Meanwhile, in the military domain, China has increased its arms sales to the Middle East, conducted military exercises with the region’s two most prominent actors (Saudi Arabia and Iran, accompanied by Russia), and promoted joint weapons production. These developments are crucial, given the stalemate in the United States’ relations with Middle East countries and its refusal to sell them more advanced weapons, a gap that China has rushed to fill by exporting advanced weapons, including Dongfeng ballistic missiles and Wing Loong Bomber drones, to several regional states. Such exports indicate that China’s supply of arms to countries frequently subjected to international sanctions or embargoes falls under its non-interference principle, making it a preferred exporter for the region’s countries. Notwithstanding, three countries from the Middle East––Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar––have become members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the largest and most populous regional cooperation organization which has been considered as a counterweight to US interests in Eurasia. Others have already expressed their willingness to do so, indicating stronger alignment with Beijing and Moscow and an intention to counter American influence in the wider region.
Finally, China has advanced its soft power projection in the region with a number of humanitarian initiatives, recognizing that soft power is essential for its status as a great power. Such initiatives include medical aid during the COVID-19 pandemic, cultural promotion with a focus on strengthening people-to-people relations mainly through tourism which has seen a surge in the recent years, educational initiatives through university exchanges and cooperation, and the establishment of Confucius institutes in the Middle East (numbering fifteen as of 2021). All of these initiatives constitute an attempt to secure a positive image in the region and highlight China’s role as a responsible power and a trustworthy partner.
  Implications for the United States
The growing presence of China in the Middle East has significant implications for various regional actors—including Russia, one of its closest partners—especially regarding arms sales. Some of Russia’s most critical weapons importers may prefer China as a source, which could strain the relationship between the two countries in the midst of the war in Ukraine. In addition, a potential closer convergence of Middle Eastern states could give rise to new regional dynamics and create significant tensions, particularly for Israel, and by extension, the United States. As China strengthens its economic ties with the Middle East, it will seek to challenge the United States’ predominance in the region. However, given their reliance on US military bases and weapons imports, Arab states are unlikely to fully annul their security relationship with the United States in the short term. Another key development is that Iran’s improved relations with Middle Eastern states and expanding trade and military cooperation with China and Russia will likely render the JCPOA obsolete.
The future of US foreign policy in the Middle East is highly contingent on the new administration’s approach, specifically regarding their strategy for engaging with Arab states and managing tensions with Iran. One possible strategy is a “divide and conquer” approach, as adopted under Trump’s administration, which seeks to isolate Iran and strengthen alliances with Arab states. Another approach could be more isolationist, as seen under Biden, in which US involvement in the region is deprioritized. However, given the current security dynamics, the United States should adopt a more nuanced approach prioritizing diplomacy and multilateralism as the most effective means of promoting stability. As such, the return to the JCPOA with Iran would be more conducive to securing US national interests and would have a positive impact on its relations with other countries in the Middle East.
The United States should provide its allies and partners in the region with viable alternatives to Chinese initiatives. This can be accomplished by increasing investments in the region, particularly in telecommunications and infrastructure. In addition, it is essential not to take a confrontational approach towards China’s role in the region. Instead, the United States should lead by attraction rather than coercion and allow countries in the Middle East to freely choose between it and China. This can be achieved through the promotion of cultural and educational initiatives to foster mutual understanding and appreciation for each other’s traditions and values, sports diplomacy given the Middle East’s expanding participation in international sporting events, and through development aid to counter China’s infrastructure offensive in the Middle East. In doing so, the United States can establish itself as a dependable partner, creating stronger relationships with countries in the Middle East.

Biden Needs to Rethink His Middle East Agenda

Despite minimal payoff from U.S. President Joe Biden’s visit to the Middle East last summer, Washington has nonetheless scored some diplomatic wins over the past year. In October, the United States brokered a historic agreement that settled a years-long maritime border dispute between Israel and Lebanon. The Biden administration also built some momentum on efforts to promote regional integration with the creation of the Negev Forum—comprising Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and the U.S.—as well as initiatives advancing defense cooperation between Israel and Washington’s Arab partners in the Middle East.
These steps signal movement toward Washington’s priorities in the region: Israel’s integration into the broader Middle East, the de-escalation of regional conflicts and a collective effort to contain Iran. But the gains Washington has made have now run into significant yet predictable headwinds, highlighting the difficulties facing Biden’s regional agenda.
First, consider Iran. Despite brutally quashing the inspiring women-led protest movement that emerged last September, Tehran has all but broken out of its regional and international isolation through normalization agreements with its Gulf Arab neighbors—first with the UAE, and then more significantly with its regional rival, Saudi Arabia. While Iran and Saudi Arabia had engaged in dialogues hosted by regional neighbors like Iraq and Oman for the past several years, the prominent Chinese role in pushing normalization across the finish line in March took many by surprise and fueled already widespread perceptions of declining U.S. relevance in regional affairs.

  Where Students Find Value at the Elliott School
While academic experience inside the classroom is a crucial consideration as you narrow down your list of top Middle East Studies programs, where you learn can be just as important. The program you choose will impact everything from work and internship experience to the number of opportunities you have to connect with leaders in the field.
The D.C. Experience 
Situated in the heart of the nation’s capital, you’ll be minutes away from the year’s biggest events, networking opportunities, and speeches delivered by world leaders. You’ll also be within walking distance of important organizations, such as the World Bank, the State Department, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and USAID. For most students, this means the opportunity to gain professional experience during the day before walking or taking the Metro to campus for night courses.
Learn more about what your experience will look like.
A Leading Institute
Through the Institute for Middle East Studies (IMES), you’ll have opportunities to engage in open and informed dialogue on pressing issues, such as famine and food in the Middle East, gender equality, the media’s role in the invasion of Iraq, and the division versus one-state reality of Israel and Palestine. Named a National Resource Center and a designated recipient of the federally-funded FLAS language fellowship program, IMES is a hub for the country’s leading political scientists specializing in the region. You’ll hear from and engage with faculty as well as visiting scholars, such as Graham Auman Pitts, Oussema Othmeni, Jackson Perry, and Dr. Emma Soubrier.  
Networking Opportunities
This field moves quickly and organizations often want to hire immediately. To be considered for top internships, think tanks, and positions, the personal connections you make are vital. The Elliott School’s alumni network and Career Resources can help you make advantageous connections so you’re entering strategic conversations. 
""There are lots of schools and programs, but your experience as a student will be largely shaped by the time you spend outside of the classroom. The opportunities I have had to meet decision-makers, learn from experts, and network with prominent alumni simply would not be possible in any other city.""

Trita Parsi
Trita Parsi is an award-winning author and the 2010 recipient of the Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. He is an expert on US-Iranian relations, Iranian foreign policy, and the geopolitics of the Middle East. He has authored three books on US foreign policy in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Iran and Israel. He was named by the Washingtonian Magazine as one of the 25 most influential voices on foreign policy in Washington DC in both 2021 and 2022, and preeminent public intellectual Noam Chomsky calls Parsi “one of the most distinguished scholars on Iran.”
His first book, Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Iran, Israel and the United States (Yale University Press, 2007), won the silver medal winner of the 2008 Arthur Ross Book Award from the Council on Foreign Relations. His second book, A Single Roll of the Dice – Obama’s Diplomacy with Iran (Yale University Press, 2012) and was selected by Foreign Affairs as the Best Book of 2012 on the Middle East.
Parsi’s latest book – Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy (Yale University Press, 2017) – reveals the behind the scenes story to the nuclear deal with Iran.
Parsi was born in Iran but moved with his family at the age of four to Sweden in order to escape political repression in Iran. His father was an outspoken academic who was jailed by the Shah and then by the Ayatollah. He moved to the United States as an adult and studied foreign policy at Johns Hopkins’ School for Advanced International Studies where he received his PhD under Francis Fukuyama and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
He is the co-founder and former President of the National Iranian American Council. Parsi has followed Middle East politics through work in the field and extensive experience on Capitol Hill and at the United Nations.

Defense Official Says U.S. Remains Committed to Middle East
June 5, 2023 | By C. Todd Lopez , DOD News |
With over 30,000 troops in the Middle East at multiple locations, the United States' commitment to the Middle East hasn't changed — despite the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and its significant drawdown in Iraq, said the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East.
""The significant capabilities across our Navy, our Air Force, our Army and our Marines — it's still in the region,"" Dana Stroul told the Jerusalem Post during an interview yesterday in New York City. ""And they're still doing those important activities every day.""
Although the U.S. at one time had more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan and more than 160,000 troops in Iraq, the military pulled out of Afghanistan completely in 2021. And, in Iraq, operations are limited now to just a handful of troops performing advise-and-assist missions only. 
But elsewhere in U.S. Central Command, the U.S. force presence hasn't changed, said Stroul. Despite a public focus on the Indo-Pacific region, the U.S. has maintained troop levels and a presence.
""Our senior leaders talk about China as the pacing challenge and Russia as the acute threat,"" Stroul said. ""What our friends and allies in the Middle East don't hear is ... how the United States racks and stacks the threats and how we're going to prepare for them. And people are nervous. They think it means that the United States and the U.S. government is deprioritizing the Middle East."" 
The preeminent threat in the Middle East, Stroul said, is Iran, and Iran's efforts to have a nuclear weapon. That's something she said the U.S. doesn't want to happen. 
""President [Joe] Biden has been quite clear that on his watch Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon, and he means it,"" Stroul said.
The preferred method to ensure Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon, Stroul said, is the diplomatic course. But that has to be backed up with a willingness and a capability to use force, if necessary. 
""Secretary [Lloyd J.] Austin's job is to ensure that should President Biden ask for the military plans and options, he's ready to provide them,"" she said. ""And my job as the deputy assistant secretary of defense is to make sure that we're on top of that."" 
Part of ensuring a credible military option, Stroul said, is the strong U.S. relationship with Israel. 
""Our partnership in the Department of Defense with the Israeli ministry of defense and the Israeli Defense Forces is incredibly important,"" Stroul said. ""In fact, it's critical. So, we are working every day to deepen and increase our military cooperation with Israel.""
The work includes, among other things, intelligence sharing and military exercises.


In January, for instance, the U.S. and Israel concluded the largest military exercise the nations have held together: Juniper Oak 23.2. More than 7,000 personnel participated in the all-domain exercise, which was meant to ensure the U.S. and Israel are able to work together militarily in an emergency, Stroul said. 
""It's also to make sure that both our other friends and allies in the region and our adversaries are taking note of the critical work we're doing together to be prepared should military force be required,"" she said.

30,US Middle East Policy: The Trump-Biden Doctrine in Action,https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/us-middle-east-policy-the-trump-biden-doctrine-in-action/,20232-20232,"US Middle East Policy: The Trump-Biden Doctrine in Action
Mar 22, 2023 Charles W. Dunne
All US presidents, it seems, need their own foreign policy “doctrine.” President James Monroe famously started the trend in 1823, and many others—Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Carter, Bush, and Obama, to name a few—followed in his footsteps. Presidents deploy these doctrines to enunciate a powerful statement of national purpose and resolve on the global stage, usually involving a declaration of high principles and, all too often, an implied warning of military action, when necessary, in defense of American interests.
In Washington foreign policy circles today, there is talk of an emerging “Biden Doctrine.” It has broadly been defined as the imperative of exercising US leadership in the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism—a struggle that is mainly fought on ideological grounds, but sometimes on actual battlegrounds, as in Ukraine.
As with most other presidential doctrines from the last 75 years, the Biden doctrine means one thing on the world stage and something else in the Middle East. High-minded and principled when applied to the broader global struggle against the advance of autocracy and repression, in the Middle East the Biden Doctrine does not so much reinvent the US approach to the region as reinforce its traditional emphasis on security issues, military commitments, and arms sales, while largely ignoring seemingly intractable problems such as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the destabilizing civil war in Syria, and, to a troubling extent, human rights abuses in the region. The Biden administration, it seems, has borrowed more than a few pages from the Trump playbook.
The “Trump Doctrine”—insofar as the former president had one—can be summarized as “America First,” or as the 2017 National Security Strategy more elegantly put it, “principled realism.” In the Middle East, this translated into steady relations with ruling elites, a preoccupation with arms sales and security issues, downplaying human rights and democracy, and ignoring the Palestinian-Israeli conflict by moving the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, punishing the Palestinians with aid cutoffs, and focusing instead on regional integration via the Abraham Accords, Trump’s main foreign policy achievement. Despite sweeping changes in rhetoric and some policy tweaks to his predecessor’s approach, President Biden’s doctrine in the Middle East might more accurately be called the Trump-Biden Doctrine.
The Biden Doctrine Emerges
Shortly after the Biden administration took office in 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken heralded the president’s approach to global affairs with a pledge to place “human rights at the center of US foreign policy,” and, as Biden said in his 2022 State of the Union Speech, to take the field in “the battle between democracy and autocracies.” Biden’s Summit for Democracy in December 2021 set the stage and named the stakes; US support for Ukraine after the February 2022 Russian invasion became the focal point and rallying cry. The new approach was intended, in part, to distinguish Biden from his predecessor, who generally minimized human rights in his foreign policy and famously befriended autocrats, including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s controversial crown prince.
The “Biden Doctrine,” as it has come to be called, aims at revitalizing democracy as a model of good governance capable of “defending freedom, championing opportunity, upholding universal rights, respecting the rule of law, and treating every person with dignity,” as Biden himself put it. The second Summit for Democracy, scheduled to take place later this month, is designed to build global momentum to address “emerging challenges to democracy” worldwide.
The Biden Doctrine in the Middle East, Explained
In a speech at the Atlantic Council’s inaugural Rafik Hariri Awards in February 2023, Brett McGurk, the National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, spelled out how the “Biden Doctrine…now guides US engagement in the region.” Its key elements were articulated by the president in his meeting with the GCC+3 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in July 2022, and were incorporated into the administration’s National Security Strategy three months later. The doctrine rests on five “declaratory principles”: partnerships, deterrence, diplomacy, integration, and values.
The first of these, partnerships, “guides everything we do,” McGurk explained in his speech. The approach centers on “the expansion and deepening of the Abraham Accords, or new formats such as the Negev Forum.” The forum, named for a desert summit hosted by Israel in March 2022, includes the four main signatories of the Abraham Accords, plus Egypt and the United States, and comprises a framework of working groups designed to build out Arab-Israeli relations in the diplomatic, economic, and security fields, with parallel work also continuing in bilateral diplomatic contacts between the parties.
The principle of deterrence, McGurk stated, means that, “The United States will not allow foreign or regional powers to jeopardize freedom of navigation through the Middle East waterways…nor tolerate efforts by any country to dominate another or the region through military buildups, incursions, or threats.” The diplomacy principle commits the United States to “reduce tensions wherever we can, to de-escalate, and end conflicts wherever possible through diplomacy.”
American diplomatic efforts have yielded some important results, including improvements in relations between Gulf states, an Israel-Lebanon maritime border agreement, and a cease-fire in Yemen.
The fourth principle, integration, is similar to the concept of “partnership,” involving US efforts to foster “political, economic, security connections between US partners.” And the fifth principle, values, as McGurk noted, involves promoting “human rights and the values enshrined in the UN Charter.
The five principles of the Biden Doctrine in the Middle East are reasonable enough, and decidedly reflect the administration’s strategy to encourage regional parties to work together to deal with their own problems so the United States can devote more of its time and attention elsewhere. American diplomatic efforts have yielded some important results, including improvements in relations between Gulf states following a Saudi-led effort to isolate Qatar, an Israel-Lebanon maritime border agreement, and a cease-fire in Yemen, brokered in part through US diplomacy. In many ways, the emphasis on cooperative problem-solving and diplomatic engagement is both overdue and welcome. However, the supposedly fresh approach outlined in the Biden Doctrine may not be so fresh after all.
Regional Security Still the Name of the Game
In practice, it is not yet clear that the Biden Doctrine actually moves US policy in the region significantly closer to its goal of broad-based regional integration requiring less involvement from the United States. Trade relations between Arab states and Israel—one of the administration’s key aims—are soaring; but much of this is occurring bilaterally between Israel and its partners, with or without encouragement from Washington, and without taking Palestinian rights into account. The regional cooperative framework on economic and transnational issues that Biden has touted still remains largely on the drawing board. The focus areas of the Negev Forum’s working groups, where it seems much of the work on cooperative programs in health, education, water and food security, tourism, and the like will be carried out, have yet to be formally established, and any actual joint projects remain largely notional.
If cooperative efforts to address these issues are still in their infancy, security and military cooperation are not. Indeed, this is the main driver of the Biden Doctrine and the backbone of most of its declaratory principles. In his speech, McGurk highlighted the “two hundred military exercises, strategic dialogues,” and the like that have taken place so far, as well as US efforts to erect an “integrated air and maritime defense architecture in the region” and what McGurk billed as “the largest joint military exercise ever in that part of the world” (namely, Juniper Oak), among other deterrence activities, exercises, and related diplomatic efforts. The security element of the Biden Doctrine is bolstered by tens of billions of dollars in ongoing US weapons sales to the region and the burgeoning arms trade between Israel and its Arab partners.
The security sphere that is now taking shape may indeed mark the dawn of a “new Middle East.” But just as in the “old” Middle East, the United States will be required to expend massive amounts of diplomatic and military effort to knit together longstanding rivals and make the whole thing work. In fact, the depth and breadth of the security commitments that the US is reportedly considering in the region, bilaterally and collectively, strongly suggest that Washington is on course to become more deeply entrenched in the region’s security issues and not less, as earlier talk of a “pivot to Asia” and away from the Middle East has begun to fade amid new strategic realities. Saudi Arabia’s reported demand for American security guarantees as a condition for normalizing relations with Israel would, if granted, mark a major expansion of US military commitments and tie the United States even more tightly to the region, in what would be the clearest signal yet of Washington’s intention to remain the region’s strongest and most influential outside actor.
Resolving Palestine-Israel Conflict Lacks Urgency
What is most remarkable about the application of the Biden Doctrine to the Middle East is not the traditional emphasis on security issues, but the apparent abandonment of efforts to resolve two of the most dangerous and destabilizing conflicts in the Middle East: the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the civil war in Syria.
The Trump administration led the way, abandoning traditional core elements of US policy that were intended to avoid prejudging key issues in a negotiated final status agreement between Israel and Palestine. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moved the American embassy there, and closed the US consulate, which had been responsible for US relations with the Palestinians. Trump cut $200 million in bilateral assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) and ended US aid to Palestinian refugees though the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The Trump administration also recognized Israel’s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war, reversing another long-standing US policy. It further issued a half-hearted Israel-Palestine “peace plan” that imposed heavy obligations on the Palestinians in return for possible limited self-rule, and promoted the Abraham Accords to advance Arab-Israeli peace by sidestepping the Palestinian issue altogether.
The incoming Biden administration has made only minor course corrections to this set of policies. It restored aid to the Palestinians and appointed Hady Amr, a former Brookings Institution scholar, as Special Representative for Palestinian Affairs, a sort of non-resident ambassador to the Palestinians. But the other elements of Trump’s policy remain intact.
The Biden administration has neither endorsed nor pursued the Trump “peace plan,” but it has not advanced an alternative either.
The Biden administration has neither endorsed nor pursued the Trump “peace plan,” but it has not advanced an alternative either. Instead, it has warmly embraced the Abraham Accords, installing them as the foundation of its Middle East policy and the core of the Biden Doctrine in the region. The administration has demonstrated little appetite for playing an active role in re-energizing a Palestinian-Israeli peace process, and has limited itself to facilitating occasional emergency meetings to manage violence in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. During his meeting with PA President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah last July, Biden expressed sympathy for Palestinian hardships but acknowledged that “the ground is not ripe at this moment to restart negotiations.” Instead, he called only for a “reinvigorated dialogue” between the US and the PA, and pledged generic support for a “two-state solution,” which he admitted is “so far away.” He also failed to offer any ideas on how to get there.
It is no surprise, then, that the administration is content to advance its vision for regional integration without considering the Palestinians. The PA was not invited to the Negev Forum summit last year and has refused to participate in its working groups. Some observers inside and outside the administration have expressed hope that a means will be found to utilize the Negev Forum and the Abraham Accords more broadly to improve prospects for Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, but consideration of the Palestinian issue within this framework seems focused largely on what can be done to help the West Bank economically without addressing even the most basic Palestinian political demands. This tactic is essentially a rerun of the American approach to the peace process of the 1990s and early 2000s, which failed to lead either to a more prosperous Palestine or a final status agreement.
Syria Falls Down the List of US Priorities
Syria, too, has largely fallen off the administration’s radar. While US and European sanctions on the Assad regime remain in effect, the United States has done little to push for a resolution since the end of Obama’s second term in 2017. The Biden administration has maintained a small US presence in Syria focused mainly on countering the threat from the so-called Islamic State, but otherwise has largely ignored the issue, even as Russia and Iran have continued to strengthen their positions in the country, posing a heightened threat to regional stability and US influence and interests. Meanwhile, Arab leaders have begun the process of rehabilitating Assad and his regime. This is a very troubling indicator for an American policy aimed at confronting global authoritarianism and deterring military challenges to the US-backed regional order in the Middle East. Here again, Biden has seemed to take his cue from Trump, whose neglectful and haphazard Syria policy was widely criticized.
US “Values”: Missing in Action?
As mentioned above, the fifth principle of the Biden Doctrine is “values”; and here current American strategy again seems oddly passive. McGurk’s speech at the Atlantic Council neglected to specify which values the United States will valorize as it pursues its policy in the Middle East. The speech talks of “respecting each country’s sovereignty and independent choices,” while committing only to “raise concerns regarding basic rights” and to “urge partners to act in words and deeds in line with the essential principles of the UN Charter.” McGurk’s remarks did not spell out what those rights and principles are for the purposes of US policy; nor did they reference the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which would have been welcome, and even expected in such a context.
This is a far cry from the aggressive posture on human rights that Biden brought with him to office, but it is consistent with a similar formulation former President Trump delivered in his speech to Arab and Muslim heads of state in Riyadh in 2017. In that speech, Trump declared, “We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership—based on shared interests and values.” He did not, however, name those values.
This reluctance to be more specific on the practical application of American values and concern for human rights in Washington’s engagement with Middle Eastern governments might be excused as normal diplomatic reticence if it were not for the fact that Biden as president has appeared to soft-pedal the human rights abuses in the region that he seemed so eager to criticize on the campaign trail. Nothing better symbolized this retreat than the notorious “fist bump” Biden shared with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his visit to Saudi Arabia last summer. The Middle East was largely ignored during the administration’s “Summit for Democracy” in December 2021. And since then, Biden’s focus on Ukraine and energy markets has put a premium on keeping things steady in the Middle East, in part by avoiding tough talk with regional leaders. McGurk’s Atlantic Council speech suggests that this is less a temporary exigency than a settled policy course; the administration seems to have decided to downplay human rights and democracy—as well as other difficult issues such the Palestine-Israel conflict—in favor of maintaining predictable cooperative relations with Israel and the region’s autocrats.
American Ambitions Diminished
If, as the National Security Strategy notes, over the last 20 years the United States has “too often defaulted to military-centric policies,” the Biden Doctrine has so far done little to change that. In practice, the administration’s policy does not reimagine US engagement and goals in the region so much as reinforce existing policies, especially those focused on security issues and military cooperation, further entrenching the United States in the politics and problems of the region. The reluctance to seek an end to bitter conflicts in Syria and especially in Palestine, ignores two of the most important sources of instability in the Middle East. And the backtracking on human rights and democracy in favor of “regional integration” not only undermines the administration’s effort to confront global authoritarianism, but lets the region’s leaders know that they can use the Abraham Accords as an impunity shield. Given the similarities between the two administrations’ policies in the Middle East, this approach should more accurately be referred to as the Trump-Biden Doctrine.
Despite some undeniable but very confined successes, the Biden Doctrine in several important ways has shrunk the scope of American policy in the region, rather than broadened it. That may be welcome news for many in the region after decades of war, but in the end may not serve either Washington’s interests or those of the peoples of the Middle East.
