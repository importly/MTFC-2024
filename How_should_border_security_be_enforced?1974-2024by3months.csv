Migration and Borders:
Expanding Lawful Pathways +
Enhanced Enforcement
  When the CDC's Title 42 public health Order lifted at 11:59 p.m. ET on May 11, the United States returned to fully enforcing Title 8 immigration authorities to expeditiously process and remove individuals who arrive at the U.S. border unlawfully and do not have a legal basis to stay.  
These decades-old authorities carry steep consequences for unlawful entry or irregular entry, including at least a five-year bar on admission and potential criminal prosecution for repeat violators. Individuals who cross into the United States at the Southwest Border without authorization or having used a lawful pathway, and without having scheduled a time to arrive at a port of entry, would be presumed ineligible for asylum under a new proposed regulation, absent an applicable exception.
Enforcement of immigration laws under Title 8 is expected to reduce the number of repeat border crossings over time, which increased significantly under the Title 42 public health Order, since it did not allow for legal consequences.
Smugglers will continue to spread lies to lure migrants into irregular migration, placing a strain on our immigration system, our communities, and our dedicated workforce. In contrast, the following official U.S. government resources provide accurate information on how our immigration system works, and how we are expanding lawful pathways, coupled with enhanced enforcement, to reduce irregular migration and ensure safe, orderly, and humane management of our borders and our immigration system.

Defining Forced Labor | Indicators | Addressing Forced Labor | Allegations | Enforcement Process | WROs and Findings | UFLPA
CBP’s forced labor enforcement mission supports ethical and humane trade while leveling the playing field for U.S. companies that respect fair labor standards. CBP is the only U.S. government agency, and one of the few in the world, with the legal authority to take enforcement action against goods produced with forced labor to prevent entry into domestic commerce.
Forced labor is a violation of basic human rights. CBP is committed to identifying products made by forced labor and preventing them from entering the United States, thereby denying access to the U.S. economy for those that engage in the egregious human rights abuses associated with the use of forced labor.
Eradicating the use of forced labor is a moral imperative. Additionally, forced labor is an unfair trade practice that undermines the ability of companies that treat workers fairly to compete in the global economy. CBP is determined not only to prevent goods made with forced labor from entering the United States, but also to do everything within our authority to stop them from being made in the first place.
How does CBP define Forced Labor?
CBP enforces forced labor trade law under 19 U.S.C. 1307, which defines forced labor as all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty for its nonperformance and for which the worker does not offer work or service voluntarily. This includes forced or indentured child labor.
  What are the indicators of Forced Labor?
The indicators listed below were developed by the International Labour Organization. They are intended to help front-line criminal law enforcement officials, inspectors, trade union officers, NGO workers, and others to identify persons who are possibly trapped in a forced labor situation, and who may require urgent assistance. These indicators represent the most common signs that point to the possible existence of forced labor.
ILO indicators of Forced Labor
  How does CBP address Forced Labor?
CBP implements Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1307) through issuance of Withhold Release Orders (WRO) and Findings, and enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), to prevent merchandise produced in whole or in part in a foreign country using forced labor from being imported into the United States.
CBP is responsible for preventing the entry of products made with forced labor into the U.S. market by investigating and acting upon allegations of forced labor in supply chains.
How to Submit Forced Labor Allegations?
CBP regulations state that any person who has reason to believe that merchandise produced by forced labor is being, or is likely to be, imported into the United States may communicate his belief to any Port Director or the Commissioner of CBP (19 CFR 12.42). To submit information to CBP alleging merchandise was produced with forced labor, please use CBP’s eAllegations website. While allegations may be reported anonymously, those with a higher rate of successful acceptance for investigations typically provide follow-up contact information for the agency and provide specific and timely information about labor conditions and specific supply chain entities connected to the forced labor. Please reference the allegation submission checklist and recommended guidelines for supporting documentation linked below.
Forced Labor Allegation Submission Checklist
Guidelines for Submissions of Forced Labor Supporting Documents
CBP encourages stakeholders in the trade community to closely examine their supply chains to ensure goods imported into the United States are not mined, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, with prohibited forms of labor, i.e., slave, convict, indentured, forced or indentured child labor.

The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) establishes a rebuttable presumption that the importation of any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China, or produced by certain entities, is prohibited by Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and that such goods, wares, articles, and merchandise are not entitled to entry to the United States.
The UFLPA rebuttable presumption went into effect on June 21, 2022. Please visit our UFLPA webpage for all updates on implementation.

U.S. Supreme Court says Texas can’t block federal agents from the border
The high court’s order effectively maintains long-running precedent that the federal government — not individual states — has authority to enforce border security.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ordered Texas to allow federal border agents access to the state’s border with Mexico, where Texas officials have deployed miles of concertina wire.
The order did not explain justices’ decisions. For now, it effectively upholds longstanding court rulings that the Constitution gives the federal government sole responsibility for border security.
In October of last year, Texas sued the federal government after Border Patrol agents cut some of the wire strung along the Rio Grande, arguing the Department of Homeland Security destroyed the state’s property and interfered in Texas’ border security efforts.
The 5-4 order from the Supreme Court vacated a previous injunction from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that prevented Border Patrol agents from cutting the concertina wire.

In recent weeks, Shelby Park in Eagle Pass has become the center of a standoff between Texas and the federal government over immigration enforcement. Most recently, Gov. Greg Abbott has ramped up border enforcement around the 47-acre park by surrounding the perimeter by the razor wire and limiting access to the city park.
“The Biden Administration has repeatedly cut wire that Texas installed to stop illegal crossings, opening the floodgates to illegal immigrants. The absence of razor wire and other deterrence strategies encourages migrants to make unsafe and illegal crossings between ports of entry, while making the job of Texas National Guard soldiers and DPS troopers more dangerous and difficult,” Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesperson for Abbott, said in a statement. “This case is ongoing, and Governor Abbott will continue fighting to defend Texas' property and its constitutional authority to secure the border.”
In a statement Tuesday, the White House celebrated the Supreme Court's order that enabled federal authorities to “address urgent humanitarian situations and enforce our laws.”
“Texas’ political stunts, like placing razor wire near the border, simply make it harder and more dangerous for frontline personnel to do their jobs. Ultimately, we need adequate resources and policy changes to address our broken immigration system,” the statement said. “That is why on his first day in office President Biden presented Congress with a comprehensive immigration reform plan and that is why he is working to find a bipartisan agreement with Congress that includes additional resources and meaningful policy reforms.”
Biden's U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 has faced an uphill battle since he introduced it three years ago. Since then, Congress has yet to come to bipartisan agreement on how to resolve the issue as Republicans, and even some Democrats, continue to condemn the president's handling of the border.
Since 2021, Abbott’s Operation Lone Star initiative has created tension between the state and federal government. Under the operation, Abbott has deployed state troopers across the 1,200 mile Texas-Mexico border; ordered state police to arrest migrants who are suspected of trespassing; spent $11 million to install 70,000 rolls of concertina wire along the Rio Grande; and spent $1.5 billion on about a dozen miles of border walls.
As migrants have attempted to get through the wire, Border Patrol has cut through parts of the barrier to assist injured people. Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against DHS, claiming federal agents had illegally destroyed state property.
A U.S. district court judge based in Del Rio sided with the federal government, ruling that Border Patrol agents didn’t violate any laws by cutting the wire. Paxton’s office appealed, and a panel of judges from the 5th Circuit paused the ruling until the case went through the appeals process.

On Jan. 12, National Guard members blocked federal border agents from accessing the Rio Grande after three migrants drowned while crossing the river and two others were still struggling in the water, according to a court filing by the U.S. Department of Justice.
The state denied the federal agency’s version of events, arguing that Mexican officials had the situation under control in subsequent court filings.
On Monday, the Supreme Court vacated the 5th Circuit’s order after the Biden administration sent a cease and desist letter to Paxton for blocking federal access to the border. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s three liberal justices in issuing the order.
“The Supreme Court’s temporary order allows Biden to continue his illegal effort to aid the foreign invasion of America,” Paxton said in a statement. “The destruction of Texas’ border barriers will not help enforce the law or keep American citizens safe. This fight is not over, and I look forward to defending our state’s sovereignty.”

Immigration rights groups have criticized Texas officials' use of the term “invasion” for potentially inciting violence against Hispanic people.
In a separate lawsuit, President Joe Biden sued Texas over the deployment of floating barriers on the Rio Grande, also in Eagle Pass. In December, the 5th Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, ordered Texas to remove the barrier. Texas has asked the appeals court to reconsider the case.

NEW: BORDER PATROL AGENTS STUCK PROCESSING ILLEGAL ALIENS INSTEAD OF PERFORMING BORDER SECURITY MISSION
December 20, 2023
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark E. Green, MD (R-TN) issued the following statement after the Committee released new selections from transcribed interviews conducted with Border Patrol chief patrol agents responsible for the sectors along the Southwest border. These interviews confirm that significant numbers of their Border Patrol agents have been reassigned to processing and releasing illegal aliens into the country rather than patrolling the border between ports of entry. 

The chief patrol agents describe how this negatively affects morale of these agents in the field and increases the likelihood of gotaways at the border, putting U.S. homeland security at risk. Finally, several of these senior leaders describe how Border Patrol agents are being temporarily assigned to other sectors to help process surges, affecting manpower in their home sectors. 

“As some senior Border Patrol leaders told us, Border Patrol agents signed up for this job because they want to be in the field, helping secure the homeland and protect their families and communities. Under Secretary Mayorkas, however, that mission has been largely taken away from them,” Chairman Green said. “Processing and releasing illegal aliens into the interior is not the job they signed up for and it pulls them away from their vital frontline security mission. It goes directly against their law enforcement mandate to enforce consequences against lawbreaking, not reward it. It’s little wonder why agents continue to tell anyone who will listen, including this Committee, the media, and the DHS inspector general, that morale has cratered, and many are questioning why they should continue on the job. This consequence of Secretary Mayorkas’ reckless disregard for the laws of this country will reverberate for as long as his policies remain in place.”

In a notable example, on Sept. 27, 2023, Border Patrol officials in Eagle Pass, Texas, released an internal memo stating that zero Border Patrol agents were in the field between ports of entry because they had been diverted to help process aliens into the interior amid a surge in encounters. As detailed in the Phase Three interim report of the Committee’s investigation into the border crisis, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) also released a report in May 2023, documenting the mental toll inflicted on agents from being required to perform duties “that essentially run counter to [the] job description.” The OIG report detailed how overwhelming surges of illegal aliens have driven this change in agents’ mission and, as a result, has negatively impacting the mental health and morale of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel. Low morale and a decreased Border Patrol presence along the Southwest border has clearly affected the security of our nation, as detailed in the transcripts.

The House Committee on Homeland Security and the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability conducted interviews with eight chief patrol agents and one deputy chief patrol agent from April-September 2023 to acquire more information about operations in their sectors and how the crisis has impacted the safety and security of the United States. These interviews were part of the Committees’ ongoing investigation into the causes, costs, and consequences of the unprecedented crisis at America’s borders, and the role of Secretary Mayorkas in facilitating and maintaining this crisis. 

Read previous selections of the transcripts in which these senior agents discussed how they see the influx of illegal aliens during the Biden administration as unprecedented, the lack of consequences enforced by this administration for illegal entry, how these mass releases function as a pull factor for millions of illegal aliens, how illegal aliens are now turning themselves in to Border Patrol to be released into the interior, and the expansive degree of cartel control at the Southwest border.

AGENTS STUCK PROCESSING ILLEGAL ALIENS INSTEAD OF THEIR NORMAL JOB
 
Chief Patrol Agent Sean McGoffin, Big Bend Sector 

Q: Okay. And just one more question. You said that you’ve got around 17 percent of agents that are processing. Is that accurate? 

A: About 16 percent. 

Q: Sixteen percent.  

You said that most agents would rather be out in the field doing encounters.  

A: The majority, not all of them. Some of them like it. But the majority want to be out doing standard Border Patrol work in the field.  

Q: Have you heard anything from agents in other sectors that are doing more processing than you guys are in Big Bend complaining about doing processing as opposed to more traditional law enforcement? 

A: Well, I mean, I hear stuff from our agents when they come back, that they’ve said that there’s a lot of people that are stuck processing for a long time. 
 
Chief Patrol Agent Jason Owens, Del Rio Sector 

Q: Thank you. And then another sector chief informed us that Border Patrol agents really want to be in the field and doing that job. Would you agree with that statement? 

A: I would agree with that, yes.
 
Chief Patrol Agent Gregory Bovino, El Centro Sector 

Q: Did that surge have an impact on operations in El Centro? 

A: Yes. 

Q: In what way?

A: Any time there is a surge of individuals processing care, feeding and care of those individuals takes Border Patrol agents away from their primary job of preventing bad people and bad things from coming across the border. 

Q: And is that what you experienced in 2021, that agents were taken away from the border to do processing? 

A: Yes.  
 
Chief Patrol Agent John Modlin, Tucson Sector 

Q: Thank you.  

And then, you know, briefly you’ve talked about processing coordinators in your testimony in February as well as today. About what percentage of your Border Patrol agents are dedicated to processing activities?  

A: So most recently when I looked at it, it was about 38 percent of the—the Border Patrol staff in Tucson is—is doing processing/detention stuff. I think when I testified in February, it was more about 20 percent or so.  

Q: Okay. And just to be clear, Border Patrol staff, do you mean agents?  

A: Yes. Agents, yeah.  
 
Chief Patrol Agent John Modlin, Tucson Sector

Q: And I’m guessing that also puts a strain and causes morale issues as well being in that type of situation so frequently. Is that fair? 

A: So I think it’s sort of a double‑sided thing.  

So I believe for the people that are doing the rescues, the majority of the rescues, like BORSTAR, those are all volunteers. I would suspect if you were to talk to BORSTAR agents, they would tell you they live for that. They live to go out and rescue people and potentially risk their lives doing that.  

I think that the challenge is when agents are performing duties that they don’t feel are part of the border security mission, that’s where it becomes potentially a morale issue.  

I believe most agents would say that the humanitarian part, when it comes to a rescue like that, like an emergency rescue, they absolutely would say they’re patrolling the border, that’s happening on the border, that’s my responsibility to deal with.  

It’s the other stuff, the detention stuff, the care and feeding, that sort of thing, that agents generally have the feelings about that is detrimental to morale. 
 
Chief Patrol Agent John Modlin, Tucson Sector 

Q: Chief, other chief patrol agents have stated to this committee that, in their respective opinions, their agents prefer operating in the field as opposed to processing individuals.  Would you agree with that statement?  

A: Yes, I would agree that, you know, that the overwhelming majority of agents want to be out in the field. That’s why they became Border Patrol agents.  
 
Chief Patrol Agent Anthony “Scott” Good, El Paso Sector 

Q: How many daily Border Patrol agents are assigned to the processing center? 

A: It’s about 12 percent of our Border Patrol agent workforce currently. 

Q: Are they assigned per shift or is somebody just assigned to the processing center? 

A: There are times when we detail on a daily basis. Currently, we have a detail that’s a longer term detail at the soft‑sided facility, hard‑ and soft‑sided facility.  

Q: Okay. So generally speaking, at any point in time, it’s about 12 percent of the workforce that’s— 

A: Since I’ve been there, yes.

Q: Okay. And so that’s 12 percent of about 2,000? 

A: Yes. 

Q: And you mentioned that other— 

A: Twelve percent of the Border Patrol agents. So that’s about—because when I say 2,029, or whatever that number was, 2,000‑plus agents, right, that includes managers and other positions that aren’t a Border Patrol agent, field—

Q: Line agent?  

A: —line agent. And so that number is a little over 1,600. So 12 percent of that number. 

Q: Of 1,600.  

And then you mentioned that other details from other agencies typically help with processing and transportation. So they’re working within those processing centers too? 

A: Yes.  
 
Chief Patrol Agent Anthony “Scott” Good, El Paso Sector 

Q: Can you speak to or give us a sense of what percentage of the Border Patrol workforce in your sector is dedicated to processing activities currently? 

A: Currently, around 12 percent of the Border Patrol field agents. 

Q: Okay. And is it fair to say that processing, care and custody, those kinds of activities, have always been a part of a Border Patrol agent’s job to one extent or another, since you’ve been in Border Patrol? 

A: Since I’ve been in Border Patrol, not on the scale that we see now, but processing has been a function that Border Patrol agents have performed.
 
Chief Patrol Agent Gloria Chavez, Rio Grande Valley Sector

Q: Do you know what kind of impact, or was it a similar impact just on logistics that that surge had on RGV? 

A: So, when we have the surges, it’s pretty typical. The logistics, the personnel, the impacts are very similar. The one thing I think that we are doing quite well in RGV right now is that we’re still maintaining a semblance of enforcement assignments for our agents. It’s between 52 to 64 percent that we try to keep our agents on the front line doing patrol work versus the processing and nonenforcement details.  

But surges, when they happen, logistically, they absorb—they absorb resources, right?  So it’s pretty similar with one to the other.  

Q: So more agents that are doing processing, less front line during those surges? 

A: For the most part.  

Q: What kind of impact does that have on agents’ morale? 

A: It has a significant impact. I think agents, for the most part, want to be on patrol. They want to do the mission of border security. To us, it’s a concern everything that happens between those ports of entry.  
 
Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Dustin Caudle, Yuma Sector 

Q: What kind of difference did you experience in the Yuma Sector from the El Centro Sector? 

A: Yuma Sector had a significantly higher daily encounter rate. Obviously, El Centro did not have a centralized processing center, you know, like the soft‑sided facilities.  

So Yuma did, and so they had capacity issues almost every day. They were overwhelmed with transportation duties. They were overwhelmed with processing duties. There was multiple support requests to get detailed personnel in there to assist with that. A large percentage of the Border Patrol agents were pulled off of their line functions and performing administrative or processing duties rather than performing that frontline law enforcement mission.
 
Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Dustin Caudle, Yuma Sector 

Q: I’m going to move on to some of the encounter trends that you see in Yuma.  

In January 2021, Yuma was experiencing about 1,624 encounters a month, and just one year later, Yuma had well over 20,000 monthly encounters. Do you know—I know that you didn’t get to Yuma until August 2022, but do you know what kind of impact that had on operations in Yuma? Were you briefed on that? 

A: Yes. I was fairly aware of the impact and, again, there’s duties that have to be performed, and when you have that type of volume, which is overwhelming for any law enforcement agency, it has an impact to operations because operations have to be shifted into a humanitarian‑type mission in order to protect vulnerable populations, in order to perform transport duties, in order to complete that processing to ensure that overcrowding capacity issues are kept at a minimum.

So operations will suffer. Operation will be impacted. They will be lessened in order to do that other humanitarian mission.
 
Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Dustin Caudle, Yuma Sector 

Q: And about what percentage of the Border Patrol agents in the Yuma Sector are dedicated to processing or are on the front lines? 

A: So currently assigned to the CPC, mainly doing the processing duties and other functions that are just required inside the CPC, about 20 percent of my manpower is assigned to the CPC. It’s an absolutely massive facility.  
 
AGENTS DIVERTED FROM OTHER SECTORS TO PROCESS ILLEGAL ALIENS
 
Chief Patrol Agent Aaron Heitke, San Diego Sector 

Q: Did you have to receive people from other sectors to process them? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Which sectors? 

A: Yuma Sector, El Paso Sector, and Rio Grande Valley Sector. 
 
Chief Patrol Agent Jason Owens, Del Rio Sector 

Q: Did you get agents detailed into your sector to help with or have you had other agents from other sectors detailed to you to help?

A: Yes. So we had people detailed in, and we call that TDY, temporary duty. So they’re being detailed away from their permanent station. And that, of course, comes at the expense of what they’re supposed to be doing at their station.

Q: Have you gotten anyone from the northern border? 

A: We did. 

Q: How many do you think you got from the northern border? 

A: It varied from month to month. But I think at our highest, maybe 75 at a time.
 
Chief Patrol Agent John Modlin, Tucson Sector 

Q: Does removing agents from other sectors to detail them to Tucson, does that increase the likelihood of gotaways in other sectors? 

A: So what I can tell you is about 6 months maybe to a year ago we were sending about 50 agents at a time out to I believe Del Rio, between Del Rio and RGV, and certainly that affected our level of border security. So I would assume it would have the same impact to other sectors.

Q: And is that a concern to you? 

A: Yes, absolutely.

ATTORNEY GENERAL KEN PAXTON REFUSES BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S DEMAND TO SURRENDER SHELBY PARK AND END BORDER SECURITY MEASURES
January 26, 2024 | Press Release
Attor­ney Gen­er­al Ken Pax­ton Refus­es Biden Administration’s Demand to Sur­ren­der Shel­by Park and End Bor­der Secu­ri­ty Measures
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton responded in a letter today denying demands made by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), explaining that Texas will continue securing the border. Additionally, Attorney General Paxton made a list of counter-demands, requesting the federal agency release certain documents and precise information relating to their alleged authority. 
On January 11, the Texas Military Department secured Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, Texas, to protect the public and reinforce border security measures deterring an ongoing invasion. Inexplicably, DHS alleged that such law enforcement actions were unlawful and demanded that Texas “cease and desist” its activities to secure the park. On January 17, Attorney General Paxton rejected DHS’s claims, detailing how the agency misstated “both the facts and the law.” DHS then sent another letter, demanding that Texas tear down all obstructions on the property, open the border to illegal aliens, and surrender Shelby Park. 
Today, Attorney General Paxton has denied the Biden Administration’s unfounded requests and issued counter-demands. By February 15, DHS must supply the official plat maps and deeds demonstrating the precise parcels to which they claim ownership, an explanation of how Texas is preventing access to those specific parcels, documentation showing that Eagle Pass or Texas ever granted permission for DHS to erect infrastructure that interferes with border security, and proof of Congress empowering DHS to turn a Texas park into an unofficial and illegal port of entry. If the federal government is going to make such claims, it must provide proof. 
“Presumably because you have no meaningful response to our letter, your latest letter abandons earlier factual assertions, asserts new ones, and supplies even less of a legal basis for your demand. Once again, I respectfully suggest that any time you might spend suing Texas should be redirected toward enforcing the immigration laws Congress already has on the books,” Attorney General Paxton told DHS. “As I said before, this office will continue to defend Texas’s efforts to protect its southern border against every effort by the Biden Administration to undermine the State’s constitutional right of self-defense.”

Schengen Area
Temporary Reintroduction of Border Control
Temporary Reintroduction of Border Control
The Schengen Borders Code (SBC) provides Member States with the capability of temporarily reintroducing border control at the internal borders in the event of a serious threat to public policy or internal security.
The reintroduction of border control at the internal borders must be applied as a last resort measure, in exceptional situations, and must respect the principle of proportionality.
The duration of such a temporary reintroduction of border control at the internal borders is limited in time, depending on the legal basis invoked by the Member State introducing such border control.
The scope and duration of reintroduced border control should be restricted to the bare minimum needed to respond to the threat in question. Reintroducing border control at the internal border should only be used as a measure of last resort.
The reintroduction of border control is a prerogative of the Member States. The Commission may issue an opinion regarding the necessity of the measure and its proportionality but cannot veto a Member State’s decision to reintroduce border control.

For foreseeable events (e.g. sports events), the duration of the border control is limited to 30 days or for the foreseeable duration of the threat, if it exceeds 30 days.
If required, the reintroduction of border control can be prolonged for renewable periods of up to 30 days. The total period shall not exceed 6 months.
The Member State shall notify the Commission and other Member States at least 4 weeks before the planned reintroduction of border control. An exception of this notification period is made, if the circumstances giving rise to reintroduced border control become known at a shorter notice.
Cases requiring immediate action (Article 28 of the codified SBC)
Where immediate action needs to be taken to adequately respond to a threat, a Member State may reintroduce border control for 10 days without prior notification.
The Commission and the Member States must be informed of such decisions immediately.
While the reintroduction can be prolonged for periods of up to 20 days, the overall period of border control shall not exceed 2 months.
Cases where exceptional circumstances put the overall functioning of the Schengen area at risk (Article 29 of the codified SBC)
In exceptional circumstances, where the overall functioning of the Schengen Area is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external border control, and insofar as those circumstances constitute a serious threat to public policy or internal security, the Council may, based on a proposal from the Commission, recommend that one or more Member States decide to reintroduce border control at all or at specific parts of their internal borders.
Such a recommendation shall only be made as a last resort and as a measure to protect the common interests within the Schengen Area, where all other measures, in particular those referred to in Article 21 of the Schengen Borders Code, are ineffective in mitigating the serious threat identified.

Along U.S. Borders
The United States Border Patrol is the mobile, uniformed law enforcement arm of U.S. Customs and Border Protection within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for securing U.S. borders between ports of entry. The Border Patrol was officially established on May 28, 1924 by an act of Congress passed in response to increasing illegal immigration. As mandated by this Act, the small border guard in what was then the Bureau of Immigration was reorganized into the Border Patrol. The initial force of 450 officers was given the responsibility of combating illegal entries and the growing business of human smuggling.
  Mission
Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the focus of the Border Patrol has changed to detection, apprehension and/or deterrence of terrorists and terrorist weapons. Although the Border Patrol has changed dramatically since its inception in 1924, its overall mission remains unchanged: to detect and prevent the illegal entry of individuals into the United States. Together with other law enforcement officers, the Border Patrol helps maintain borders that work, facilitating the flow of legal immigration and goods while preventing the illegal trafficking of people and contraband.
Border Patrol Agent on Horseback.
The Border Patrol is specifically responsible for patrolling the 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico. Agents work around the clock on assignments, in all types of terrain and weather conditions. Agents also work in many isolated communities throughout the United States.
  Daily Duties
One of the most important activities of a Border Patrol agent is line watch. This involves the detection, prevention and apprehension of terrorists, undocumented individuals and human smugglers at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position, following up leads, responding to electronic sensor television systems, aircraft sightings, and interpreting and following tracks, marks and other physical evidence. Some of the major activities are traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.
  Training
Border Patrol Agent stands next to border patrol vehicle at checkpoint.
As one of the most rigorous and demanding law enforcement training programs in the country, U.S. Border Patrol training has become the envy of the federal law enforcement community. All newly hired Border Patrol Agent Trainees are required to complete a 117-day basic training program which includes instruction in Law, Operations, Spanish, Driver Training, Physical Techniques, and Firearms. Scenario-Based Training plays a significant role in the trainees' development as it allows them to apply the theoretical information in life like situations. The U.S. Border Patrol Academy is located in Artesia, NM. While in training, all trainees receive full pay and benefits.
Federal Law Enforcement Center (FLETC) courses are: Communications, Ethics and Conduct, Report Writing, Introduction to Computers, Fingerprinting, and Constitutional Law. The U.S. Border Patrol Academy is located in Artesia, NM.
  History
The U.S. Border Patrol has a long and rich history of helping to secure and protect the American way of life.

Fact Sheet: The Biden-Harris Administration Takes New Actions to Increase Border Enforcement and Accelerate Processing for Work Authorizations, While Continuing to Call on Congress to Act
Release Date: September 20, 2023
WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is announcing another series of actions to increase enforcement across the Southwest Border, accelerate processing of work authorizations, and the decision to redesignate and extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela. In consultation with interagency partners and with careful consideration for the conditions, and due to extraordinary and temporary conditions in Venezuela that prevent individuals from safely returning, the Secretary of Homeland Security decided to extend and redesignate TPS for Venezuela.

President Biden has called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform since his first day in office. As a result of Congress’ failure to enact the reform, the Administration has been using the limited tools it has available to secure the border and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system while leading the largest expansion of lawful pathways for immigration in decades. We also urge passage of fully funded emergency appropriations, including the supplemental funding request for border security, as requested by the President this summer. The $4 billion supplemental funding requested for DHS addresses immediate needs of the Department to safely and humanely manage the Southwest Border and to continue implementing our immigration laws through the expansion of lawful pathways and enforcing consequences for those who do not use them. DHS has also allocated more than $770 million to 69 partner organizations in Fiscal Year 2023 to support communities receiving migrants, in both the Southwest Border region and the interior, through the Shelter and Services Program (SSP) and the Emergency Food and Shelter Program – Humanitarian Awards (EFSP-H).

DHS continues to escalate the fight against those smuggling in persons and narcotics and the Administration is prosecuting an increasing number of smugglers, as well as noncitizens who are violating our laws.

FACT SHEET: White House Calls on Congress to Advance Critical National Security Priorities
HOME
BRIEFING ROOM
STATEMENTS AND RELEASES
Today, the President is requesting supplemental funding from Congress that advances our national security and supports our allies and partners. Since the horrific terrorist attack by Hamas, President Biden has surged security, intelligence, and diplomatic support to the people of Israel. This supplemental request will continue to provide the necessary security assistance to Israel, support Israeli efforts to secure the release of hostages, and extend humanitarian assistance to civilians impacted by the war in Israel and in Gaza.

The United States’ support to Israel comes at the same time that Vladimir Putin’s illegal war against the people of Ukraine passes its 600th day. The actions of the Biden-Harris Administration have enabled the people of Ukraine to defend their nation against a brutal and unprovoked invasion and recapture territory seized by Russian forces, liberating Ukrainian civilians from Russian occupation. The Administration’s supplemental request will provide the critical training, equipment, and weapons necessary to help Ukraine defend and recapture its sovereign territory and protect the Ukrainian people against Russian aggression.

The Administration’s supplemental invests in our military industrial base to ensure our military readiness, including replenishing resources to meet our defense needs as we support Israel and Ukraine, as well as the growing security requirements in the Indo-Pacific. Resources for the American defense industrial base will support American jobs, increase our nation’s ability to produce critically important munitions and other equipment, and ensure our Military continues to be the most ready, capable, and best equipped fighting force the world has ever seen. The Administration’s supplemental also requests increased support to allies and partners in our strategic competition with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). It will mobilize hundreds of billions from international finance institutions to provide a sustainable source of financing to developing countries as an alternative to the coercive lending practices of the PRC.

Additionally, we’ve been clear that the Congressional Republicans need to stop playing political games with border security and provide the resources our law enforcement personnel need to secure the southwest border and stop the flow of fentanyl into our country. President Biden continues to implement a regional migration strategy focused on enforcement, deterrence, and diplomacy. While progress has been made, President Biden has made clear that we need more funding to enhance our enforcement measures.

To advance our critical national security interests, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to provide additional national security resources that will:
Support Israel’s Defense Against Terrorism

Immediately following the brutal October 7 terrorist attack in Israel, President Biden directed his Administration to take swift and decisive action to ensure the government of Israel has everything it needs to defend itself consistent with the rule of law and the law of war. To build on that support, today the Administration is requesting funding to aid Israel’s defense against these horrific terrorist attacks. This request includes funds to:
Strengthen Israel’s defense from vicious terrorist attacks and bolster the Israeli Defense Forces through Department of Defense (DOD) assistance.
Ensure Israel’s air and missile defense systems’ readiness with support for the Government of Israel’s procurement of Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defense systems and components, and development of Iron Beam.
Replenish DOD stocks that are being drawn down to support Israel in its time of need.
Strengthen Israel’s military and enhance U.S. embassy security with foreign military financing from the Department of State.
Defend Ukraine Against Russian Aggression
Previous supplemental appropriations for direct military aid, economic and humanitarian assistance, and other support for Ukraine have been committed or nearly committed. As Ukrainians wage a tough counteroffensive and as winter approaches, the world is watching what Congress does next. The Administration’s request will provide funding for:
Additional weapons and equipment to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield and protect its people against Russian attacks, as well as replenish DOD stocks provided to Ukraine via Presidential drawdown authority. The weapons and equipment the United States has provided to date include air defense systems, munitions, small arms, ground maneuver units, and other key capabilities that have made a significant difference on the battlefield, helping Ukraine save countless lives and win the battles for Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson.
Continued military, intelligence, and other defense support, including robust investments in the defense industrial base, transportation costs of U.S. personnel and equipment, and continuing an enhanced U.S. troop presence in Europe among other critical support activities, in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine.
Critical economic and civilian security assistance, including direct budget support to help Ukraine continue to provide critical services to its people and sustain its economy while under attack; assistance for investments in critical infrastructure; support for civilian law enforcement; and assistance for demining in territory recently liberated from Russian occupation.
Support for Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s war and provided safety and shelter in the United States through Uniting for Ukraine.
Nuclear and radiological crisis management, response, and partner capacity building in case of emergencies as part of our general contingency planning.
Provide Life-Saving Humanitarian Assistance

In addition to funding for security assistance for Ukraine and Israel, we are also requesting funding to address humanitarian needs of innocent civilians, including those impacted by the war in Israel and in Gaza. Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine also continues to have a global impact, particularly on food security, given Ukraine’s role as the leading grain producer in the world, and this humanitarian assistance will address global needs. Our humanitarian assistance is critical to demonstrating U.S. leadership amid unprecedented levels of humanitarian need, geopolitical competition, and global challenges. This request includes funds to:
Provide life-saving humanitarian assistance and support for innocent civilians devastated by Putin’s unjust war in Ukraine, Hamas’ attack on Israel, and the numerous other natural and man-made crises around the world. This includes life-saving humanitarian assistance in Gaza and support for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and surrounding areas
Strengthen Security in the Indo-Pacific
It is critically important that we not lose our focus on the importance of integrated deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. Our allies and partners in the region need our support more than ever, and this request provides resources to help them build the capabilities necessary to meet emerging challenges. This request will provide funding for:
Security assistance for capacity building to address ongoing and emerging threats to critical allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific. This funding will bolster deterrence and support key allies and partners as they face an increasingly assertive PRC, and will support partners transitioning off of Russian military equipment.
The United States’ Submarine Industrial Base, through improvements and infrastructure work at the Navy’s four public shipyards and increasing production rates and submarine availability through initiatives in supplier development, shipbuilder and supplier infrastructure, workforce development, technology advancements, government oversight, and strategic sourcing. This funding will accelerate build and sustainment rates for attack submarines, one of our most effective capabilities for maintaining deterrence, in order to meet U.S. military requirements.  
AUKUS. While this funding for our submarine industrial base is necessary to meet U.S. national needs, these investments will also support U.S. commitments under AUKUS – our trilateral security partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom – the first major deliverable of which was our historic decision to support Australia acquiring conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Australia has also committed to provide a proportionate financial investment in the U.S. submarine industrial base to accelerate the delivery of Virginia class submarines.
Ensure Military Readiness

As we support our partners in Israel, Ukraine, and across the Indo-Pacific, the Administration’s request –including the items described above – provides funding to ensure American military readiness by investing over $50 billionin the American defense industrial base with through replenishment funding and other forms of security assistance, like foreign military financing and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. Resources for the American defense industrial base will support American jobs, increase our nation’s ability to produce critically important munitions and other equipment, and ensure our Military continues to be the most ready, capable, and best equipped fighting force the world has ever seen. Without additional replenishment funding, DOD will be unable to continue to backfill the Military Services for equipment provided via drawdown to Ukraine and Israel, thereby degrading U.S. readiness.

Provide Alternatives to Coercive PRC Financing in Developing Countries

To provide a credible alternative to the People’s Republic of China’s coercive and unsustainable financing for developing countries around the world, the Administration’s request will advance high-leverage solutions through the international financial institutions. This historic U.S. action will support the mobilization of $200 billion of new financing for developing countries backed by our partners and allies. The requested funding will:
Materially expand development finance to the countries hard hit by the spillovers of Russia’s war through funding for the World Bank.
Unlock up to $21 billion in new transparent lending with no additional appropriations through the authorization to lend to two International Monetary Fund (IMF) trust funds.
Additionally, we are seeking authorization to ensure the IMF can respond quickly to future global financial shocks and restore stability to both economies and markets, minimizing negative spillovers that could affect the U.S. economy, by providing the authority to extend our participation in the IMF’s New Arrangements to Borrow mechanism.

Strengthen Border Security and Enforcement

The Administration is asking Congress to provide the resources our law enforcement personnel need to secure the southwest border and stop the flow of fentanyl into our country. President Biden continues to implement a regional migration strategy focused on enforcement, diplomacy, and legal pathways and work authorization. The plan has resulted in the largest expansion of legal pathways in decades, increased the number of law enforcement personnel along the border and expedited removals of unlawful crossings thanks to historic diplomatic agreements. Despite the progress made, President Biden has made clear that we need more funding to execute on our three-part strategy, including enhancing our enforcement measures. The requested funding supports:
An additional 1,300 border patrol agents to work alongside the 20,200 agents already funded in the FY2024 Budget.
Funding to deploy over 100 cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our southwest border ports of entry.
Additional 1,000 law enforcement personnel and investigative capabilities to prevent cartels from moving fentanyl into the country.
1,600 additional asylum officers to increase by 2.5 times the number of personnel that interview and adjudicate claims for asylum and facilitate timely decisions so that those who are ineligible can be quickly removed and those with valid claims can have faster resolution.
375 new immigration judge teams, the largest incremental request ever, to adjudicate and process immigration cases more quickly and help reduce the caseload backlog.
Additional grants to local governments and non-profits to support the provision of for temporary food, shelter, and other services for those recently released from DHS custody.
Critical border management activities, including additional temporary holding facilities and detention beds for fair and fast processing for recent arrivals.
Expansion of lawful pathways, including efforts to streamline the processing of eligible refugees and migrants through the Safe Mobility Offices Initiative.
Support for eligible arrivals, including services to successfully resettle in the United States and become self-sufficient.
Funding to conduct robust child labor investigations and enforcement, particularly to protect vulnerable migrant children entering the United States through the southern border.
Reimbursement to the Department of Defense for its support provided along the southwest border in FY 2024.
Finally, our nation faces additional urgent needs for millions of hard-working Americans. In coming days, the Administration will also submit a request for supplemental funds to address recent natural disasters, avoid the risk that millions of Americans lose access to affordable high-speed internet or child care, provide additional resources for FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, and avert a funding cliff for wildland firefighter pay. Congress should also address critical funding needs the Administration communicated earlier this fall, including to protect critical nutrition assistance for millions of pregnant women, infants, and children through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Governor Chris Sununu Announces Northern Border Alliance Task Force
Concord, NH – Governor Christopher T. Sununu, Attorney General John M. Formella, and New Hampshire Department of Safety Commissioner Robert L. Quinn announce today the establishment of the Northern Border Alliance Task Force composed of state, county, and local law enforcement officers. The Task Force will conduct patrols along the northern border to: reduce the instance of crimes and illicit activity; respond to all threats, all crimes, all hazards; and collect, share, and act upon criminal intelligence. The Task Force will also cooperate, as needed, with federal law enforcement officers in the enforcement of federal criminal immigration laws.  
The Northern Border Alliance Task Force will be funded by the Department of Safety, in accordance with RSA 21-P:69 & 70, which has $1,435,384 grant funds available to the New Hampshire State Police, Forest Rangers, and Fish and Game Department, as well as to county and local law enforcement agencies to fund patrols within 25 air miles from the Canadian border.
“The Federal Government refuses to take action on our Northern Border,” said Governor Chris Sununu. “They cut funding, limited our resources, and have thrown their hands up. Without adequate federal support, the state is stepping up. Encounters with individuals on the terrorist watch list at the Land Border Ports of Entry along the northern border have doubled since 2017. This is a stark contrast to what we are seeing on the southern border, where Land Border Port of Entry encounters have decreased during that same time period. In fact, just this year, 85% of all land border encounters with individuals on the terrorist watchlist occurred on the northern border – while only 15% occurred on the southern border. In meeting with local law enforcement up north, it is clear we need more targeted resources.”
“Our aim is to increase the presence and effectiveness of law enforcement in northern New Hampshire, particularly in communities in close proximity to the Canadian border. Given the rural nature, expansive geography, and sparse population of northern Coos County, local law enforcement resources are extremely limited,” said Attorney General Formella. “The increase in personnel provided by the Northern Border Alliance Program and Task Force will add ten thousand patrol hours near the border through June 30, 2025. This will shorten response times to calls for service in the region, increase the effectiveness of crime detection and prevention in a remote area of the State, and enhance border security efforts.”
All law enforcement officers conducting activities, patrols and investigations for the Northern Border Alliance Task Force shall serve under the general supervision and control of the Attorney General’s Office pursuant to a memo issued today by the Attorney General. 
Participating law enforcement officers will be vested with the authority and jurisdiction, within twenty-five air miles from the Canadian border, to: (1) enforce all state criminal laws, and (2) cooperate with federal law enforcement officers in preventing and detecting crime and apprehending criminals, including those who have committed federal immigration-related crimes. RSA 21-M:3-b; RSA 106-B:11; 8 U.S.C. § 1357 (g) (10).  In addition, because the participating officers will be working as part of an Attorney General task force, local and county officers who participate in the task force will be entitled to the same legal advice and protections afforded to State officials. 
In order to become a member of the Northern Border Alliance Task Force and participate in a Northern Border Alliance patrol, law enforcement officers must be employed by a state, local, or county law enforcement agency and participate in training jointly conducted by the Attorney General’s Office and the New Hampshire Division of State Police. Eligible law enforcement officers must receive approval from the chief law enforcement officer of the agency in which he or she works, receive a written designation from the Attorney General’s Office, execute a written agreement in a form to be established by the Attorney General’s Office, and comply with all applicable policies established by either the New Hampshire Division of State Police or the Attorney General’s Office.
The first phase of the Northern Border Alliance Task Force will begin immediately with participation from State Police. The second phase will begin when the rules for the Northern Border Alliance Program become effective, which is expected to occur at the November 16, 2023 meeting of the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules. Once these rules are approved, local and county law enforcement agencies will be permitted to apply for funding from the Northern Border Alliance Program and execute grant agreements with the State. When those grant agreements are approved, local and county law enforcement officers will begin their participation with the Northern Border Alliance Task Force.

Border Security
Securing and managing our borders have been priority mission areas for DHS since its creation The United States shares 7,500 miles of land border with Canada and Mexico, as well as rivers, lakes and coastal waters along both borders. 
In addition, our international airports receive international flights, serving as the primary entry point into the United States for large volumes of travelers and commercial goods. Land, sea, and air borders are important economic gateways that account for trillions of dollars in trade and travel each year and are found in many of our nation’s largest cities and are integral parts of many American communities. 
Protecting our borders from the illicit movement of weapons, drugs, contraband, and people, while promoting lawful entry and exit, and lawful trade, is essential to homeland security, economic prosperity, and national sovereignty. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a DHS component, is one of the world's largest law enforcement organizations and the United States’ first unified border agency. CBP applies a comprehensive approach to border management and control, combining customs, immigration, border security, and agricultural protection into one coordinated and supportive activity.  
Other component agencies like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard protect our borders from the illicit movement of weapons, drugs, contraband, and people, while promoting lawful entry and exit, and lawful trade, is essential to homeland security, economic prosperity, and national sovereignty. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provides support for processing and provides resources to local governments.  
In February 2022, Secretary Mayorkas announced the creation of the Southwest Border Coordination Center (SBCC), which leads the planning and coordinating of a whole-of-government response to the anticipated increase in border encounters.

Border Crisis: CBP’s Response
Faced with an unprecedented number of families arriving at the southwest border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection resolved to maintain a secure border in the midst of a humanitarian and national security border crisis

By the hundreds of thousands, Central American families and children without their parents migrated to the southwest border. They were pushed by the threat of violence and by economic hardships. They were pulled in by the chance at a good job in a booming U.S. economy. They were lured by smugglers dangling a false promise that if they bring their children, they will get to stay in the U.S.
Between October 2018 and September (the U.S. government’s fiscal year), CBP law enforcement personnel apprehended or have deemed inadmissible nearly a million illegal immigrants crossing the southwest border, the most in nearly 15 years.
CBP had to address the humanitarian crisis while enforcing hundreds of laws and regulations, keeping Americans safe by intercepting dangerous drugs and criminals crossing the border, and facilitating legitimate trade and travel at 328 U.S. ports of entry.
“McAllen [Texas] was hit really, really hard,” said Ben Stern, a supervisory Border Patrol agent from Maine, one of hundreds of agents and officers deployed to address the crisis. One of his assignments was to help process illegal aliens after they were apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the area with the highest number of apprehensions in FY 2019. At the height of apprehensions in May, the entire Rio Grande Valley Sector averaged more than 1,600 each day, compared to just 560 a day in May 2018. “Our role was as a holding facility until they could be transported elsewhere for processing [by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Health and Human Services facilities]. It was pretty chaotic at times.”

In previous decades, the U.S. government built Border Patrol stations on the Southwest border for agents to quickly process and remove adult males from Mexico, which was the predominant demographic apprehended by agents. In 2019, agents apprehended mostly families and unaccompanied children from Central America, a demographic that pushed stations over capacity do to requirements for children in custody.
The U.S. government’s inability to remove these populations were due to several factors including a recent court-imposed, 20-day limit on the government’s authority maintain custody of children. With no other options to facilitate immigration proceedings while in custody, CBP had to release families and provide notices to appear before an immigration court at a future date. With the help of smugglers, news quickly spread throughout Central America that if you cross the border with a child, you can stay in the U.S for good.

incidents in one day in February. Of those rescued during these attempts to
cross the Rio Grande, 16 were from Honduras (including six children ranging
in age from 1 to 17 years old) and one Guatemalan child, age 3. CBP photo
“Nationwide, CBP’s apprehensions for [fiscal year] 2019 totaled 1,148,000, more than 970,000 along the Southwest Border alone,” CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said in an Oct. 29 news conference in El Paso, Texas. “This is a staggering 88% higher than the fiscal year 2018. These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even this country.”
Additionally, the Border Patrol estimates that more than 150,000 individuals successfully evaded capture and disappeared into border communities in FY 2019.
“Border security is national security — there is no difference — and the crisis on our southwest border puts our national security at risk,” U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost told a House subcommittee dealing with Homeland Security, June 20.
The more than 970,000 illegal aliens trying to enter the country illegally along the southwest border in the last year is nearly twice the amount in the same period a year earlier.

In some sectors, the U.S. Border Patrol diverted up to 60% of its agents from the border security mission to care for families and children, significantly reducing agents’ presence on the border.
“On a daily basis, agents are feeding and caring for migrants, consoling children, and rescuing over 4,000 aliens that smugglers have placed into peril,” Brian Hastings, chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol told the House Judiciary Committee July 25. “They continue to perform the humanitarian mission, knowing they are sacrificing the border security mission they were hired to do, day after day, with no end in sight.”
The crisis depleted ICE’s detention capacity and greatly overwhelmed its resources. That caused the Border Patrol to hold migrants in overcrowded conditions rather than moving them to ICE’s facilities designed for longer-term custody. Without this outlet, the Border Patrol was compelled to hold detainees much longer than it should.
In fact, holding 4,000 people in custody at one time is a crisis. At its height, the agency had nearly 20,000 in custody.
 “Our Border Patrol facilities … were not designed to hold families or children,” Acting Commissioner Morgan said in another news conference earlier in October. “They were designed as police stations. And because of that, because of the new demographic of families and children, those resources became strained, and our limited resources had to be diverted from their law enforcement duties, securing the border, to address the humanitarian crisis.  Make no mistake: Our country was less safe because of it.”
  Migration Factors
  Various media and government sources have identified a number of drivers for this unprecedented migration across the region. Push factors include violence, insecurity and famine in various parts of the Northern Triangle countries of Central America. Pull factors include a booming U.S. economy, outdated immigration laws on top of recent court rulings have created loopholes in the U.S. immigration enforcement system, and transnational smugglers who advertise easy admission to the United States as part of a multi-billion-dollar criminal enterprise.

aliens who try to cross the border. CBP photo
Central American migrants believed U.S. officials would admit them to the United States, if they crossed the border with a child. A recent court ruling limits families and children during immigration proceedings, and most were released into the United States within days. Meanwhile, the illegal aliens were allowed to stay while their asylum claims make it through the courts, a process so backlogged it lasts for years. It’s a fact not lost on the criminal organizations profiting off the exploitation of migrants.
“This perception about our immigration system incentivizes migrants to put their lives in the hands of smugglers and make the dangerous trek north to our southwest border,” Acting Commissioner Morgan wrote in remarks submitted to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on July 30.  “We see the cost of these pull and push factors every day in profits derived by transnational criminal organizations, in the lives lost along the journey, and in the flight of generations of youth from the countries of the Northern Triangle.”
Up to 60% of Border Patrol agents’ time was diverted to care for the humanitarian needs of the illegal aliens apprehended. Agents taking migrants to a hospital, for example, are not available to stop drug smugglers or other illegal crossings when large groups are encountered, Chief Patrol Agent Rodolfo Karisch, the sector chief in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in April.
 “The bad guys know this,” he said. “They know our resources are stretched thin in addressing the humanitarian issue, which undermines our border security operations. They direct the movement of large groups into certain border areas as a diversion to facilitate the smuggling of drugs.”
Even without such nefarious intentions, the large number of families challenged CBP’s ability to process and provide for those in custody.
“These families are not concerned with being caught by the Border Patrol; they are actually turning themselves in, knowing that they will be processed and released with a court date years in the future,” Brian Hastings, chief of the Border Patrol’s law enforcement operations Hastings said in written statement to a Senate committee in June. “Smugglers are exploiting these loopholes to encourage more migration. They openly advertise a safe and legal journey to the United States, misleading families by telling them there is a policy that anyone who arrives with a child will not be deported.”
In fact, Hastings’ statement said only 1.5% of family units from Central America caught in 2017 were sent back to their home countries, despite the fact that most will not end up having valid claims to remain in the U.S. This backlogged the system and gave credibility to the smugglers’ claim that families will not be deported.
  Taking Care of Illegal Aliens

To deal with the unprecedented number of migrants, especially family members, CBP stood up six temporary, steel-framed structures. The facilities in Donna, El Paso and Tornillo, Texas, and in Yuma, Arizona, are weatherproof, climate-controlled spaces that include a variety of services to accommodate the incoming migrants.
“The additional capacity of these critical structures provides much needed help during the crisis,” Border Patrol Division Chief Lloyd Easterling, who is responsible for the temporary facilities in Donna, Texas, said at the peak of the immigrant flows this summer. But he added those facilities filled up as soon as they were constructed. CBP stood up the first facility in May and doubled the holding space for family units with a second facility in June.

In addition to having a roof over their heads out of the summer heat, CBP provided hot meals and snacks, hygiene kits, medical services, transportation, sleeping mats, blankets, drinking water, diapers, wipes, baby formula and clothing sets.
“We are providing a humane solution to families, unaccompanied children and adults during this crisis. We are providing all the essential services and products,” said Rosie Zaragoza-Santos, a contracting specialist who works with the CBP office responsible for the timely buying and delivery of the supplies and services provided at each temporary structure. “We are addressing the humanitarian effort by issuing contracts that provide clean clothing, housing, food, medical care and showers for incoming migrants, while also supporting our agents at the frontline.”
Even with these improved structures, things can get tense for people in custody and those caring for them, but Stern said Border Patrol agents know how to diffuse tense situations. 
“You maintain your basic humanity and treat people how you want to be treated in a situation like this, while still upholding the law,"" he said. ""It has a welcome effect. When you show somebody you’re taking into custody that you can be respectful and decent and even friendly, in some cases, it makes your job easier and safer.”
Plus, Stern added, “Being a decent human being costs nothing.”
  Addressing the Crisis
  CBP responded to address the border crisis with determination to maintain a secure border and provide humanitarian care for those in custody. Stern is one of 325 Border Patrol agents and more than 700 CBP officers who were sent from their regular duty stations across the U.S. to the southwest border with Mexico. Before going to Texas, he spent a month in California, apprehending illegal aliens. Compared to his previous work apprehending border crossers, he said these migrants were much more compliant and turn themselves in. But the ratio of illegal aliens to agents is way out of proportion, especially at the holding facilities.
“You’re talking 800 versus eight or 10,” Stern said.
Now he’s working temporarily at CBP headquarters in Washington, D.C., providing valuable insight to what’s happening in the field locations.
“It’s a great opportunity to be here and provide what input I can to the decision makers,” Stern said.
CBP also sought and gained help from its partners at the Department of Defense, tapping into the military’s abilities to move large amounts of assets in a short time.

“In Operation Guardian Support, National Guard personnel are providing air support in the form of light and medium lift helicopters; infrastructure support, such as road maintenance and vegetation clearing; operational support, such as fleet maintenance and repair and law enforcement communications assistance; and surveillance support as surveillance camera operators,” Provost said in a statement submitted to a House committee in June. “Agents often work alone in rugged, remote areas. The surveillance DOD provides helps us keep the agents on the ground safe and aware of illegal activity happening along the border.”
Lawmakers approved $1.1 billion in emergency supplemental funding for CBP in late June, money that addressed humanitarian needs, border operations, and other related programs.
“The supplemental has provided much-needed resources for the care and processing of the record-breaking numbers of migrants illegally crossing our Southwest border,” Provost said, although she added that ICE also needs money to take custody of the illegal aliens and ease the demand on overwhelmed CBP resources. The Department of Health and Human Services also received nearly $3 billion, which significantly improved their ability to take custody of unaccompanied children.
DHS also implemented new Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), whereby certain foreign individuals entering or seeking admission to the U.S. from Mexico – illegally or without proper documentation – may be returned to Mexico and wait outside of the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings. The initiative effectively ended “catch and release.” As a result of MPP and stepped up enforcement efforts in Mexico, border apprehensions and inadmissible cases along the Southwest border declined dramatically for the last four months of the fiscal year.
New temporary holding facilities designed for families and children, additional CBP officers and Border Patrol agents deployed to the border, military support, money from Congress, and new agreements struck with Mexico and Central American countries to curb illegal immigration from flowing north all aligned to address the crisis. Numbers dropped from the high of nearly 145,000 apprehensions and those deemed inadmissible in May, to a four-month low of 52,000 by the last month of the fiscal year.
Although pleased with the results, Acting Commissioner Morgan remained guarded in his assessment of the border crisis.
“The daily [enforcement actions] in May were almost 6,000,” he said during the Oct. 29 news conference. “Today, it’s gone drastically down, but it’s still 1,400 apprehensions per day. That’s still at crisis levels. We’re not out of the woods yet.”
Border Patrol agents, such as Stern, say they will continue to focus on the mission.
“You go where you’re needed,” Stern said, noting that he has spent the better part of the year far from his home in Maine and, like many of his Border Patrol colleagues, faces a daunting task. “We continue to meet the challenge, and we’re working to take care of the migrants humanely while securing our border.”

“The supplemental has provided much-needed resources for the care and processing of the record-breaking numbers of migrants illegally crossing our Southwest border,” Provost said, although she added that ICE also needs money to take custody of the illegal aliens and ease the demand on overwhelmed CBP resources. The Department of Health and Human Services also received nearly $3 billion, which significantly improved their ability to take custody of unaccompanied children.
DHS also implemented new Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), whereby certain foreign individuals entering or seeking admission to the U.S. from Mexico – illegally or without proper documentation – may be returned to Mexico and wait outside of the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings. The initiative effectively ended “catch and release.” As a result of MPP and stepped up enforcement efforts in Mexico, border apprehensions and inadmissible cases along the Southwest border declined dramatically for the last four months of the fiscal year.
New temporary holding facilities designed for families and children, additional CBP officers and Border Patrol agents deployed to the border, military support, money from Congress, and new agreements struck with Mexico and Central American countries to curb illegal immigration from flowing north all aligned to address the crisis. Numbers dropped from the high of nearly 145,000 apprehensions and those deemed inadmissible in May, to a four-month low of 52,000 by the last month of the fiscal year.
Although pleased with the results, Acting Commissioner Morgan remained guarded in his assessment of the border crisis.
“The daily [enforcement actions] in May were almost 6,000,” he said during the Oct. 29 news conference. “Today, it’s gone drastically down, but it’s still 1,400 apprehensions per day. That’s still at crisis levels. We’re not out of the woods yet.”
Border Patrol agents, such as Stern, say they will continue to focus on the mission.
“You go where you’re needed,” Stern said, noting that he has spent the better part of the year far from his home in Maine and, like many of his Border Patrol colleagues, faces a daunting task. “We continue to meet the challenge, and we’re working to take care of the migrants humanely while securing our border.”

Fact Sheet
A Day in the Life of ERO
Divisions and Field Offices
To accomplish its mission, ERO is organized into several divisions:
Custody Management
The Custody Management Division provides policy and oversight of those in ICE custody and manages ICE detention operations:
Custody Programs develops and promotes best practices in civil detention and enforcement initiatives by providing policy support, facilitating the implementation of applicable ICE directives, and expanding ERO’s capacity to manage special populations.
Detention Management coordinates with the 25 ERO field offices to ensure a safe and secure environment for noncitizens in ICE custody through facility compliance, on-site monitoring, and the acquisition of detention facilities.
Enforcement
The Enforcement Division manages the enforcement initiatives and components through which ERO identifies and arrests noncitizens subject to removal from the U.S.:
The Criminal Apprehension Division performs strategic planning and establishes policies designed to enhance ICE’s ability to arrest and remove noncitizens from the United States.
Fugitive Operations facilitates logistical and operational support to 25 ERO field offices by developing, implementing, and overseeing plans and policies in support of the overall National Fugitive Operations Program mission.
Targeting Operations comprises three support centers, Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC), the National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center (NCATC), and the Pacific Enforcement Response Center (PERC). These centers apply technical capabilities, analytical tools, and law enforcement expertise to generate intelligence-driven leads on noncitizens subject to removal.
Field Operations
At ERO Headquarters (HQ), the Field Operations Division provides guidance to and coordination among ICE ERO’s 25 field offices across the nation:
Domestic Operations oversees, directs and coordinates all ERO Field Operations activities throughout the nation's field offices and sub-offices.
Special Operations oversees and coordinates ERO’s intelligence collection efforts, firearms training and protective equipment procurement, various tactical programs, and communications efforts. The division also oversees ERO operations that support the prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery plans for critical and significant incidents such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or other national emergencies or incidents.
ICE Health Service Corps
The ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) administers a detention health system that provides direct healthcare in ICE-owned facilities; oversees compliance with healthcare-related detention standards in contracted facilities; reimburses for off-site healthcare services that detained noncitizens receive; and supports special operations missions. IHSC also oversees non-IHSC facilities’ compliance with national detention standards and the coordination of off-site care through medical referrals.
WHAT WE DO: ICE HEALTH SERVICE CORPS
Law Enforcement Systems and Analysis
ERO’s Law Enforcement Systems and Analysis Division is responsible for helping inform the development of ERO strategies and supporting continuous enhancement of ERO business processes to execute those strategies. Through data collection, analysis and technology and process improvements, LESA delivers tools, studies and recommendations that assist ICE’s decision-making and planning. LESA studies ICE’s operations and resources — personnel, processes, technology and infrastructure — to find areas for continuous improvement.
Non-Detained Management
The Non-Detained Management Division provides guidance, coordination and operational direction to ERO’s 25 field offices regarding managing ICE’s non-detained docket, including the alternatives to detention (ATD) program, bond management, and juvenile and family residential matters.
Operations Support
Operations Support coordinates ERO requirements to provide the resources and support infrastructure necessary to ensure the efficient execution of ERO’s mission. The division’s responsibilities include the management of budget formulation and execution, finance, facilities construction and leasing, fleet and personal property, training, human capital, purchase card support, and compliance and oversight support.
Removal
The Removal Division coordinates, manages and facilitates efforts to successfully remove noncitizens from the United States. In collaboration with other ICE program offices and the Department of State, ERO also works with international partners to successfully execute removal operations:
ICE Air Operations provides commercial and chartered aviation support, both domestically and internationally, to all 25 ERO field offices throughout the United States. It also provides air transportation to transfer noncitizens to designated detention locations and/or to staging sites to accomplish removal flights to noncitizens’ countries of origin.
Removal Management coordinates the removals of noncitizens with ERO’s 25 field offices nationwide. This unit develops and implements strategies to remove noncitizens from the United States who are subject to removal by collaborating within the agency and with interagency stakeholders, foreign embassies and consulates, and international partners.
International Operations comprises ERO’s personnel based overseas and supports the 25 ERO field offices through regular and ongoing liaison with host-nation government officials in the coordination of removal operations.

MEDIA ADVISORY: HIGGINS, PFLUGER ANNOUNCE JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON HUMAN COST OF BIDEN AND MAYORKAS’ BORDER CRISIS
July 20, 2023
Committee to begin phase three of investigation into Secretary Mayorkas’ failure to secure the Southwest border
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Chairman Clay Higgins (R-LA) and Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence Chairman August Pfluger (R-TX) announced a hearing next Wednesday, July 26, at 2:00 PM ET to examine the tragic human cost of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and President Biden’s historic humanitarian border crisis. This hearing will launch the third phase of the House Committee on Homeland Security’s full-scale oversight investigation into Secretary Mayorkas’ dereliction of duty and the Biden administration’s failure to secure our borders.
 
“The egregious failures of Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden at our Southwest border have brought generational trauma upon our country, and the cost of this crisis has been paid with human lives. As this Committee has already established, cartels with zero regard for human life have seized operational control of the border. With this new power, they have taken a record number of lives with deadly fentanyl, abandoned countless numbers of trafficked women and children in devastating conditions, and perpetrated violence against law enforcement and landowners on the frontlines of the crisis,” Chairman Higgins said. “The disintegration of our nation’s sovereignty at our Southern border is unacceptable. Next week, Homeland Republicans will continue demanding answers on this DHS Secretary’s dereliction of duty and his failure to protect the American people.”
 
“The Biden administration’s failure to secure our borders is not only unacceptable but also deeply disheartening, as it results in deadly consequences for countless Americans, including individuals in my home state of Texas like the Tambunga family, who lost a beloved grandmother and daughter to a human smuggler earlier this year,” Chairman Pfluger said. “Secretary Mayorkas’ dereliction of duty puts our homeland security in jeopardy and reveals a concerning lack of urgency in addressing one of the worst border crises in our nation’s history.”
DETAILS:

WHAT: A joint hearing by the Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement and Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence entitled “The Real Cost of an Open Border: How Americans are Paying the Price.”

DATE: Wednesday, July 26, 2023

TIME: 2:00 PM ET

Bill Analysis: The Secure the Border Act of 2023
By Alexandra Villarreal | May 8, 2023
  On May 2, 2023, House Republicans introduced H.R.2, The Secure the Border Act of 2023. Sponsored by Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Florida), the expansive proposal represents an enforcement-only approach to migration-related challenges at the United States-Mexico border and beyond. It is a combination of three bills from the 118th Congress: The Border Security and Enforcement Act of 2023, the Orderly Requirements Designed to Enforce and Regulate Latin American Migration (ORDER) Act, and the Border Reinforcement Act of 2023.  
In practice, the bill package would severely restrict the right to seek asylum in the U.S., curtail other existing lawful pathways, place unnecessary pressure on border communities, intensify labor shortages faced by small businesses and essential industries, establish new criminal penalties, and make other significant changes to U.S. immigration law.  
This analysis details six major themes and concerns around H.R.2. While it is not intended to function as a comprehensive overview of the sweeping bill, it does underscore key takeaways.  
1. The Secure the Border Act of 2023 would restart border wall construction and defund NGOs that provide services to migrants  
The bill would increase funding for border barriers and enforcement personnel, while dismantling current practices that relieve pressure on U.S. border communities. In particular, it would:  
Reestablish Trump-era border policy, including restarting construction on the border wall and requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create a plan to meet benchmarks for 200 miles of construction each year;  
Reinforce the unrealistically narrow definition of “operational control” as “the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband”(emphasis added); 
Require the DHS secretary to incorporate physical barriers, infrastructures, and technologies to “achieve situational awareness and operational control” at the U.S.-Mexico border;  
Increase the number of full-time Border Patrol agents to at least 22,000; 
Prohibit the use of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations resources to transport noncitizens who will not be detained into the country’s interior;  
Build on Operation Stonegarden to appropriate $110 million per fiscal year — from 2024 through 2028 — for grants to law enforcement agencies working with U.S. immigration authorities near the U.S.’s land and maritime borders;  
Require the U.S. Border Patrol to pull together a strategic plan based in part on information provided by “border community stakeholders” such as hospitals, farmers, ranchers, property owners, victims of crimes done by undocumented immigrants, and others “negatively impacted by illegal immigration;” 
Pull funding for processing noncitizens who have entered the U.S. between ports of entry;  
Bar funds from being disbursed to NGOs that “facilitate[ ] or encourage[ ] unlawful activity,” defined to include unlawful entry, or that facilitate transportation, lodging, or immigration legal services for people who are inadmissible;  
Restrict the use of documents provided by DHS, such as notices to appear and work authorizations, as valid IDs at airport security checkpoints; 
Limit the CBP One phone application and other similar platforms to only be used for the inspection of perishable cargo, barring its use for the scheduling of immigration interviews for people at ports of entry;  
Mandate government reporting on migration-related economic and security ramifications to states and municipalities along the U.S.-Mexico border, including to law enforcement, school districts, healthcare providers, and farmers and ranchers; and 
Defund an alternatives to detention case management program and CBP’s shelter services program. 
While some elements of the proposed legislation might prove effective and helpful, like additional investments in personnel and technology at ports of entry, the bill’s enforcement-only focus and failure to address lawful pathways is deeply flawed. The bill’s overarching focus on physical barriers and deterrence measures — but not increased numbers of asylum officers or immigration judges — presents a vision of the U.S.’s southern border where people fleeing violence and persecution would be quickly removed, without meaningful access to protection. Further, by interpreting “operational control” through the circumscribed definition in the Secure Fence Act of 2006, the bill is predicated on an unrealistic standard that the U.S. must prevent all unauthorized crossings along a roughly 2,000-mile border.  
Meanwhile, H.R.2’s emphasis on keeping noncitizens detained — and defunding more humane approaches to case management for migrants and their families — could cause undue harm and trauma. A strategic plan for the Border Patrol predicated on information from those who have been “negatively impacted by illegal immigration” may have the adverse effect of demonizing migrants and asylum seekers, instead of promoting policies that recognize their human dignity. Provisions that limit migrants’ and asylum seekers’ ability to fly to their final destinations while they await their adjudications would make it harder for them to reach their friends and families, while also placing unnecessary pressure on border communities as longer-term hosts. And policies that would take away much-needed funding from NGOs for providing direct services to the world’s most vulnerable could further impede the U.S.’s ability to respond to the challenges we face on the ground at the border.
2.  The bill would significantly limit asylum in the U.S. 
H.R.2 would restrict both access to and eligibility for asylum. In particular, the bill would: 
Raise the initial screening standard so that a noncitizen would have to prove they were “more likely than not” to ultimately qualify for asylum in order to continue pursuing their protection claim and not be quickly removed from the U.S.;   
Ban the vast majority of asylum seekers from requesting protection at a U.S. border if they traveled through a third country en route to the U.S. and had not already been denied asylum there;   
Generally restrict asylum claims to only those migrants who arrive in the U.S. at an official port of entry;   
Add exclusions to asylum eligibility, including by enacting restrictions against those who unlawfully received a federal public benefit or could reasonably avoid persecution by relocating to a safer area within their home country;  
Deny employment authorization if an asylum seeker entered or tried to enter the U.S. at a place other than a port of entry;   
Impose a fee of not less than $50 to apply for asylum, which might make it harder to afford to make a protection claim;   
Narrow who qualifies for asylum based on their political opinion or membership in a particular social group, in ways that would curtail protection claims by generally excluding cases related to interpersonal violence, gang-related activity, or crime;  
Allow the DHS secretary to indefinitely suspend access to a land or maritime border for migrants who enter without admission or parole, misrepresent themselves to enter, or do not have valid documentation to enter, if doing so would help achieve “operational control;”   
Require the DHS secretary to expand detention capacity, including by potentially reopening detention facilities that have been closed or whose use has been altered during the Biden administration;   
Limit release from detention for asylum seekers with positive credible fear determinations, requiring immigration detention for the duration of their asylum adjudication process. With some cases taking multiple years, this provision would mean that some asylum seekers with credible claims could face lengthy periods of detention;  
Expand the use of programs modeled after the Trump administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), so that migrants are returned to Mexico or Canada pending their removal proceedings or reviews;  
Require the U.S. to negotiate an international agreement where the Mexican government would accept the continued presence of non-Mexican asylum seekers during their adjudications for asylum in the U.S., like under MPP; and  
Make other changes to current asylum procedures.   
These provisions would make it harder for individuals to request asylum, even in cases where they can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution, effectively disqualifying people who would be able to receive protection under the U.S.’s current laws. Taken together, the bill’s restrictions would severely limit asylum for most migrants who traveled through Latin America to reach the U.S.-Mexico border. The new fee requirements could box out asylum seekers without the ability to pay for refuge, while mandatory detention or long-term waits abroad could make it more difficult for migrants to access legal counsel and ultimately win their cases.  
Programs such as MPP would also represent a significant safety concern; well over a thousand migrants became victims of rape, murder, torture, kidnapping, and other attacks after the U.S. returned them to Mexican border towns under MPP.  
3. The bill would roll back safeguards for migrant children
The Flores Settlement Agreement is the current standard that governs the conditions under which children can legally be held in U.S. immigration detention. This bill would undermine some of the agreement’s most fundamental stipulations, including restrictions on how long kids can be detained, while also limiting access to an existing legal pathway for migrant children. In particular, the bill would:   
Explicitly end the existing presumption against detaining a noncitizen child accompanied by family, making it easier for families with minor children to be held in detention indefinitely;  
Require DHS to reestablish family detention, requiring that parents and children who entered together without authorization be held in immigration detention if the parent is charged with a misdemeanor for improper entry;   
State the sense of Congress that these amendments satisfy Flores Settlement Agreement requirements, which place strict limits on the detention of minor children;  
Disallow states from setting licensing requirements for immigration detention facilities holding children or families, even if the state law requires this certification;  
Amend the bipartisan William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to require the return of all unaccompanied migrant children — not just those from Mexico and Canada — to their countries of origin if they are not trafficking victims and do not express a fear of return;   
Fast-track removal proceedings for unaccompanied migrant children who may qualify for humanitarian relief, so that hearings take place within 14 days of an initial screening. The initial screenings would occur within 48 hours of apprehension;  
Extend the timeline to transfer unaccompanied migrant children to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from 72 hours to 30 days for those with humanitarian claims, and make the transfer of other unaccompanied migrant kids to HHS discretionary, significantly extending the time that migrant children could be held in border facilities that are not equipped to care for minors;  
Require HHS to provide DHS with identifying information about sponsors for unaccompanied children, including their social security numbers and immigration status, and then require DHS to place any unlawfully present sponsors in removal proceedings within 30 days; and  
Change eligibility for special immigrant juvenile status (SIJ) to only apply to youth who could not reunite with both of their parents because of abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis, instead of the current standard of youth who cannot reunite with one or both parents.  
In practice, these provisions would have significant consequences for children and families seeking safety in the U.S. Although requiring DHS to hold migrant kids and parents together would avoid Trump-era family separations like those resulting from the 2018 Zero Tolerance policy, practices promoting prolonged detention of children and families are likely to cause serious physical and mental health effects.   
Expedited processes and timelines for vulnerable children to be screened and returned to their countries of origin would limit access to counsel and meaningful adjudications, potentially returning some minors to dangerous situations in their home countries. Additionally, the bill’s mandatory removal proceedings against undocumented sponsors of migrant kids are designed to deter family members in the U.S. from coming forward to take in unaccompanied children, increasing the number of migrant kids in government shelters or placed with less familiar sponsors. Finally, by restricting eligibility for SIJ, H.R.2 would curb a current legal humanitarian pathway to a green card for vulnerable migrant youth. 
4. The bill would narrow the executive branch’s parole powers 
Under current law, the DHS secretary has the discretion to grant parole to individuals on a case-by-case basis, because of urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. H.R.2 would limit that authority. In particular, the bill would:   
Redefine what it means for parole to be granted on a “case-by-case basis,” so that such grants cannot be made categorically based on membership in a defined class of noncitizens, as the Biden administration did for nationals from Ukraine and Afghanistan;   
Narrowly define “urgent humanitarian reason” to mostly encompass medical emergencies, the imminent death of a family member in the U.S., or the funeral of a family member;   
Narrowly define “significant public benefit” to apply to a foreign national who is assisting the U.S. government in a law enforcement matter;   
Carve out limited exceptions, including for certain Cuban nationals, some spouses and children of active-duty military members, and foreign nationals in Mexico or Canada who have pending immigration hearings in the U.S.;  
Bar most parolees from legally working in the U.S.; and  
Generally restrict parole timelines to the shorter of either one year or the required period to accomplish the stated activity for which parole was granted, with limited options to extend.   
If enacted, these provisions would constrain the executive branch’s ability to expeditiously respond to national security and humanitarian events. Recently, parole has been used to efficiently admit Afghans, Ukrainians, Venezuelans, and Cubans fleeing violence and instability.  It has also provided a vehicle for certain nationalities to come to the U.S. legally, relieving pressure at the U.S.-Mexico border by allowing for a more orderly pathway.  
5. The bill would criminalize overstaying a legal visa 
H.R.2 would establish criminal penalties for individuals who overstay a visa in the U.S. for ten or more days. In particular, it would:   
Punish a first offense with no more than six months in prison and a fine of up to $1,000; and   
Punish a subsequent offense with no more than two years in prison and a fine of up to $2,000.   
A sizable proportion of the U.S.’s undocumented community entered the country legally and overstayed a visa. Under current law, overstaying a visa is a civil violation, and those who do so are subject to potential immigration consequences, but not criminal penalties. H.R.2 would change that, by making people who overstay visas subject to criminal charges similar to the ones imposed on those who enter the U.S. without authorization. Such a policy would have far-reaching consequences for a broad swathe of people — a tourist who remained in the U.S. for an extra few weeks, a future spouse awaiting his visa — who have little to do with the situation at the border.  
6. The bill would mandate employers to electronically verify the immigration status of their workers 
H.R.2 would mandate that U.S. employers use an electronic employment verification system to verify the employment status of their workforce. Under the bill, employers would be required to collect and retain verification that they are not hiring undocumented workers. In particular, the bill would:   
Enact a nationwide requirement, for the first time, that employers verify the eligibility of workers to legally work in the U.S., creating an onerous system that would put pressure on small business employers and key industries;   
Require employers to attest under penalty of perjury that they had verified a potential employee was not undocumented;   
Make employers verify the employment eligibility of workers through a new Employment Eligibility Verification System (EEVS) that was established and administered by DHS;   
Mandate employers to terminate employment for foreign nationals who are confirmed as ineligible to work; and   
Increase criminal penalties for systemic hiring violations, including imprisoning violators for up to 18 months and fining them up to $5,000 for each unauthorized worker.  
During an April 19 markup in the House Judiciary Committee of the Border Security and Enforcement Act of 2023 — one of the bills folded into this larger package — these provisions raised bipartisan red flags around privacy and potential technological errors that could keep even eligible people from working. Because these new verification requirements are not being coupled with legal workforce reforms that would ensure an adequately-sized pool of authorized workers, they threaten to spark alarm in critical sectors that are already facing labor shortages. For example, nearly half of U.S. agricultural workers are undocumented, and such stringent verification requirements could jeopardize Americans’ access to a reliable food supply.   
Conclusion 
The Secure the Border Act of 2023 would compromise the U.S.’s long-standing tradition of refuge, while restricting existing lawful pathways that bolster our nation’s humanitarian and national security priorities. It would not address what is driving the perception of disorder at the U.S.-Mexico border: our broken immigration system.  
Amid a hemispheric displacement crisis that will continue to force migrants and asylum seekers from their homes, an enforcement-only approach like this one will not provide U.S. officials with the infrastructure and resources they need to adequately respond. Instead, Congress must work together on bipartisan reforms that pair smart border security with lawful and orderly pathways to the U.S., while also reinforcing our nation’s longstanding commitment as a safe haven for those fleeing persecution.

MEDIA ADVISORY: HIGGINS ANNOUNCES SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON FENTANYL SMUGGLING BY CARTELS
July 5, 2023
Committee begins phase two of investigation into Secretary Mayorkas’ failure to secure our borders
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Chairman Clay Higgins (R-LA) announced a hearing next Wednesday, July 12, at 2:00 PM ET, to examine the role of Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs), particularly the Mexican drug cartels, in trafficking illicit fentanyl into the United States. This hearing will launch the second phase of the House Committee on Homeland Security’s full-scale oversight investigation into Secretary Mayorkas’ dereliction of duty that has led to the most devastating crisis at the Southwest border in our nation’s history.
“The reckless open border policies set by President Biden and Mayorkas have greatly benefited the Mexican cartels,” said Congressman Higgins. “The cartels quickly learned to outmaneuver the system, and with the help of the Chinese Community Party, they have smuggled an unprecedented amount of fentanyl, taken a record number of American lives, brought in billion-dollar profits, and have torn families apart. Secretary Mayorkas’ blatant disregard for the security and sanctity of the American people has wounded our great nation deeply. This Subcommittee will ensure that we hold Mayorkas accountable for his dereliction of duty.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden would veto a House GOP bill that aims to restrict asylum, build more border wall and cut a program that allows migrants a chance to stay in the U.S., including Ukrainian refugees, the White House said Monday.
Republicans are looking to capitalize as immigration trouble surges into a national spotlight this week with the ending of COVID-19 restrictions that allowed border authorities to quickly return many migrants who crossed the border illegally.
GOP lawmkers aim to vote on their Secure the Border Act on Thursday — the same day the emergency expulsion powers expire. Officials have already seen an increase of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and are bracing for more.
The legislation represents the GOP’s first major immigration policy proposal since the Trump era, when immigration opponents controlled the White House. The 213-page bill resurrects a slew of former President Donald Trump’s policies, such as building barriers along hundreds of miles of border country, and in some cases pushes beyond his efforts.

It faces strong headwinds from some Republicans representing agricultural areas over requirements that businesses verify employees’ legal immigration status, and even if it passes the majority-Republican House, it stands little chance of passing the Democratic-held Senate. But if it were to end up on the president’s desk, he’d veto it.
The Biden administration regularly argues that Congress needs to act significantly on the border in order to fix major problems that have led to record numbers of people illegally crossing. But this isn’t the way to do it, in the view of the White House.
“While we welcome Congress’ engagement on meaningful steps to address immigration and the challenges at the border, this bill would make things worse, not better,” says a statement from the White House Office of Management and Budget. “Because this bill does very little to actually increase border security while doing a great deal to trample on the nation’s core values and international obligations, it should be rejected.”
In the absence of legislation, the Biden administration has adopted policy shifts beginning this week that pair stricter enforcement at the border with a growing avenue for migrants to apply for asylum, as long as they come legally, have a sponsor and pass background checks. The decisions are an effort to persuade immigrants to skip the dangerous journey north and to apply for asylum through a new app, or at regional hubs opening in Guatemala and Colombia.
Congress in past decades has traditionally tackled overhauls to border security and immigration law by coupling stronger border-enforcement measures with policy changes that expanded legal pathways or provided legal status for undocumented immigrants already in the U.S.
The House GOP is applying the same logic — pairing a border security package with changes in immigration reform rules — in hopes of uniting mainstream and far-right lawmakers. But instead of expanding legal pathways for migrants, the package restricts them.
“Joe Biden sent a message that America’s border is open, and millions of people answered that call and started coming across our border illegally,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said at a news conference, adding, “We’re going to show the president how to solve the problem.”
The bill would expand border wall building, which was a major focus of Trump, who claimed he was going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. It would also essentially choke off asylum, requiring migrants to cross legally, pay a $50 fee and meet more stringent requirements to show in initial interviews that they are fleeing political, religious or racial persecution.
It would also cut the program that has allowed U.S. officials to accept or quickly turn away some migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua. The program is a cornerstone of Biden’s immigration efforts, allowing migrants from those countries to apply to come to the U.S. for two years legally and work. It could also, in theory, bar Ukrainian refugees since they are in the U.S. under the same type of agreement.
Scalise, on Twitter Monday, called the legislation “the strongest border security package in history” and said that Biden’s veto promise showed the president “has no plan to solve the crisis he created.”
The White House statement from the management and budget office said the Republican bill stands to “cut off nearly all access to humanitarian protections in ways that are inconsistent with our nation’s values and international obligations.” It would also cut necessary funding.
Meanwhile in the Senate, Sens. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, and Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona independent, have proposed legislation that would give federal officials the power to quickly expel migrants for another two years. The pair are also working on a Senate proposal that would expand legal immigration while increasing border security.
Some House Republicans hope their bill could offer a start to negotiations with the Senate.
As lawmakers began forming the proposal last month, Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican who has pushed for years for immigration rule changes, said, “We have to in the House, get the votes to pass a serious border security bill to make sure that this issue doesn’t just go away.”

Department of State and Department of Homeland Security Announce Additional Sweeping Measures to Humanely Manage Border through Deterrence, Enforcement, and Diplomacy
FACT SHEET
OFFICE OF THE SPOKESPERSON
MAY 10, 2023
The Department of Homeland Security and Department of State are focused on solutions and have a robust plan to humanely manage the border through deterrence, enforcement, and diplomacy. With the support of the Department of Defense and multiple countries across the Western Hemisphere, DHS and State are implementing that plan within the constraints of a broken immigration system that Congress has repeatedly failed to fix, including by not acting on President Biden’s comprehensive immigration reform proposal, bipartisan legislation to protect Dreamers and farm workers, or repeated requests for additional resources.
At 11:59 PM ET on Thursday, May 11, the pandemic-era Title 42 public health order will lift because COVID-19 is no longer the threat it once was, and the public health emergency is ending. When the Title 42 order lifts, the United States will be strengthening its enforcement of long-standing Title 8 immigration authorities to expeditiously process and remove individuals who arrive at the U.S. border unlawfully and do not have a legal basis to remain. Individuals who cross into the United States at the southwest border without authorization or without having used a lawful pathway, and without having scheduled a time to arrive at a port of entry, will be presumed ineligible for asylum, absent an applicable exception. If removed, they will be barred from re-entry for at least five years and subject to potential criminal prosecution for repeated attempts to enter unlawfully.
The transition back to Title 8 processing for all individuals encountered at the border will be effective immediately when the Title 42 order lifts.
Today, as part of the comprehensive, multi-agency, multi-country plan to prepare for the return to processing migrants under Title 8 authorities, the Administration is announcing additional sweeping measures, including:
Opening the First Regional Processing Centers to Direct Individuals to Lawful Pathways. The State Department plans to eventually open about 100 regional processing centers at key locations in the Western Hemisphere, and in the coming days will launch an online platform for individuals to make appointments to arrive at a center near them. Over 140 Federal personnel, including from DHS and State, and personnel from the International Organization on Migration and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are being deployed to support these brick-and-mortar centers, which will serve to direct migrants to lawful pathways early in their journey and well before reaching the southwest border. Personnel at Regional Processing Centers will screen individuals for eligibility for U.S. refugee resettlement or other lawful pathways to the United States, Canada, and Spain.
Deploying First Group of Additional Troops to Support Border Patrol. The initial 550 U.S. military personnel will be in place Wednesday, starting in El Paso, to begin supporting U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the southwest border. They will join the 2,500 National Guard troops already supporting CBP at the border. These additional troops will provide administrative support at CBP facilities, including data entry, warehousing assistance, and augmenting CBP surveillance and detection activities so that CBP agents and officers can get out in the field to secure and humanely manage the border. The remaining 1,000 troops will be announced soon and will include Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force personnel.
Surging Additional Resources to Manage Increased Encounters. To humanely manage increased encounters, CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are further expanding detention capacity, ramping up removal flights, and shifting agents and officers to high-priority regions along the southwest border. This week CBP opened two new holding facilities, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is increasing its bed capacity to prepare for a potential increase in unaccompanied children. DHS also launched targeted enforcement operations in high-priority regions along the border, including El Paso, to quickly process migrants and place them in removal proceedings. DHS last week also announced over $250 million in additional assistance for communities receiving migrants.
Expanding Access to the CBP One App. DHS will transition the CBP One App to a new appointment scheduling system on May 10, in order to enable improved access to this orderly process for seeking asylum into the United States. Under the new system, noncitizens will have additional time to request appointments and, if allocated an appointment, will have additional time to confirm that appointment. When allocating appointments, CBP will work to prioritize noncitizens who have waited the longest. This change will give noncitizens more time to navigate the appointment scheduling app, and therefore help ensure that noncitizens with limited connectivity have meaningful opportunities to schedule appointments to present themselves at southwest border ports. In addition, CBP will also increase the number of available appointments available each day.
Issuing New Rules to Encourage Migrants to Use Lawful Pathways. The Biden-Harris Administration has led the largest expansion of lawful pathways for protection in the United States in decades. DHS and DOJ will be issuing a final rule to encourage individuals to use those lawful pathways instead of seeking to enter the United States between ports of entry without prior authorization along the southwest border. This rule is critical to creating an orderly process to seek protection in the United States at a time when Congress refuses to reform broken immigration laws or provide the necessary funds to hire sufficient asylum officers and immigration judges to process claims.
Ramping Up Efforts to Counter Misinformation. Smugglers have stepped up their efforts to falsely claim the border is open in order to profit off vulnerable migrants. In response, the Department of State and DHS are stepping up their efforts to counter this misinformation, including by launching additional digital advertising campaigns in Central and South America, and in the Caribbean. This campaign will communicate clearly that individuals who unlawfully cross the U.S. southwest border will be presumed ineligible for asylum under new regulations, will be subject to expedited removal, and will be barred from reentry to the United States for at least five years, if ordered removed. The Department of State is also amplifying information about lawful migration pathways and efforts to address the root causes of migration. This information is broadcast via social media, newspapers, television, and radio in high-out-migration areas across the region.
The additional measures announced today build on actions the Department of State and DHS announced earlier this month to humanely manage the border through deterrence, enforcement, and diplomacy. This also builds on DHS’s work over the past year that was first outlined in the April 2022 DHS Plan for Southwest Border Security and Preparedness. Those actions included:
Deterrence
Surging Panamanian, Colombian, and U.S. authorities to the Darien to improve security of this region and root out the criminal smuggling networks
Doubling the number of refugees to be accepted from the Western Hemisphere
Expanding and creating new family reunification programs
Accepting up to 30,000 individuals per month from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Haiti as part of the expanded parole processes announced earlier this year
Imposing consequences for migrants who fail to use lawful pathways, including a five-year ban on reentry and presumption of ineligibility under a new regulation
Subjecting individuals to expedited removal, with consequences for those ordered removed, including a five-year bar on reentry
Enforcement
Sending 1,500 troops to the border (bringing the total to 4,000 troops), while DHS is bringing on thousands of DHS contractors and non-uniformed employees to assist in administrative tasks to free up more of the agency’s 24,000 agents and officers to focus on frontline duties.
Surging asylum officers to expedite processing times from months to days for recent border crossers. Holding Credible Fear Interviews for certain populations earlier on in the process, enabling DHS to quickly remove those who don’t have a legal basis to remain.
Expanding CBP holding capacity by more than 50%.
Dramatically scaling up the number of weekly removal flights, with the number of flights doubling or tripling for some countries.
Diplomacy
Securing repatriation agreements from countries in the Western Hemisphere, including diplomatic efforts with Mexico to quickly remove individuals who cannot be returned to their countries of origin.
Stepping up joint Mexico-United States enforcement actions to counter-human smugglers and traffickers that are exploiting migrants.
Mexico and the United States redoubling their development efforts that focus on people-to-people support.
Multiple federal agencies are working to manage the border using the tools they have. But, Congress needs to update our immigration laws. Congress also needs to provide the funds the administration requested, including the $4.9 billion for border security and management that Congress cut in half.

FACT SHEET: President Biden’s Budget Strengthens Border Security, Enhances Legal Pathways, and Provides Resources to Enforce Our Immigration Laws
HOME
OMB
BRIEFING ROOM
PRESS RELEASES
President Biden has taken historic steps to secure our border and rebuild a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system that was gutted by the previous Administration. Over the past two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has secured more resources for border security than any of the presidents who preceded him, deployed the most agents ever—more than 23,000—to address the situation at the border, prevented record levels of illicit fentanyl from entering our country, and brought together world leaders on a framework to deal with changing migration patterns that are impacting the entire Western Hemisphere. The Administration has also put in place new measures to enhance security at the border and reduce the number of individuals crossing unlawfully between ports of entry while expanding and expediting legal pathways for orderly migration for individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The President also outlined new consequences for those who fail to use these new legal pathways.
The President’s Budget includes billions of dollars to keep America’s borders secure and enforce our immigration laws, while expanding legal pathways for migrants seeking asylum. Funding will be used to modernize border facilities, invest in technology, ensure the safe and humane treatment of migrants in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody, and reduce the backlog of immigration cases. Unlike some Congressional Republican officials who are playing political games and obstructing real solutions to fix our broken immigration system, President Biden has a plan and is taking action. The Budget:
Enhances Border Security and Immigration Enforcement. Strengthening border security and providing safe, lawful pathways for migration remain top priorities for the Administration. The Budget includes nearly $25 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an increase of almost $800 million over the 2023 enacted level when controlling for border management amounts. The Budget includes funds for CBP to hire an additional 350 Border Patrol Agents, $535 million for border security technology at and between ports of entry, $40 million to combat fentanyl trafficking and disrupt transnational criminal organizations, and funds to hire an additional 460 processing assistants at CBP and ICE.
Supports a Fair, Orderly, and Humane Immigration System. The Administration is committed to improving the Nation’s immigration system and safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits. The Budget includes $865 million for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to process the increasing asylum caseloads, reduce the historically high immigration benefit request backlog, support the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, and improve refugee processing to achieve the Administration’s goal of admitting up to 125,000 refugees.
Addresses the Situation at the Southwest Border. Given elevated southwest border encounter levels experienced since 2019, the Budget proposes a new $4.7 billion contingency fund to aid the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its components when responding to migration surges along the southwest border. Each fiscal year the fund would receive appropriations incrementally, and above the base appropriation, as southwest border encounters reach pre-identified levels. DHS would be limited to obligating funds for surge-related functions, and would transfer funds to CBP, ICE, and FEMA accounts with valid surge-related responsibilities.
Improves Immigration Courts. Providing resources to support legal representation in the immigration system would help make the system fairer and more equitable, while allowing for greater efficiencies in case processing.The Budget invests more than $1.5 billion in the Executive Ofﬁce for Immigration Review (EOIR) both to manage and mitigate the backlog of over 1.8 million cases currently pending in the immigration courts that this Administration largely inherited from its predecessor. This funding supports 150 new immigration judge teams, which includes the support personnel required to help optimize the operation of the immigration court system. The Budget would also invest new resources in legal access programming, including $150 million in discretionary resources to provide access to representation for adults and families in immigration proceedings.
Supports America’s Promise to Refugees. The Budget provides $7.3 billion to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to help rebuild the Nation’s refugee resettlement infrastructure and respond to the needs of unaccompanied children. The funding would support the resettlement of up to 125,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2024 and allow ORR to reinforce and expand on the programmatic improvements this Administration has made in the unaccompanied children program, including expanding access to counsel to help children navigate complex immigration court proceedings and enhancing case management and post-release services. In addition, the Budget includes an emergency contingency fund that would provide additional resources, beyond the $7.3 billion, when there are unanticipated increases in the number of unaccompanied children or other humanitarian entrants, building on the contingency fund enacted for 2023.
Creates Opportunities in Central America and Haiti. The Budget requests more than $1 billion to advance the President’s commitment to work with Congress to provide $4 billion over four years to address the root causes of migration and help the people of the region create safer, more stable futures in their home communities. Assistance would bolster localization efforts, enhance the rule of law, and support economic growth for all segments of society. Further, in response to deteriorating conditions and widespread violence in Haiti, the Budget invests $291 million to strengthen Haiti’s recovery from political, health, and economic shocks, such as strengthening the capacity of the Haitian National Police, combating corruption, strengthening the capacity of civil society, responding to health emergencies and health needs, and supporting services for marginalized populations.
Bolsters Hemispheric Economic Investment and Migration Management Efforts. In support of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, the Budget invests $430 million for hemispheric migration management. This assistance would bolster stability for affected communities, enhance legal pathways and protection in the hemisphere, and strengthen humane border management throughout the region. The Budget proposes more than $50 million for a new regional economic opportunity fund, the Americas Partnership Opportunity Fund, to support partner countries in the region hosting large populations of refugees and migrant. The budget requests up to $40 million for the Global Concessional Financing Facility to support programs aimed at improving the lives of migrants and refugees in the Western Hemisphere. The Budget also includes $75 million for the Inter-American Development Bank’s IDB Invest to increase private sector investment in the Americas.

Homeland Security Investigations
HSI IS A VITAL U.S. ASSET IN COMBATING CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ILLEGALLY EXPLOITING AMERICA’S TRAVEL, TRADE, FINANCIAL AND IMMIGRATION SYSTEMS
Today, America is safer thanks to the agents of HSI
HSI is the principal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, responsible for investigating transnational crime and threats, specifically those criminal organizations that exploit the global infrastructure through which international trade, travel and finance move. HSI’s mission is to investigate, disrupt and dismantle terrorist, transnational and other criminal organizations that threaten or seek to exploit the customs and immigration laws of the United States.
Overview
HSI has broad legal authority to conduct federal criminal investigations into the illegal cross-border movement of people, goods, money, technology and other contraband throughout the United States. HSI utilizes these authorities to investigate a wide array of transnational crime, including: terrorism; national security threats; narcotics smuggling; transnational gang activity; child exploitation; human smuggling and trafficking; illegal exports of controlled technology and weapons; money laundering; financial fraud and scams; worksite and employment crimes; cybercrime; intellectual property theft and trade fraud; identity and benefit fraud; and human rights violations and war crimes.
In collaboration with its strategic partners in the U.S. and abroad, HSI special agents gather evidence to identify and build criminal cases against Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs), terrorist networks and facilitators, and other criminal elements that threaten the United States. HSI works with prosecutors to indict and arrest violators, execute criminal search warrants, seize criminally derived money and assets, and take other actions designed to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations operating around the world. These efforts protect U.S. national, border, and economic security, and ensure the safety of the public and our communities.

HSI – FY 2022 Achievements
HSI – Historic Origins
Homeland Security Investigations' (HSI) story begins in 1789 when Congress established the U.S. Customs Service and in 1891 with the creation of the Office of the Superintendent of Immigration under the Treasury Department.
Customs houses were used as administrative headquarters at ports of entry around the country. Customs officials inspected, taxed, stamped and released imported goods. The agency also stopped banned items from entering the country. Officials used ships, called cutters, to stop ships bearing cargo at sea and to prevent smugglers from bringing items ashore. The list of barred items changed over time, but included undeclared liquor, tobacco, firearms, drugs, stolen property and certain foods. The 1976 Arms Export Control Act gave Customs the additional authority to investigate and prevent international weapons trafficking.
The Immigration Act of 1891 made immigration a federal function. Immigration inspectors at various ports of entry inspected passenger manifests, conducted health inspections and accepted or rejected prospective immigrants. In 1906, Congress passed the Basic Naturalization Act, which framed the rules for naturalization within the United States. The law established standard naturalization forms and encouraged state and local courts to relinquish their naturalization jurisdiction to federal courts.
In 1933, Congress established the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 expanded INS’ responsibilities by allowing it to investigative certain gang, fraud and human smuggling activities, and enforce sanctions against employers who hired illegal aliens. Additionally, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 enabled the hiring of additional INS special agents for interior enforcement and bolstered certain criminal penalties, including those for alien smuggling.
On Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists aboard American Airlines Flight 11 intentionally crashed a plane into the World Trade Center's North Tower. The tower was home to the U.S. Customs House at 6 World Trade Center.
After the events of 9/11, the U.S. government created a stronger approach to national security with the passage of the Homeland Security Act and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The department was formed by combining 22 different federal organizations into a unified force.
In 2003, Customs and INS were merged into the department’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In 2010, HSI was formed within ICE from elements of ICE’s previous Offices of Investigations, Intelligence and International Affairs.

CBP Releases January 2023 Monthly Operational Update
Release Date Fri, 02/10/2023
Encounters Between Ports of Entry at Lowest Level Since February 2021
WASHINGTON — U.S. Customs and Border Protection released operational statistics today for January 2023, which can be viewed online.
“The January monthly operational update clearly illustrates that new border enforcement measures are working, with the lowest level of Border Patrol encounters between Ports of Entry since February of 2021,” said CBP Acting Commissioner Troy Miller. “Those trends have continued into February, with average encounters of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans plummeting.”
CBP Southwest Border Enforcement Numbers for January 2023
U.S. Border Patrol encounters of individuals who entered the country between Ports of Entry at the southwest border in January 2023 totaled 128,410, down 42% from 221,675 in December 2022. This is the lowest month of Border Patrol encounters since February 2021 when encounters began to increase after the most severe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on migration. 
CBP total encounters in January 2023 were 156,274, down nearly 40% from 251,978 in December 2022. This total includes Border Patrol encounters and noncitizens processed at Ports of Entry including individuals who sought an exception to Title 42 based on certain vulnerabilities and scheduled an appointment to present in advance via the CBP One Application. 
Over two-thirds (69.5%) of all southwest land border encounters were single adults, with 108,573 encounters in January, a 33% decrease compared to December.
64,499 encounters, 41.3% of the total, were processed for expulsion under Title 42. 91,775 encounters were processed under Title 8.
57,589 encounters involving single adults (53% of all single adult encounters) were processed for expulsion under Title 42, with 50,984 processed under Title 8 (47% of all single adult encounters).
6,779 encounters involving family unit individuals (17.8% of all family unit individuals) were processed for expulsion under Title 42, with 31,308 processed under Title 8 (82.2% of all family unit individuals).
In January 2023 there were 39,680 (25%) repeat encounters and 115,226 (74%) unique encounters. The number of unique individuals encountered in January 2023 was 115,226 compared to 216,429 in December 2022, a 47% decrease in the number of unique individuals encountered the prior month.
Of those, 25% involved individuals who had at least one prior encounter in the previous 12 months, compared to an average one-year re-encounter rate of 14% for FY2014-2019.
Unaccompanied Children
Encounters of unaccompanied children decreased 23.5 percent, with 9,393 encounters in January compared with 12,283 in December. In January, the average number of unaccompanied children in CBP custody was 334 per day, compared with an average of 570 per day in December.
Family Unit individuals
Encounters of family unit individuals decreased by 50.1% from 77,155 in December to 38,087 in January—which is a 56.5% decrease from the peak of 87,461 in August 2021.
The significant decrease in Border Patrol encounters, well beyond that which is expected based on seasonal trends, is indicative of the success of the measures announced by the Administration on January 5, 2023 expanding safe and orderly lawful processes for migration while applying consequences to those who do not avail themselves of those processes. 
During January, 11,637 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (including immediate family members where applicable) were paroled into the country by Office of Field Operations through the parole processes established for Venezuelans in October and expanded to the additional nationalities in January. Arrivals of noncitizens via these processes, which include careful vetting and require a supporter present in the Unites States, are a testament to the benefit of these lawful processes in promoting safe and orderly migration while reducing encounters along the Southwest Border.  
Encounters of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans between ports of entry at the southwest border declined from a 7-day average of 1,231 on the day of the announcement on January 5th, to 59 on January 31—a drop of 95 percent in just over three weeks. Those trends have endured so far through the month of February.  The reduction occurred even as encounters of other noncitizens began to rebound from their typical seasonal drop.

Over two-thirds (69.5%) of all southwest land border encounters were single adults, with 108,573 encounters in January, a 33% decrease compared to December.
64,499 encounters, 41.3% of the total, were processed for expulsion under Title 42. 91,775 encounters were processed under Title 8.

CBP One App
In January, CBP processed 21,661 individuals at POEs as exceptions to Title 42 based on an individual vulnerability assessment. This includes 9,902 individuals between January 18 and 31 who scheduled an appointment to present at a POE using the newly available functionality in the CBP One mobile application. While the high demand for these appointments has meant that not all individuals seeking appointments have yet been able to schedule them (individuals commonly waited more than three months in shelters to be considered under the Title 42 exception process before the use of CBP One), the transition of the exceptions process to CBP One allows more open access and has provided immediate benefits in reducing the exploitation of vulnerable persons seeking to present at POEs. Over 20,000 individuals have scheduled an appointment via CBP One and the top nationalities who have done so are Venezuelan and Haitian.
CBP Nationwide Total Encounters for FY23TD through January: 1,072,400
In January 2023 there were 41,068 (20%) repeat encounters and 125,811 (60%) unique encounters. The number of unique individuals encountered in January 2023 was 125,811 compared to 226,079 in December 2022, a 44% decrease in the number of unique individuals encountered the prior month.
Of those, 20% involved individuals who had at least one prior encounter in the previous 12 months, compared to an average one-year re-encounter rate of 12% for FY2014-2019.
Ongoing Migration Management Efforts
CBP continues to enforce U.S. immigration law and public health authority and apply consequences to those without a legal basis to remain in the United States. Current restrictions at the U.S. border have not changed; single adults and families encountered at the Southwest border will continue to be expelled, where appropriate, under the CDC’s Title 42 public health Order. Once the Title 42 public health order is no longer in place, CBP will process all individuals encountered at the border using its longstanding Title 8 authorities.
Under Title 8, those who attempt to enter the United States without authorization, and who are unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States will be quickly removed.  Individuals who have been removed under Title 8 are also subject to additional long-term consequences beyond removal from the United States, including bars to future immigration benefits.
DHS has been executing a comprehensive and deliberate strategy to secure our borders and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system. The strategy is based on six pillars: surging resources; increasing efficiency to reduce strain on the border; employing an aggressive consequence regime; bolstering the capacity of NGOs and partner with state and local partners; going after cartels and smugglers; and working with our regional partners. This comprehensive plan leverages a whole-of-government approach to prepare for and manage the current and anticipated increases in encounters of noncitizens at our Southwest border.
International Travel and Trade
One of CBP’s core mission objectives is to enhance the nation’s economic prosperity, including through the facilitation of lawful trade and travel. CBP continues to protect America’s national and economic security by facilitating legitimate trade while rigorously enforcing U.S. customs laws and regulations.

Since travel restrictions were eased on November 8, 2021 CBP has processed increased numbers of arriving travelers without any significant delays. The rules allow noncitizen, non-lawful permanent resident travelers seek to enter the United States for non-essential travel via land ports of entry and ferry terminals, provided they are fully vaccinated and have appropriate documentation. The guidelines also allow most non-immigrants (non-U.S. citizens and other covered persons) who are fully vaccinated to travel by air to the United States, regardless of the reason for travel.
CBP tracks traveler numbers and wait times and continuously adjusts as needed to make the travel experience more efficient. Travelers can plan by doing the following:
Have a valid Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative document, such as a passport, Trusted Traveler Program card, or Enhanced Tribal Card.
Possess proof of an approved COVID-19 vaccination as outlined on the CDC website. 
Verbally attest to their travel intent and COVID-19 vaccination status.
Be prepared to present any documents requested by the CBP officer.
Trade Stats/Seizures – Protecting the American Consumer
CBP works diligently with the trade community and port operators to ensure that merchandise is cleared as efficiently as possible. CBP works with the trade community to strengthen international supply chains and improve border security. There are several programs by which CBP works with importers, carriers, consolidators, licensed customs brokers, and manufacturers to advance information about the shipments and expedite the inspection process at the ports of entry. CBP is available to conduct exams and is ready and willing to expand hours of operations if necessary to meet the growing demand for imported goods.
In January 2023 alone, CBP processed more than 2.6 million entry summaries valued at more than $265 billion, identifying estimated duties of nearly $7.3 billion to be collected by the U.S. government. In January, trade via the ocean environment accounted for more than 44.15 percent of the total import value, followed by air, truck, and rail.
In January 2023, CBP identified 282 shipments valued at more than $69 million for further examination based on the suspected use of forced labor, and which may be subject to a Withhold Release Order, Forced Labor Finding, or the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act’s rebuttable presumption, and prohibited importation into the United States under 19 U.S.C. § 1307.
Intellectual property rights violations continue to put America’s innovation economy at risk. Trade in counterfeit and pirated goods threaten the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, the livelihoods of American workers, and the health and safety of consumers.
In January 2023, CBP seized 1,514 shipments that contained counterfeit goods valued at more than $186 million.
CBP completed 27 audits that identified $7.7 million in duties and fees owed to the U.S. government, stemming from goods that had been improperly declared in accordance with U.S. trade laws and customs regulations.  CBP collected over $7 million of this identified revenue and from previous fiscal years’ assignments. 
Drug Seizures
CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and Air and Marine Operations agents continue to interdict the flow of illicit narcotics across the border. Nationwide, drug seizures (Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Heroin, Fentanyl, and Marijuana) by weight decreased 8.9% in January compared to December. Seizures by weight were as follows:
Cocaine seizures decreased 49.5%  
Methamphetamine decreased 4.1% 
Heroin seizures decreased 66.4% 
Fentanyl seizures decreased 77%  
Additional CBP drug seizure statistics can be found at www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/drug-seizure-statistics.
Agriculture Stats/Seizures – Securing American Agriculture
In January 2023, CBP agriculture specialists helped protect America’s agriculture, natural resources, and economic prosperity.
CBP issued 5,547 emergency action notifications for restricted and prohibited plant and animal products entering the United States.
CBP conducted 98,064 positive passenger inspections and issued 1,001 civil penalties and/or violations to the traveling public for failing to declare prohibited agriculture items.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the comprehensive management, control, and protection of our nation’s borders, combining customs, immigration, border security, and agricultural protection at and between official ports of entry.

Home About DHS Mission
Mission
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its homeland security mission are born from the commitment and resolve of Americans across the United States in the wake of the September 11th attacks. In those darkest hours, we witnessed true heroism, self-sacrifice, and unified resolve against evil. We rallied together for our common defense, and we pledged to stand united against the threats attacking our great Nation, fellow Americans, and way of life.
Together, we are committed to relentless resilience, striving to prevent future attacks against the United States and our allies, responding decisively to natural and man-made disasters, and advancing American prosperity and economic security long into the future.
In the many years since the September 11th attacks, the Department has marshaled this collective vision to face new and emerging threats against the Homeland. To do so, we are instilling a “culture of relentless resilience” across the United States to harden security for the threats on the horizon, withstand attacks, and rapidly recover. We are raising security baselines across the world, addressing systemic risks, and building redundancies for critical lifelines that enable our prosperity and way of life. Perhaps most importantly, we are forging partnerships to strengthen public, private, and international cooperation and crowd-sourcing solutions that outpace the intentions of our adversaries.
As the complex threat environment continues to evolve and loom, the Department will embody the relentless resilience of the American people to ensure a safe, secure, and prosperous Homeland.
In addition to our underlying core values and guiding principles, there are six overarching homeland security missions that make up our strategic plan:
Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security Threats
Image
One of the Department’s top priorities is to resolutely protect Americans from terrorism and other homeland security threats.
Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security Threats
Secure U.S. Borders and Approaches

GAO CONTACTS
Issue Summary
The federal government is responsible for conducting a number of activities to protect U.S. borders and enforce immigration laws, mainly through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). However, there are a number of areas in which these agencies can improve how they manage and implement these activities, on which they spend billions of dollars each year.
For instance:
DHS’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for securing U.S. borders at and between ports of entry. Within CBP, U.S. Border Patrol operates over 100 immigration checkpoints along U.S. borders where agents screen vehicles to identify noncitizens who are potentially removable; they may also enforce U.S. criminal law. Agents are required to collect data on checkpoint activity, including how many smuggled people are apprehended and how many drug seizures were made using canines. However, agents at checkpoints inconsistently documented this data, which makes oversight of these checkpoints difficult.
Border Patrol Checkpoint Canine Team Inspects a Vehicle
DHS’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for immigration enforcement within the United States. This includes making arrests and providing safe confinement of noncitizens in detention facilities.  ICE obtains immigration detention space through contracts and agreements but has not consistently followed its process for obtaining new space. Further, ICE does not have a strategic approach for using guaranteed minimum payments in its contracts—i.e., paying for beds regardless of use—and spent millions of dollars a month on unused detention space.
ICE and other DHS agencies oversee compliance with standards at immigration detention facilities, and receive complaints from detainees. However, ICE doesn't comprehensively analyze inspection or complaint information to identify trends. It also doesn't have reasonable assurance that all complaints are addressed.
ICE made nearly 15,000 segregated housing placements—which is where individuals are in one or two-person cells separate from the general population—from FYs 2017-2021. ICE monitors segregating housing placements involving vulnerable persons—e.g., those with medical or mental health conditions. But it relies on reports and data that don't always have enough detail about the circumstances leading to a placement or indicate that a placed person is vulnerable. As a result, ICE can't adequately oversee segregated housing.
Segregated Housing Cell in a Detention Facility
  ICE is also responsible for monitoring noncitizens it releases into the community during their immigration court proceedings, and has increasingly used its Alternatives to Detention program to do so. The program offers ICE options for monitoring people (e.g., GPS or home visits) to help ensure compliance with release requirements, such as appearing in court. ICE uses a $2.2 billion contract to administer this program, but it doesn't fully assess how the program is working or ensure that the contractor meets standards.
DHS’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processes millions of applications and petitions for immigration benefits each year from noncitizens who want to visit or live in the country, obtain work authorization, or become U.S. citizens. USCIS’s pending caseload has increased by 85% in recent years due to factors like policy changes, longer forms, staffing issues, and delays from COVID-19. USCIS has not developed a long-term strategic workforce plan to help address workforce challenges and reduce its pending caseload.
USCIS also investigates potential immigration fraud. For example, USCIS investigates concerns that some marriages are formed to evade U.S. immigration law or illegally obtain immigration benefits, such as permanent residence. USCIS uses a staffing model to estimate how many immigration officers it needs for its antifraud workload. However, the model doesn't adequately reflect operating conditions and some data may be inaccurate due to inconsistent data entry practices USCIS has also made a variety of changes to its antifraud activities, including the addition of new antifraud activities. However, USCIS has not evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of its antifraud activities to help ensure that it is preventing, detecting, and responding to potential fraud. 
The Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) conducts immigration court removal proceedings. At the start of FY 2023, EOIR had a backlog of about 1.8 million pending cases, which means that some individuals have been waiting years to have their cases heard. Taking steps to improve its workforce planning would better position EOIR to address its staffing needs and the case backlog.

BRIEFING ROOM
SPEECHES AND REMARKS
Roosevelt Room
11:54 A.M. EST
THE PRESIDENT: Hi, everybody. Sorry to keep you waiting. There’s a lot going on.
Today, I’d like to — the Vice President and I would like to talk you about how my administration is dealing with our situation in the southwest border.
Now, these actions alone that I’m going to announce today aren’t going to fix our entire immigration system, but they can help us a good deal in better managing what is a difficult challenge.
On my first day in office, some of you may recall, who cover this area — and they cover it well — I sent Congress a comprehensive piece of legislation that would completely overhaul what has been a broken immigration system for a long time: cracking down on illegal immigration; strengthening legal immigration; and protecting DREAMers, those with temporary protected status, and farmworkers, who all are part of the fabric of our nation.
But congressional Republicans have refused to consider my comprehensive plan. And they rejected my recent request for an additional $3.5 billion to secure the border and funds for 2,000 new asylum personnel, another — asylum officers and personnel — and 100 new immigration judges so people don’t have to wait years to get their claims adjudicated, which they have a right to make a claim legally.
And the failure to pass and fund this comprehensive plan has increased the challenges that we’re seeing at our southwest border. No one knows this better than the Vice President.
And to truly understand what’s happening there, it’s important to step back and see our — see the bigger picture here.
You know, I — I know it’s hard to see, but because our politics has been so divisive — you know it’s getting much better, as you’ve all observed, but it’s been so darn divisive that it — it clouds the picture. I mean, it clouds the picture.
But let me explain what I’m going to do in — as clearly and plainly as I can. I know it’s a complicated issue. I don’t want to pretend there’s anything easy about it.
People come to America for a whole lot of different reasons. To seek new opportunity in what is the strongest economy in the world. Can’t blame them wanting to do it. They flee oppression, you know, to the — to the freest nation in the world. They chase their own American Dream in the greatest nation in the world.
And the story of America is the story of so many of your families — including mine, going back to the mid-1800s from Ireland.
Now, there are a number of ways to immigrate to America legally under our existing laws. For example, an American citizen — an American citizen can sponsor an immediate family member from another country. An American company can sponsor an employee from another country. There are visas for students to study in our colleges and other special categories.
And regardless of the legal pathway they pro- — they process — they process them to require everyone be involved in following the law. That’s the notion. There are laws to get here legally. That includes another legal way for someone to come to America by seeking asylum because they’re fleeing persecution, like a lot of our ancestors did as well.
And for many people, that’s what’s happening at our southwest border now.
Over the past several years, thousands of people have been fleeing from Central and South America and the Caribbean countries ruled by oppressive dictators — including Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — and escaping gang violence, which has the same impact, in Haiti.
Currently, these four countries account for most of the people traveling into Mexico to start a new life by getting at the — to the American border and trying to cross.
But instead of safe and orderly process at the border, we have a patchwork system that simply doesn’t work as it should. We don’t have enough asylum officers or personnel to determine whether people qualify for asylum. There’s a standard by what you have to meet. You don’t — we don’t have enough immigrant judges — immigration judges to adjudicate the claims of immigrants.
In fact, the previous administration used a rule called Title 42 to deal with — to deal with the pandemic, a rapidly — to rapidly expel people who crossed the border. It was a — designed to deal with the pandemic, but it’s used as a means to expel people at the border.
People turned away under Title 42, and they are not — and — and they’re not barred from trying to come back. They’ve been turned away. They go back. They try again. They try again. Well, you know, they can and they do try to re-enter the United States again and again, which makes the problem that borders — at the border even worse.
And under the United States Supreme Court decision, a case on Title 42 later this year, my administration will — and they will make a decision, finally, what to do about Title 42. In the meantime, my administration will continue to use that authority as the Supreme Court has required.
And until Congress passes the funds — a comprehensive immigration plan to fix the system completely — my administration is going to work to make things better at the border using the tools that we have available to us now.
Today, my administration is taking several steps to stiffen enforcement for those who try to come without a legal right to stay, and to put in place a faster process — I emphasize a “faster process” — to decide a claim of asylum, someone who says, “I’m coming because I’m escaping oppression.” Well, there’s got to be a way to determine that much quicker for people who are credibly seeking protection from persecution.
Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas will detail these actions very shortly, after I finish, at Homeland Security.
But here’s one significant step we’re taking: Over the summer, we saw a huge spike in the number of Venezuelans traveling through — through Mexico and attempting to enter the United States without going through our legal processes.
They res- — we responded by using and ensuring that there are two safe and lawful ways for someone leaving the country to come to America. And that was one of the reasons you — you were proposing.
First, if they’re seeking asylum, they can use an app on their cell phone called CBP One — O-N-E — CBP One — O-N-E. That’s to spell it out, not the number “1.” To schedule an appointment at a port of entry and make their asylum claim there without crossing the border unlawfully and have a decision determined by an asylum officer, do they qualify.
Second, in October, we worked with the Mexican government to launch a new parole program. There’s another program called the — you all know it, but the public may not — called the “parole program” that immediately showed results by reducing the number of people crossing the border unlawfully. The way this parole program works: One must have a lawful sponsor here in the United States who agrees to sponsor you to get here.
Then, that person has to go — undergo rigorous background checks and apply from outside the United States and not cross the border illegally in the meantime.
If they apply and their application is approved, they can use the same app, the CBP One app, to present at a port of entry and be able to work in the United States legally for two years. That’s the process.
But if their application is denied or if they attempt to cross into the United States unlawfully, they will be returned back to Mexico and will not be eligible for this program after that.
So, they — if they — if they — we’re making the program available. If they apply and they do it properly, fine. If they — if they don’t apply and they try to come through, they’re not going to have an opportunity to deal with the program.
This new process is orderly, it’s safe, and it’s humane. And it works.
Since we created the new program, the number of Venezuelans trying to enter America without going through a legal process has dropped dramatically, from about 1,100 per day to less than 250 per day on average. That’s several hundred people on average every single day who are not crossing into America illegally.
Today I’m announcing that my administration is going to expand the parole program for people not only from Venezuela but from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti.
Again, these four countries — Venezuela, Cuba and — Cuba and Nicaragua and Haiti — these four countries account for most of the people now traveling into Mexico to try to start a new life by crossing the border into the United States of America on the southwest border.
We anticipate this action is going to substantially reduce the number of people attempting — attempting to cross our southwest border without going through a legal process.
In fact, today I’m announcing that Mexico has agreed to allow up to re- — to return up to 30,000 persons per month who try, get caught, and get sent back from those four countries
who are apprehended while attempting to unlawfully cross the border — the southwest border.
My message is this: If you’re trying to leave Cuba, Nicaragua, or Haiti, you have — and we — or have agreed to begin a journey to America, do not — do not just show up at the border. Stay where you are and apply legally from there.
Starting today, if you don’t apply through the legal process, you will not be eligible for this new parole program.
Let me reiterate: You need a lawful sponsor in the United States of America, number one. And you need to undergo a rigorous background check, number two.
If your application is approved and you show up at — at a U.S. airport or when and where directed — (coughs) — excuse me — you have access.
But if your application is denied or you attempt to cross into the United States unlawfully, you will not be allowed to enter.
Look, we should all recognize that as long as America is the land of freedom and opportunity, people are going to try to come here. And that’s what many of our ancestors did, and it’s no surprise that it’s happening again today.
We can’t stop people from making the journey, but we can require them to come here, and they — that they come here in an orderly way under U.S. law.
And let me say it again: The actions we’re announcing today will make things better — will make things better but will not fix the border problem completely. There’s more that has to be done, and I laid that out in the first week I was here.
That work will not be done unless and until the Congress enacts and funds a more comprehensive immigration plan that I proposed on day one.
Until Congress has acted, I — I can act where I have legal capacity to do so.
Last year, I brought together 20 leaders — many of you were there — from the Western Hemisphere — heads of state — to stabilize the flow of immigration, to expand pathways to immigration, and to manage border — and to manage the border humanely.
The leaders of the hemisphere have built on those efforts that I led when I was Vice President to expand economic assistance to nations in north Central America so people here can — there — there can improve their economic prospects at home, instead of having to leave for the United States.
Most people would much rather stay in the country they are if they can feed their families, be safe, send their kids to school, and have opportunity.
It’s not like people — you’ve heard me say it before: It’s not like people are sitting around a table in — somewhere in Central America and saying, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have. Let’s give it to a coyote, a smuggler. They’ll take us on a harrowing journey for thousands of miles to get to the United States, then we’re going to illegally cross the border. They’re going to drop us in a desert. And we’re — in a place where we don’t speak the language. Won’t that be fun?” I’m not being facetious.
Well, [Vice] President Harris led this effort — led this effort to make things better in the countries from which they are leaving. And thanks to her leadership, she’s been able to generate more than $3.2 billion from the private sector to create jobs and opportunities in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to help people stay in their own countries — home countries where it’ll be safer and they have some opportunities.
We’ve also set up a joint patrols and law enforcement with Mexico and Guatemala that share real-time information on locations that smugglers are using to convince migrant groups to cross illegally.
That’s what they’re doing. This is — they’re — they’re out recruiting — recruiting — they’re taking all the savings or anything they have to take them on an incredibly dangerous journey.
We embedded our Border Patrol officers with Mexican patrols to detect and — and raid human smuggling operations. This has been — we — thus far, there have — more than 7,000 arrests of human smugglers in the last six months. Seven thousand.
That’s not just human smuggling at the border. We’re focused on cracking down on drug smuggling, which is a serious and deadly promise — or, excuse me, a pro- — problem. And I made a promise we would try this.
My administration has allocated record funding that added hundreds of additional Border Patrol agents and installed new cutting-edge technologies to be able to use incr- — effectively — you know, it’s like a X-ray machine, detailed to be able to look through these large containers to determine what’s in the container and — at the border.
For example, since August of last year, Customs and Border Patrol have seized more than 20,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl. That’s enough to kill — kill as many as 1,000 people in this country. Twenty thousand pounds of fentanyl. It’s a killer. It’s a flat killer.
And next week, I’m going to travel to Mexico where I’m going to meet with President López Obrador. We have a big agenda that ranges from the climate crisis to economic development and other issues. But one important part of that agenda is strengthening our border between our nations.
And I will visit the border myself this Sunday, in El Paso, to assess border enforcement operations, meet with the local officials and community leaders and the folks at the border sending me what they need that they don’t have, and make it public what they conclude they need they don’t have to try to convince my Republican colleagues they should do something.
And I know that migration is putting a real strain on the borders and on border communities. They can’t do but — anything but that.
We’re going to get these communities more support. And I want to thank all the nonprofits, the faith groups, the community leaders, and other volunteers who will make sure that vulnerable immigrants have what they need to survive, whether it’s food, warm clothing, shelter, medical care right after their arrival.
These religious and civic groups represent our — our nation’s generosity — the best of our country. They really do. They really do. And they’re a powerful rebuke to the hostility and even the hate which many people face when they arrive here legally.
So let me close with this. Our problems at the border didn’t arise overnight and they’re not going to be solved overnight. It’s a difficult problem.
It’s clear that immigration is a political issue that extreme Republicans are always going to run on. But now they have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points or they can help solve the problem. They can help solve the problem and come together to fix the broken system.
Before Congress adjourned for the holidays, some Democrats and Republicans, a few of them, got together — both sides, up in the Senate — and decided they were going to put together a comprehensive plan on immigration.
But the Republican leadership and other Republi- — I don’t know who — exactly who did it — rebuked it and rejected it out of hand — it broke up — just like they rejected my plan two years ago, just like they rejected my recent request for an additional $3.5 billion to secure and manage the border with more holding facilities, better transportation, additional funding for 2,000 new asylum officers and personnel, 100 new immigration judges to more rapidly adjudicate for people when they come here, and how much — and so much more.
Think about it. I mean, if this were something if we were — if we had to have 100 more immigration officers to see to it that we’re able to import something we needed very badly, it wouldn’t take very much time to get it, would it? It’d be real done. Or, conversely, if there were criminal gangs coming into the — into the nation or the — I mean —
But when it comes to immigration, it seems like it’s a better issue — a better issue for them than trying to solve it.
Look, we need me- — we need more resources to secure the border. Yet again, extreme Republicans have said no. Many Republicans agree we should do something. But it’s time to stop listening to their inflammatory talk, and it’s time to look at their record.
As I’ve always done when I sit down — I’ll sit down with anyone who, in good faith, wants to fix our broken immigration system. And it’s hard. It’s hard on the best of circumstances. But if the most extreme Republicans continue to demagogue this issue and reject solutions, I’m left with only one choice: to act on my own, do as much as I can on my own to try to change the atmosphere.
Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue. We can make it that way again. It’s not only the right thing to do, it’s economically a smart thing to do.
That’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone. Think of this now. I re- — want to remind the public: Immigration reform is supported by the American labor movement — unions. It’s supported by religious leaders. It’s supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
We can secure our border, fix the immigration system to be orderly, fair, safe, and humane. We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigration to America — many of our forebearers, many of yours.
We can do this by remembering who we are. You’ve heard me say this a million times. We’re the United States of America. The idea this is beyond our capacity, I just don’t buy. We can do anything if we do it together.
And you’ve heard me say it also, many times: God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
I’m going to stop here. And in a few minutes — literally, a few minutes; Secretary Mayorkas and I have been coordinating — he’s going to be speaking in much greater detail and will take questions at the Department of Homeland Security headquarters.
So, I want to thank you for your time. And this is going to be — this is a hard one to — to deal with, but we have to deal with it. I mean, we — it’s who we are.
Q Mr. President, do you believe that immigr- — that migration is a human right? Activists say that it is. What’s your take?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it is a human right if — to have your — if your family is being persecuted, if you’re being dealt with in a way — I mean, like it was — I thought it was a human right for, you know, Jews in Germany to be able to go — to get to escape and get help where they could.
But the other side of this is there’s also — the people in this country have basic rights — that are here — basic fundamental rights to assure the people who are coming have been checked out. They’re not criminals. They’re not problem. They’re — you know, that their background checks are real. They —
I mean, look, if you think about it, there’s not a whole lot of countries people would rather live in than here. No, I mean it sincerely. I think about this, and I think this is — sometimes, the team looks at me like maybe I’m out of my mind here.
But all kidding aside, if you just said, tomorrow, “All right, for the next year, you can move to any country you want without any questions.” How many people do you think are going to leave the United States? And I can name any of the 140-some countries I’ve been to — there’s more than that. I think you’d get — a lot would be willing to leave and come here. So, there — there’s a rationale. There has to be an orderly process and a rationale to it.
But it is — and there’s other ways we can deal with this, as I said. You may remember — no, you — I don’t think you’re old enough to have been doing it when I was doing it as a senator, when I came up with a proposal to have billions of dollars of funding for the — Central America to keep people where they are. Remember, we were putting —
And it was very, very precise. For example, if the country was in economic difficulty — and most of them are because of climate and other things — and we’d say, “Okay. Well, we have a pro- — they have a problem. Well, guess what? They don’t have lighting in their — in their town squares. They can’t — they can’t, you know, assure the safety of people walking the streets.”
Well, if their leader asked for money, we made them sign a proposal that they’re going to do lighting in the town squares — what they’re going do, exactly what they’re going to do. We checked it out, we put it in, and it began to work.
Or hospitals — where you have hospitals that don’t function because they don’t have the following. Well, one of the reasons people will stay is if you’ve improved the hospital. We were doing that.
And the thing that I’m so — presumptive of me to say “proud of” — but proud of the Vice President, she went beyond the United States and contributors to try to get the rest of the world to say, “Look, this makes sense.”
And you know, she got commitments of 3.5, I think?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Two. Three point two.
THE PRESIDENT: $3.2 billion.
And so, there’s a — there’s a lot to be done. And think about it. Even back in days when — it’s so easy to demagogue this issue. It’s so easy to demagogue it. And you hear, you know, a number of our friends, the MAGA Republicans, talking about, you know, “They don’t even want me to speak in English anymore. They want me speak in dah, dah, dah. They’re going to — they’re going to take over my community, my nei…” “They.” “They.” Whoever “they” are at the time.
Well, you know, that’s what a lot of folks went through when they got here, going all the way back to the 1800s. It’s not new. It’s — part of it is human nature and fear.
But there’s got to be an orderly way. And I know we can make it much, much better.
Q Mr. President, why did you decide that now is finally the right time to visit the southern border? Republicans have been calling on you to do this since the beginning of your presidency.
THE PRESIDENT: Because the Republicans haven’t been serious about this at all. Come on. They haven’t been serious about this at all.
I wanted to make sure that I knew what the outcome — at least the near outcome was on Title 42 before I went down. We don’t have that yet, so I had to operate — I don’t like Title 42. But it’s the law now, and I have to operate within it.
It’s — my prediction is — it’s not — there’s nothing particularly insightful about this: Title 42 is going to go away before the end of the year, in terms of the Supreme Court, in my prediction. And then we’re going to have to use Title 9 — Title 8.
Eight, right? Am I right? Yeah. Title 8. Eight, nine — (laughs).
And — which is — which we can implement what we’re doing here plus some other things.
But so, I wanted to make sure there was a rational way in which we could begin to announce it, but I couldn’t wait once the Supreme Court ruled that they’re not going to make the final decision on Title 42 for some time — you know, for another — who knows? Probably not until June — in that range, although I don’t know that for a fact — to be able to lay this out.
But, look, Mayorkas is waiting to impress you all, all kidding aside.
Q Are you concerned about the effect that requiring an airline ticket could prejudice or sort of make — lean it toward wealthier migrants and —
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Q — kind of make it harder for poorer migrants?
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. But there’s also ways to get to ports of entry along the border as well.
Q So — I’m sorry.
Q Go ahead.
Q So the ceasefire proposed by — by President Putin in Ukraine for the Orthodox Christmas on January 6th, 7th — have you heard about that? Do you have a reaction to whether it’s —
THE PRESIDENT: I’m reluctant to respond to anything Putin says. I found it interesting. He was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches and with the — with — on the 25th and New Year’s. And, I mean, you know, I — I think he’s trying to find some oxygen.
Thank you so very much.
Q Are you still monitoring the Speaker’s race? Are you still watching the Speaker’s race?
THE PRESIDENT: I’m monitoring — I’m — I’m following it with great — how can I say it?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Attention.
THE PRESIDENT: Attention. (Laughter.)

DHS Continues to Prepare for End of Title 42; Announces New Border Enforcement Measures and Additional Safe and Orderly Processes
Release Date: January 5, 2023
En español Lu an Kreyòl
WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to prepare for the end of the Title 42 public health order, which is currently the subject of multiple court orders, and a return to processing all noncitizens under the Department’s Title 8 immigration authorities. To that end, DHS today announced new border enforcement measures to improve border security, limit irregular migration, and create additional safe and orderly processes for people fleeing humanitarian crises to lawfully come to the United States. These measures, taken together, are concrete steps to enhance the security of our border while the Title 42 public health order is in place, and that DHS will continue to build on in preparation for the Title 42 order being lifted. 
DHS is establishing new parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, modeled on the successful processes for Venezuelans and Ukrainians, which combine safe, orderly, and lawful pathways to the United States, including authorization to work, with significant consequences for those who fail to use those pathways. We are also continuing the process with respect to Venezuelans. 
Through the CBP One app, we are also providing a new mechanism for noncitizens to schedule appointments to present themselves at ports of entry, facilitating safe and orderly arrivals. Initially this will be used for those seeking an exception from the Title 42 public health order. Once the Title 42 order is no longer in place, CBP One will be used to help ensure safe and orderly processing at ports of entry. 
DHS is increasing and enhancing the use of expedited removal under Title 8 authorities for those who cannot be processed under the Title 42 public health order. These efforts include surging personnel and resources and enrolling individuals under the asylum processing interim final rule published in March 2022.   
As a complement to these efforts, and in response to the unprecedented surge in migration across the hemisphere and to reduce encounters at our border, DHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) intend to shortly issue a proposed rule that will, subject to public comment, incentivize the use of the new and existing lawful processes available in the Unites States and partner nations, and place certain conditions on asylum eligibility for those who fail to do so.  
DHS will continue to monitor developments on the southwest border and will accelerate or implement additional measures, as needed, consistent with applicable court orders. 

“We can provide humanitarian relief consistent with our values, cut out vicious smuggling organizations, and enforce our laws,” said Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “Individuals without a legal basis to remain in the United States will be subject to prompt expulsion or removal. Individuals who are provided a safe, orderly, and lawful path to the United States are less likely to risk their lives traversing thousands of miles in the hands of ruthless smugglers, only to arrive at our southern border and face the legal consequences of unlawful entry.” 

As required by a combination of the Supreme Court’s December 27 order and a separate district court injunction prohibiting the implementation of the CDC termination of the Title 42 public health order, the Title 42 order remains in effect, and individuals who attempt to enter the United States without authorization will continue to be expelled. 

Country-Specific Enforcement Processes 

Building upon the success of Uniting for Ukraine and the process for Venezuelans announced in October – which combine a safe and lawful pathway with a consequence for failing to use that pathway – today’s announcement establishes similar processes for Cuban, Haitian, and Nicaraguan nationals who face unique challenges in their home countries. The Venezuelan process also will continue; Border Patrol saw a dramatic drop – 90 percent – in the number of Venezuelans encountered at the border following the establishment of the program in October. Nationals from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua who do not avail themselves of this process, attempt to enter the United States without authorization, and cannot establish a legal basis to remain will be removed or returned to Mexico, which will accept returns of 30,000 individuals per month who fail to use these new pathways. The expansion of the Venezuela process to Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua is contingent on the Government of Mexico’s willingness to accept the return or removal of nationals from those countries. It also is responsive to a request from the Government of Mexico to provide additional legal pathways for migrants, and it advances both countries’ interests in addressing the effects throughout the hemisphere of deteriorated conditions in these countries.  

Specifically, these processes will provide a lawful and streamlined way for qualifying nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to apply to come to the United States, without having to make the dangerous journey to the border. Through a fully online process, individuals can seek advance authorization to travel to the United States and be considered, on a case-by-case basis, for a temporary grant of parole for up to two years, including employment authorization, provided that they: pass rigorous biometric and biographic national security and public safety screening and vetting; have a supporter in the United States who commits to providing financial and other support; and complete vaccinations and other public health requirements. Individuals who enter the United States, Mexico, or Panama without authorization following today’s announcement will generally be ineligible for these processes. These processes will allow up to 30,000 qualifying nationals per month from all four of these countries to reside legally in the United States for up to two years and to receive permission to work here, during that period.     

Starting tomorrow, potential supporters can apply to DHS to support eligible individuals via www.uscis.gov/CHNV. Individuals and representatives of organizations seeking to apply as supporters must declare their financial support, and they must pass security background checks to protect against exploitation and abuse.  

Safe and Orderly Processes at Ports of Entry 

To facilitate the safe and orderly arrival of noncitizens seeking an exception from the Title 42 public health order, DHS is expanding use of the free CBP One mobile app for noncitizens to schedule arrival times at ports of entry. Individuals do not need to be at the border to schedule an appointment; expanded access to the app in Central Mexico is designed to discourage noncitizens from congregating near the border in unsafe conditions. Initially, this new scheduling function will allow noncitizens to schedule a time and place to come to a port of entry to seek an exception from the Title 42 public health order for humanitarian reasons based on an individualized assessment of vulnerability. This will replace the current process for individuals seeking exceptions from the Title 42 public health order, which requires noncitizens to submit requests through third party organizations located near the border. 

Once the Title 42 public health order is no longer in place, this scheduling mechanism will be available for noncitizens, including those who seek to make asylum claims, to schedule a time to present themselves at a port of entry for inspection and processing, rather than arriving unannounced at a port of entry or attempting to cross in-between ports of entry. Those who use this process will generally be eligible for work authorization during their period of authorized stay.     

Individuals who use the CBP One app will be able to schedule an appointment to present themselves at the following ports of entry:   
Arizona: Nogales; 
Texas: Brownsville, Hidalgo, Laredo, Eagle Pass, and El Paso (Paso Del Norte); and 
California: Calexico and San Ysidro (Pedestrian West – El Chaparral).  
During their inspection process, noncitizens must verbally attest to their COVID-19 vaccination status and provide, upon request, proof of vaccination against COVID-19 in accordance with Title 19 vaccination requirements. 

Individuals will be able to schedule appointments in CBP One in the coming days. The CBP One application is free to download and available in the Apple and Google App Stores as well as at https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone. 

Enhanced Use of Expedited Removal 

We will comply with the court orders that require us to continue enforcing the Title 42 public health order. There are, however, migrants who cannot be expelled pursuant to Title 42 authorities and as a result are processed under Title 8 authorities. For those processed under Title 8, we are increasing and enhancing our use of expedited removal, which allows for the prompt removal of those who do not claim a fear of persecution or torture or are determined not to have a credible fear after an interview with an Asylum Officer, in accordance with established procedures.  

This enhanced expedited removal process will include: dedicating additional resources including personnel, transportation, and facilities; optimizing processes across DHS and DOJ; and working with the State Department and countries in the region to increase repatriations. We also will continue to process individuals under the interim final rule published in March 2022 outlining procedures for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to process asylum requests for noncitizens found to have a credible fear. Together, these measures will allow for the prompt removal of those who do not have a legal basis to stay and improve our overall preparedness for when the Title 42 public health order is lifted. Individuals removed under Title 8 are subject to a five-year bar on admission and potential criminal prosecution should they seek to reenter.  

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 

As a complement to these efforts, and in response to the unprecedented surge in migration across the hemisphere and to reduce encounters at our border, DHS and DOJ intend to issue a proposed rule to provide that individuals who circumvent available, established pathways to lawful migration, and also fail to seek protection in a country through which they traveled on their way to the United States, will be subject to a rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility in the United States unless they meet exceptions that will be specified. Individuals who cannot establish a valid claim to protection under the standards set out in the new rule will be subject to prompt removal under Title 8 authorities, which carries a five-year ban on reentry. DHS and DOJ will invite public comment on the proposed rule. 

Overall, through today’s announcements, DHS is strengthening the availability of legal, orderly pathways to the United States while imposing consequences on those who fail to use pathways made available to them by the United States and its regional partners.  

These new measures complement ongoing efforts to increase refugee resettlement from the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. Government intends to welcome at least 20,000 refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean in Fiscal Year 2023 and 2024, putting the United States on pace to more than triple refugee admissions from the Western Hemisphere this Fiscal Year alone. This delivers on the President’s commitment under the Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection to scale up refugee admissions from the Western Hemisphere.  

Taken together, these efforts will: reduce irregular migration by disincentivizing migrants from taking the dangerous journey to the southwest border of the United States and attempting to cross without authorization; significantly expand lawful pathways to the United States for vetted individuals; and reduce the role for – and profits of – smuggling networks that callously endanger migrants’ lives for personal gain.  

The Department is taking these measures in light of Congress’s failure to pass the comprehensive immigration reform measures President Biden proposed on his first day in office and the economic and political instability around the world that is fueling the highest levels of migration since World War II, including throughout the Western Hemisphere. The surge in global migration is testing many nations’ immigration systems, including that of the United States. The actions announced today are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing commitment to enforce our laws and build a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system, and build on efforts outlined in the Department’s December 2022 Update on Southwest Border Security and Preparedness. Today’s announcements also show the imperative of partner countries working together, as agreed in the Los Angeles Declaration following the Summit of the Americas, to take action against smugglers and provide protection to asylum seekers. Hemispheric challenges require hemispheric solutions.  

Everyone agrees that we are operating within a fundamentally broken immigration system. The steps we are taking reflect the constraints of our outdated statutes, which have not been updated in decades and were designed to address a fundamentally different migratory reality than that which exists today along the southwest border and around the world. As it has since its first day in office, the Biden-Harris Administration continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that strengthens border security, holistically addresses the root causes of migration, and improves legal pathways. We also encourage Congress to provide critical funding and advance bipartisan efforts to create a fair, fast, and functioning asylum system – enabling those who merit protection to quickly receive it, and those who do not to quickly be removed. In the absence of such action, the Administration is committed to pursuing every avenue within its authority to secure our borders, enforce our laws, and stay true to our values as we build safe, orderly, and humane processes.

STATEMENTS AND RELEASES
New Measures Leverage Success of Venezuela Enforcement Initiative to Limit Disorderly and Unsafe Migration
While the courts have prevented the Title 42 public health order from lifting for now, the Biden-Harris Administration today is announcing new enforcement measures to increase security at the border and reduce the number of individuals crossing unlawfully between ports of entry. These measures will expand and expedite legal pathways for orderly migration and result in new consequences for those who fail to use those legal pathways. They also draw on the success of the Venezuela initiative, which launched in October 2022 and has resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of Venezuelan nationals attempting to enter the United States unlawfully.

The Administration is also announcing that it is surging additional resources to the border and the region, scaling up its anti-smuggling operations, and expanding coordination and support for border cities and non-governmental organizations. Importantly, the actions announced today are being implemented in close partnership with Mexico and governments across the Western Hemisphere.

While these steps will help address some of the most acute challenges at the Southwest border, they will not solve all of the problems in an immigration system that has been broken for far too long. That can only happen if Republicans in Congress who have spent the past two years talking about border security quit blocking the comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures President Biden proposed on his first day in office, and opposing the billions of dollars in additional funds the President has requested for border security and management.

Unlike some Republican officials playing political games and obstructing real solutions to fix our broken immigration system, President Biden has a plan and is taking action. Under the new enforcement measures announced today, the Biden-Harris Administration will:

Impose New Consequences for Individuals who Attempt to Enter Unlawfully

To facilitate a return to the processing of all noncitizens under Title 8 authorities when Title 42 eventually lifts, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is:
Increasing the Use of Expedited Removal. Effective immediately, individuals who attempt to enter the United States without permission, do not have a legal basis to remain, and cannot be expelled pursuant to Title 42 will be increasingly subject to expedited removal to their country of origin and subject to a five-year ban on reentry.
Announcing New Measures to Encourage Individuals to Seek Orderly and Lawful Pathways to Migration. DHS and the Department of Justice today are announcing their intent to propose a new regulation that would encourage individuals to seek orderly and lawful pathways to migration and reduce overcrowding along the southwest border and the strain on the immigration system.
Expand Legal Pathways for Safe, Orderly, and Humane Migration

The Biden-Harris Administration and its international partners in the region are also announcing new and expanded legal pathways to the United States and other countries that individuals can and should use to avoid consequences for crossing the border unlawfully. These include:
Expanding the Parole Process for Venezuelans to Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Cubans. Today, the Biden Administration is announcing it will extend the successful Venezuela parole process and expand it to nationals of Nicaragua, Haiti, and Cuba. Up to 30,000 individuals per month from these four countries, who have an eligible sponsor and pass vetting and background checks, can come to the United States for a period of two years and receive work authorization. Individuals who irregularly cross the Panama, Mexico, or U.S. border after the date of this announcement will be ineligible for the parole process and will be subject to expulsion to Mexico, which will accept returns of 30,000 individuals per month from these four countries who fail to use these new pathways.
Tripling Refugee Resettlement from the Western Hemisphere. The Biden-Harris Administration intends to welcome up to 20,000 refugees from Latin American and Caribbean countries during Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024, putting the United States on pace to more than triple refugee admissions from the Western Hemisphere this Fiscal Year alone. This delivers on the President’s commitment under the Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection to scale up refugee admissions from the Western Hemisphere.
Launching Online Appointment Portal to Reduce Overcrowding and Wait Times at U.S. Ports of Entry.  When Title 42 eventually lifts, noncitizens located in Central and Northern Mexico seeking to enter the United States lawfully through a U.S. port of entry have access to the CBP One mobile application for scheduling an appointment to present themselves for inspection and to initiate a protection claim instead of coming directly to a port of entry to wait. This new feature will significantly reduce wait times and crowds at U.S. ports of entry and allow for safe, orderly, and humane processing. 
New Legal Pathways to Other Countries Across the Region. Countries across the Western Hemisphere are delivering on their commitments under the Los Angeles Declaration to expand legal immigration pathways. Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Belize are each implementing new regularization or temporary protection policies to provide legal status to hundreds of thousands of migrants. Canada, Mexico, and Spain have expanded refugee resettlement and temporary work opportunities. Mexico and Guatemala have also significantly grown their asylum system. Individuals are encouraged to avail themselves of this wide range of legal pathways in the region and avoid the dangerous consequences of irregular migration.
Increasing Humanitarian Assistance in Mexico and Central America. The United States is announcing today nearly $23 million in additional humanitarian assistance in Mexico and Central America. This new assistance will help governments in the region respond to the increased humanitarian and protection needs of migrants, refugees and other vulnerable populations in their care. Recognizing that no one country can respond to these needs alone, this assistance will help support shelter, health, legal assistance, mental health and psychosocial support, water, sanitation, hygiene products, gender-based violence response, livelihoods, other protection related activities, and capacity building for partners. 
Surge Resources to Secure the Border, Disrupt Criminal Smuggling Networks, and Support Border Communities

The Biden-Harris Administration is surging resources and expanding efforts to securely manage the border, disrupt the criminal smuggling networks preying on vulnerable migrants, and support communities receiving migrants as they await their immigration enforcement proceedings. New and expanded efforts include:
Mobilizing Record Resources for Safe, Orderly, and Humane Processing of Migrants. The Biden Administration is marshalling available authorities and resources from across the Federal Government to help ensure the border is secure and well-managed when the Title 42 public health order eventually lifts. DHS and DOJ are surging asylum officers and immigration judges to review asylum cases at the border more quickly – with the aim of reducing initial processing times from months to days. The two agencies are also expanding capabilities and technologies to support faster processing, including by installing hundreds of phone lines and privacy booths to conduct these interviews and proceedings. DHS is also hiring and deploying additional agents and officers to join the over 23,000 already working to secure the border. In addition, DHS is significantly scaling up its air and ground transportation capabilities to quickly remove migrants when warranted or transport migrants to less-congested border sectors for further immigration enforcement proceedings.
Taking Thousands of Smugglers off the Streets and Countering Smuggler Misinformation. In Los Angeles earlier this year, President Biden announced a first-of-its kind operation against the multi-billion-dollar human smuggling industry. Since April, this operation has led to over 7,300 arrests, forcing many criminal smuggling organizations out of business. The Administration is also taking on the smuggler misinformation. The Department of State is expanding its paid and earned media outreach to ensure timely and accurate information is reaching migrants. Messaging and outreach will target high out-migration communities and migrant routes through relevant communications channels (e.g., radio, digital, trusted partners, and more.) with an estimated reach of over 85 million potential migrants
Expanding Coordination with and Support for Border Cities, Receiving Communities, and Non-Governmental Organizations. The Biden-Harris Administration is increasing funding available to border cities and those cities receiving an influx of migrants, in addition to strengthening ongoing coordination and collaboration across all levels of government. DHS is also expanding outreach efforts with local jurisdictions to provide coordination of resources and technical assistance support and the Administration has been facilitating coordination between state and local officials and other federal agencies. Additionally, the Administration will continue to mobilize faith-based and non-profit organizations supporting migrants, including those providing temporary shelter, food, and humanitarian assistance before often reuniting with family as they await the outcome of their immigration proceedings.
The Biden-Harris Administration will do everything within its authority and available resources to manage this challenge, but until and unless Congress delivers the funding as well as comprehensive immigration reform measures President Biden requested, the United States’ broken immigration system will indeed remain broken.

Unlawful Southwest Border Crossings Plummet Under New Border Enforcement Measures
Release Date: January 25, 2023
January 2023 on track for lowest monthly southwest border encounters since February 2021
WASHINGTON – Encounters of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan non-citizens attempting to cross the southwest border unlawfully has decreased drastically since President Biden announced an expanded parole program for these individuals, putting the month of January on track to see the lowest levels of monthly border encounters since February 2021.
Preliminary numbers from January show that encounters of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans crossing unlawfully between ports of entry at the southwest border declined 97% compared to December. Encounters with individuals from these countries dropped from a 7-day average of 3,367 per day on December 11, to a seven-day average of just 115 on January 24. The decline in encounters from those populations occurred even as encounters of other noncitizens are returning to customary levels after a typical seasonal decline over the holidays.
“These expanded border enforcement measures are working,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. “It is incomprehensible that some states who stand to benefit from these highly effective enforcement measures are seeking to block them and cause more irregular migration at our southern border.”
On January 5, President Biden announced additional border enforcement measures to limit illegal immigration, that coupled an expansion of safe, lawful and orderly pathways to come to the United States, and, where applicable, make protection claims, with new consequences on those who fail to avail themselves of these orderly pathways and instead seek to cross the southwest border without authorization.
The coupling of these measures has led to a dramatic reduction in the numbers of Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans seeking to cross illegally at the southwest border. The data continues to show that when there is a lawful and orderly way, people are less inclined to put lives in the hands of smugglers.
The new measures are based on the successful model previously used for individuals fleeing Venezuela, Ukraine, and Afghanistan. Since the parole program for Venezuelan nationals was announced, the number of individuals from Venezuela attempting to enter the United States unlawfully has continued to decline significantly -- even as overall border encounters rose in December due to smugglers spreading misinformation around the Title 42 public health order. The number of Venezuelans encountered at the southwest border have dropped from roughly 1,100 a day the week before that process was announced, to an average of 100 a day in January.

Solutions for a Humane Border Policy
AUTHOR NIJC Policy Team
The U.S. government and governments around the world are grappling with an increase in the number of people forcibly displaced from their homes by political and social oppression. Despite campaign commitments to restore humanity to immigration policy, the Biden administration has largely continued Trump-era policies at the U.S.-Mexico border. These policies blatantly undermine domestic and international asylum law; result in countless deaths; and create rather than mitigate chaos as people blocked from protection have little choice but to resort to multiple and more dangerous border crossing attempts.
What should the Biden administration be doing to address the humanitarian need at the border? There are other ways to address the situation at the border, leading with empathy and courage in compliance with the Refugee Act of 1980.
The administration can and should: 1) develop and support robust communication and planning between federal, state and local governments, and civil society, so that those arriving migrants in need of additional support can be matched with a destination with capacity to provide services; 2) fully fund and support civil society, including social and legal service providers; 3) create non-custodial, humanitarian reception centers at the border, instead of jailing migrants and asylum seekers; and 4) overhaul the federal immigration budget by moving funds away from detention and enforcement and toward asylum processing and humanitarian needs.
While taking these steps the administration must 5) abide by its obligation to ensure asylum access to those arriving at the United States’ borders and ports. The Refugee Convention, which Congress incorporated into U.S. law, was borne out of the horrors of World War II and the Nazi Genocide. It reminds us of a history we must not repeat, when the United States was among those countries that turned European Jewish refugees away, back to their deaths. Policies developed during the Trump administration, including the Title 42 mass expulsions policy and asylum bans that deny protection on the basis of a person’s manner of entry, stand in blatant violation of this obligation.
Processing large – even unprecedented – numbers of asylum seekers is possible. In the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there was an outpouring of support and political will to welcome Ukrainians forced to flee. In only a five-month period following the invasion, the United States processed and received more than 100,000 Ukrainians. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has tremendous authority and resources at its fingertips; with political will and a reprioritization of funding, the United States absolutely has the means to become a leader in the response to the global refugee crisis and to provide dignity and respect to those arriving at the border in search of safe haven.
  1. Support Robust Communication And Planning Between The Federal Government, State And Local Governments, And Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
Over the past year, anti-immigrant governors have engaged in political theater by providing arriving migrants with busing to cities including New York; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Philadelphia. The results have not been what the anti-immigrant forces behind them might have hoped – local governments and civil society quickly mobilized to welcome the arriving newcomers with dignity, shelter, and support. Despite this tremendous mobilization, however, the busing stunt has revealed a lack of systemic avenues for communication and coordination between the federal government, localities and NGOs, as well as a stunning lack of support from the federal government for local governments receiving large numbers of newly arrived migrants.
The administration’s newest border plan notes that, “DHS is also expanding outreach efforts with local jurisdictions to provide coordination of resources and technical assistance support and the Administration has been facilitating coordination between state and local officials and other federal agencies. Additionally, the Administration will continue to mobilize faith-based and non-profit organizations supporting migrants…as they await the outcome of their immigration proceedings.”
We encourage the administration to prioritize this commitment with urgency. When migrants arrive at the U.S. border, many already have a destination in mind where they have loved ones to support them, while others have no one and are in need of emergency shelter. Efficiently and smartly supporting migrants in designating their destination and obtaining transportation onward should be paramount. First, asylum seekers should be processed and released in a safe location at or near where they enter the United States, not moved elsewhere as is often the case today. For those with a final destination in mind, the federal government should support migrants in securing transportation to that destination. For people in need of temporary shelter, DHS must build the systems and capacity to quickly communicate with local governments and NGOs throughout the country to match arriving migrants with destinations that have shelter and social services capacity.
  2. Fully Fund And Meaningfully Support Civil Society Organizations Providing Respite, Shelter, Social And Legal Services To Arriving Migrants.
NGOs along the U.S.-Mexico border and throughout the United States are the heart of the United States’ reception system for arriving asylum seekers, but for too long they have made do with little funding and little support from the federal government.
The federal spending bill enacted in December 2022 includes $800 million for a new Shelter and Services grant program, to be administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and distributed as grants to state and local governments and NGOs providing support to newly arriving migrants. This new program is intended to replace the existing humanitarian grant program run through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP-H), which has allocated far smaller sums since 2019.
The White House and DHS should immediately focus attention on developing the Shelter and Support Program as a centerpiece of the United States’ approach to border reception. This newly created program offers an opportunity to remedy some of the limitations NGOs face in utilizing EFSP-H funds by, for example, disbursing funds as needed instead of on a reimbursement model and removing limitations on the use of funds for transportation and shelter costs. Because the funds are designed as a transfer from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to FEMA, the administration must zealously protect the new program’s integrity as a humanitarian funding structure, firewalled from CBP’s enforcement mission.
These funds, if distributed fairly and in close consultation with civil society, can spur dramatic capacity growth in NGOs that already have the trust of immigrant communities and deep expertise in providing respite and welcoming services.
  3. Explore Options For Non-Custodial, Humanitarian Reception Centers At The Border, In Consultation With Civil Society.
Today, people arriving at the U.S. border are processed through CBP facilities that are infamously punishing and inhumane. DHS officers unabashedly refer to CBP holding cells as the “dog pound” or kennel.” Using jail-like facilities to shelter arriving families and individuals seeking safety or a better life in the United States criminalizes the very act of migration and puts lives at risk.
A completely new approach to border processing infrastructure is needed. Recent legislative proposals, however, miss the mark by envisioning new facilities developed within the existing criminalizing framework, often maintaining CBP as the controlling authority for what would essentially be bigger, slightly less life-threatening jails. The Biden administration must develop new models for processing centers that are guided by humanitarian principles.
Many European nations have implemented different types of reception centers, and important lessons can be learned from these efforts. Reception centers should never be operated or controlled by an enforcement agency such as CBP, nor should freedom of movement be restricted for those undergoing processing. The centers should also be time-limited for the purpose of processing, with the goal of people moving on toward their final destinations within a few days and receiving individualized referrals for continuing services as needed. These principles are critical to ensuring that arriving migrants are willing and able to trust that the services provided by government agencies and NGOs within the center are toward a goal of fair case adjudication and integration, not enforcement.
Also toward that end, the Biden administration must engage early and often with civil society organizations to ensure that facilities are designed with easy access to legal, housing, and social services; and that relevant government agencies such as FEMA and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) are onsite to support registration and processing.
  4. Overhaul How Immigration Policy Is Budgeted By Moving Funds Away From Detention And Enforcement And Toward Asylum Processing And Humanitarian Needs.
DHS’s establishment over 20 years ago solidified the false perception of immigration as a security issue, and DHS’s budget continues to reflect that perception. A few numbers illustrate the disparate focus on enforcement over processing: For Fiscal Year 2023, Congress provided $2.8 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention system; but only $800 million to support local governments and NGOs providing humanitarian services and reception for arriving migrants. The bill funded CBP’s border security operations at $6.4 billion, but only provided $3.5 billion for domestic field operations that are responsible for processing including asylum screenings at ports.
Biden administration officials frequently state that Congress insufficiently funds them to manage the border adequately. Yet the White House’s budget requests continue to exponentially prioritize funding for detention and enforcement over processing and humanitarian support. The Biden administration has the opportunity to remedy this in coming months, when the White House presents its budget for Fiscal Year 2024 to Congress.
Phasing out or severely limiting immigration detention — a harmful and unnecessary system — would free up billions of dollars for humanitarian reception and processing. Imagine if NGOs providing shelter, respite, and legal and social services to arriving migrants were allocated $3 billion in grant funding instead of $800 million; people in need of services would be far better supported and therefore better able to thrive in their new lives in the United States. Similarly, moving even a portion of the billions spent on militarizing the border toward ensuring that border officers are trained and equipped to fairly and efficiently process arriving asylum seekers would relieve much of the strain the system is currently experiencing while also upholding the government’s international obligations.
  5. Respect And Maintain, At All Times, The Fundamental Right Of Migrants To Seek Asylum At The Border, Regardless Of Manner Of Entry Or Transit.
The right to access asylum upon arrival at a U.S. border is foundational to international and domestic refugee law. Section 1158 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code states that, “Any [person] who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival…), irrespective of such [person]’s status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section…”
This law is the result of bipartisan U.S. lawmaking that codified the right to non-discriminatory access to asylum at U.S. borders through the 1980 Refugee Act, bringing the United States into compliance with the international Refugee Convention, to which it is party (through its 1967 Protocol).
Today, the American public overwhelmingly supports asylum access, even as the U.S. government has lost sight of its obligation. In recent decades the United States has chosen to criminally prosecute migrants for their manner of entry and, along with other affluent countries, experimented with policies that facilitate pushing back asylum seekers and externalizing border controls. During the four years of the Trump administration, Stephen Miller designed and implemented a web of policies that decimated access to asylum at the border. The Biden administration is now making the incalculable error of continuing to erode this principle rather than seizing the opportunity to transform U.S. border policy in accordance with human rights norms.
Title 42 expulsions, asylum bans, immigration prosecutions and other policies that infringe on the basic right to asylum are systematically violent in their application, with harms disparately impacting Black, Brown and Indigenous immigrants. These policies combined to make last year the deadliest year on record for people trying to find safety in the United States, with more than 850 migrant deaths at the border. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has warned these policies are “not in line with international standards.”
The Biden administration must prioritize humane border solutions that are rooted in fairness, compassion and respect for international refugee protections.

CBP Releases December 2022 Monthly Operational Update
Release Date Fri, 01/20/2023
WASHINGTON — U.S. Customs and Border Protection released operational statistics today for December 2022, which can be viewed on the CBP Enforcement Statistics Fiscal Year 2023 page.
“The December update shows our new border enforcement measures are working. Even as overall encounters rose because of smugglers spreading misinformation around the court-ordered lifting of the Title 42 public health order, we continued to see a sharp decline in the number of Venezuelans unlawfully crossing our southwest border, down 82% from September 2022,” said CBP Acting Commissioner Troy Miller. “Early data suggests the expanded measures for Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans are having a similar impact, and we look forward to sharing the additional data in the next update.
“Importantly, we are continuing to see a shifting migration pattern, with individuals from Mexico and northern Central America accounting for just 24% of unique encounters in December, a significant drop from the 42% they represented a year ago, as more migrants arrived from countries like Cuba and Nicaragua. This new migration challenge is not unique to the United States. There are 2.5 million Venezuelans now living in Colombia and 1.5 million in Peru; Brazil and Chile are hosting more than 350,000 Haitians, and the number of displaced Nicaraguans in Costa Rica has more than doubled in the last 12 months alone.
“December’s operational update also illustrate the dedication of the CBP workforce in seizing fentanyl and other contraband, and ensuring America’s economic security by facilitating travel and trade.”
  CBP Southwest Border Enforcement Numbers for December 2022
In December, the large number of individuals fleeing failing communist regimes in Nicaragua and Cuba contributed to an increased number of migrants attempting to cross the border. Venezuelans, which previously constituted a part of that increase, continue to arrive at far lower numbers as a result of the migration enforcement process that includes expulsions to Mexico and lawful pathways. Venezuelans have dropped from roughly 1,100 a day the week before that process was announced, to roughly 100 a day consistently throughout December.
The number of unique individuals encountered on the southwest land border in December 2022 was 216,162, an 11 percent increase in the number of unique enforcement encounters from the prior month, driven largely by an increased number of individuals fleeing authoritarian regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua.
  Of the total unique encounters at the Southwest Land Border in December 2022, 77,043 were from Cuba or Nicaragua, which represents 36% of unique encounters.
Individuals from Mexico and northern Central America accounted for 52,776 unique encounters in December 2022, which represents 24% of unique encounters and a 6% drop from December 2021. By comparison, Mexicans and Northern Central American migrants accounted for 42% of unique encounters in December 2021.
The Venezuelan migration enforcement process is working:

  CBP Nationwide Total Encounters for FY23TD through December: 863,929
The number of unique individuals encountered nationwide in December 2022 was 225,797, a 10 percent increase in the number of unique enforcement encounters than the prior month.
In total, there were 251,487 encounters along the southwest land border in December, a 7 percent increase compared to November. Of those, 14 percent involved individuals who had at least one prior encounter in the previous 12 months, compared to an average one-year re-encounter rate of 14 percent for FY2014-2019.
Almost two-thirds (64 percent) of all southwest land border encounters were single adults, with 161,808 encounters in December, a 2.3 percent increase compared to November.
49,405 encounters, 20 percent of the total, were processed for expulsion under Title 42. 202,082 encounters were processed under Title 8.
  41,246 encounters involving single adults (25 percent of all single adult encounters) were processed for expulsion under Title 42, with 120,562 processed under Title 8 (75 percent of all single adult encounters).
7,932 encounters involving family unit individuals (10 percent of all family unit individuals) were processed for expulsion under Title 42, with, 69,156 processed under Title 8 (90 percent of all family unit individuals).
Unaccompanied Children
Encounters of unaccompanied children decreased 6.4 percent, with 12,298 encounters in December compared with 13,136 in November. In December, the average number of unaccompanied children in CBP custody was 570 per day, compared with an average of 597 per day in November.
Family Unit individuals
Encounters of family unit individuals increased by 22 percent from 63,316 in November to 77,088 in December —which is a 12 percent decrease from the peak of 87,461 in August 2021.
Ongoing Migration Management Efforts
CBP continues to enforce U.S. immigration law and apply consequences to those without a legal basis to remain in the United States. Current restrictions at the U.S. border have not changed; single adults and families encountered at the Southwest border will continue to be expelled, where appropriate, under the CDC’s Title 42 Order. Once the Title 42 public health order is no longer in place, CBP will process individuals encountered at the border without a legal basis to enter or stay using its longstanding Title 8 authorities.
Under Title 8, those who attempt to enter the United States without authorization, and who are unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States will be quickly removed. Individuals who have been removed under Title 8 are also subject to additional long-term consequences beyond removal from the United States, including bars to future immigration benefits.
DHS has been executing a comprehensive and deliberate strategy to secure our borders and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system. The strategy is based on six pillars: surging resources; increasing efficiency to reduce strain on the border; employing an aggressive consequence regime; bolstering the capacity of NGOs and partner with state and local partners; going after cartels and smugglers; and working with our regional partners. This comprehensive plan leverages a whole-of-government approach to prepare for and manage the current and anticipated increases in encounters of noncitizens at our Southwest border. Read more about the DHS Plan for Southwest Border Security and Preparedness.
  International Travel and Trade
One of CBP’s core mission objectives is to enhance the nation’s economic prosperity, including through the facilitation of lawful trade and travel. CBP continues to protect America’s national and economic security by facilitating legitimate trade while rigorously enforcing U.S. customs laws and regulations.

Since travel restrictions were eased on November 8, 2021 CBP has processed increased numbers of arriving travelers without any significant delays. The rules allow travelers who are non-U.S. persons to seek to enter the United States for non-essential travel via land ports of entry and ferry terminals, provided they are fully vaccinated and have appropriate documentation. The guidelines also allow most non-immigrants (non-U.S. citizens and other covered persons) who are fully vaccinated to travel by air to the United States, regardless of the reason for travel.
CBP tracks traveler numbers and wait times and continuously adjusts as needed to make the travel experience more efficient. Travelers can plan by doing the following:
Have a valid Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative document, such as a passport, Trusted Traveler Program card, or Enhanced Tribal Card.
Possess proof of an approved COVID-19 vaccination as outlined on the CDC website.
Verbally attest to their travel intent and COVID-19 vaccination status.
Be prepared to present any documents requested by the CBP officer.
Trade Stats/Seizures – Protecting the American Consumer
CBP works diligently with the trade community and port operators to ensure that merchandise is cleared as efficiently as possible. CBP works with the trade community to strengthen international supply chains and improve border security. There are several programs by which CBP works with importers, carriers, consolidators, licensed customs brokers, and manufacturers to advance information about the shipments and expedite the inspection process at the ports of entry. CBP is available to conduct exams and is ready and willing to expand hours of operations if necessary to meet the growing demand for imported goods.
In December 2022 alone, CBP processed more than 2.5 million entry summaries valued at more than $260 billion, identifying estimated duties of nearly $6.8 billion to be collected by the U.S. government. In December, trade via the ocean environment accounted for more than 40 percent of the total import value, followed by air, truck, and rail.
In December 2022, CBP identified 310 entries valued at more than $59 million for further examination based on the suspected use of forced labor, and which may be subject to a Withhold Release Order, Forced Labor Finding, or the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act’s rebuttable presumption, and prohibited importation into the United States under 19 U.S.C. § 1307.
Intellectual property rights violations continue to put America’s innovation economy at risk. Trade in counterfeit and pirated goods threaten the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, the livelihoods of American workers, and the health and safety of consumers.
In December 2022, CBP seized 1,501 shipments that contained counterfeit goods valued at more than $178 million.
CBP completed 26 audits that identified $86.9 million in duties and fees owed to the U.S. government, stemming from goods that had been improperly declared in accordance with U.S. trade laws and customs regulations. CBP collected over $25 million of this identified revenue and from previous fiscal years’ assignments.
  Drug Seizures
CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and Air and Marine Operations agents continue to interdict the flow of illicit narcotics across the border. Nationwide, drug seizures (Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Heroin, Fentanyl, and Marijuana) by weight increase 17.5 percent in December compared to November. Seizures by weight were as follows:
Cocaine seizures increased 32 percent
Methamphetamine decreased 4 percent
Heroin seizures increased 1 percent
Fentanyl seizures increased 52 percent
Additional CBP drug seizure statistics can be found here.
  Agriculture Stats/Seizures – Securing American Agriculture
In December 2022, CBP agriculture specialists helped protect America’s agriculture, natural resources, and economic prosperity.
CBP issued 5,641 emergency action notifications for restricted and prohibited plant and animal products entering the United States.
CBP conducted 83,463 positive passenger inspections and issued 619 civil penalties and/or violations to the traveling public for failing to declare prohibited agriculture items.
  U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the comprehensive management, control, and protection of our nation’s borders, combining customs, immigration, border security, and agricultural protection at and between official ports of entry.

CBP Releases November 2022 Monthly Operational Update
Release Date Fri, 12/23/2022
WASHINGTON — U.S. Customs and Border Protection released operational statistics today for November 2022, which can be viewed online.
“Individuals from Mexico and northern Central America accounted for just 30% of unique encounters in November, a significant drop from the 53% they represented a year ago, as more migrants arrive from a variety of other countries, including Cuba and Nicaragua,” said CBP Acting Commissioner Troy Miller. “This month’s operational update reflects CBP’s dedicated workforce diligently enforcing our laws concerning immigration while seizing fentanyl and other contraband, ensuring America’s economic security and facilitating travel and trade. It also reveals a return of international travel as compared to the depths of the pandemic and our commitment to effectively implementing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act as we mark the anniversary of its signing.”
CBP Southwest Border Enforcement Numbers for November 2022
The large number of individuals fleeing failing communist regimes in Nicaragua and Cuba is contributing to an increased number of migrants attempting to cross the border. Venezuelans, which previously constituted a part of that increase, continue to arrive at far lower numbers as a result of the migration enforcement process that includes expulsions to Mexico and lawful pathways. Venezuelans have dropped from roughly 1,100 a day the week before that process was announced, to roughly 100 a day consistently throughout November.
The number of unique individuals encountered on the Southwest Land Border in November 2022 was 204,155, a 4% increase in the number of unique enforcement encounters from the prior month, driven largely by an increased number of individuals fleeing authoritarian regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua.
Of the total unique encounters at the Southwest Land Border in November 2022, 68,044 were from Cuba or Nicaragua, which represents 35% of unique encounters
Individuals from Mexico and northern Central America accounted for 58,559 unique encounters in November 2022, which represents 30% of unique encounters and a 14.2% drop from November 2021.  By comparison, Mexicans and Northern Central American migrants accounted for 53% of unique encounters in November 2021.
The Venezuelan Migration Enforcement Process is working:
September 2022 Southwest Land Border (SBO) Venezuelan encounters = 33,804
October 2022 Southwest Land Border (SBO) Venezuelan encounters = 22,045
November 2022 Southwest Land Border (SBO) Venezuelan encounters = 7,931

  CBP Nationwide Total Encounters for FY23TD through November: 283,189
The number of unique individuals encountered nationwide in November 2022 was 204,155, a 4% increase in the number of unique enforcement encounters than the prior month.
In total, there were 233,740 encounters along the southwest land border in November, a 1% increase compared to October. Of those, 16% involved individuals who had at least one prior encounter in the previous 12 months, compared to an average one-year re-encounter rate of 14 percent for FY2014-2019.
Two-thirds (67 percent) of all southwest land border encounters were single adults, with 157,202 encounters in November, a 1.3% decrease compared to October.
66,984 encounters, 29% of the total, were processed for expulsion under Title 42. 166,756 encounters were processed under Title 8.
59,147 encounters involving single adults (38% of all single adult encounters) were processed for expulsion under Title 42, with 98,055 processed under Title 8 (62% of all single adult encounters).
7,674 encounters involving family unit individuals (12% of all family unit individuals) were processed for expulsion under Title 42, with 55,489 processed under Title 8 (88% of all family unit individuals).
Unaccompanied Children
Encounters of unaccompanied children increased 9.4%, with 13,150 encounters in November compared with 12,024 in October. In November, the average number of unaccompanied children in CBP custody was 597 per day, compared with an average of 491 per day in October.
Family Unit individuals
Encounters of family unit individuals increased by 5.6% from 59,805 in October to 63,163 in November —which is a 28% decrease from the peak of 87,461 in August 2021.
Ongoing Migration Management Efforts
CBP continues to enforce U.S. immigration law and apply consequences to those without a legal basis to remain in the U.S. Current restrictions at the U.S. border have not changed; single adults and families encountered at the Southwest border will continue to be expelled, where appropriate, under the CDC’s Title 42 Order. Once the Title 42 public health order is no longer in place, CBP will process individuals encountered at the border without proper travel documents using its longstanding Title 8 authorities.
Under Title 8, those who attempt to enter the United States without authorization, and who are unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States will be quickly removed.  Individuals who have been removed under Title 8 are also subject to additional long-term consequences beyond removal from the United States, including bars to future immigration benefits.
DHS has been executing a comprehensive and deliberate strategy to secure our borders and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system. The strategy is based on six pillars: surging resources; increasing efficiency to reduce strain on the border; employing an aggressive consequence regime; bolstering the capacity of NGOs and partner with state and local partners; going after cartels and smugglers; and working with our regional partners. This comprehensive plan leverages a whole-of-government approach to prepare for and manage the current and anticipated increases in encounters of noncitizens at our Southwest border.
  International Travel and Trade
One of CBP’s core mission objectives is to enhance the nation’s economic prosperity, including through the facilitation of lawful trade and travel. CBP continues to protect America’s national and economic security by facilitating legitimate trade while rigorously enforcing U.S. customs laws and regulations.

Since travel restrictions were eased on November 8, 2021 CBP has processed increased numbers of arriving travelers without any significant delays. The rules allow travelers who are non-U.S. persons to seek to enter the United States for non-essential travel via land ports of entry and ferry terminals, provided they are fully vaccinated and have appropriate documentation. The guidelines also allow most non-immigrants (non-U.S. citizens and other covered persons) who are fully vaccinated to travel by air to the United States, regardless of the reason for travel.
CBP tracks traveler numbers and wait times and continuously adjusts as needed to make the travel experience more efficient. Travelers can plan by doing the following:
Have a valid Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative document, such as a passport, Trusted Traveler Program card, or Enhanced Tribal Card.
Possess proof of an approved COVID-19 vaccination as outlined on the CDC website. 
Verbally attest to their travel intent and COVID-19 vaccination status.
Be prepared to present any documents requested by the CBP officer.

Trade Stats/Seizures – Protecting the American Consumer
CBP works diligently with the trade community and port operators to ensure that merchandise is cleared as efficiently as possible. CBP works with the trade community to strengthen international supply chains and improve border security. There are several programs by which CBP works with importers, carriers, consolidators, licensed customs brokers, and manufacturers to advance information about the shipments and expedite the inspection process at the ports of entry. CBP is available to conduct exams and is ready and willing to expand hours of operations if necessary to meet the growing demand for imported goods.
In November 2022 alone, CBP processed more than 2.7 million entry summaries valued at more than $269 billion, identifying estimated duties of nearly $6.9 billion to be collected by the U.S. government. In November, trade via the ocean environment accounted for more than 40.27% of the total import value, followed by air, truck, and rail.
In November 2022, CBP identified 444 entries valued at more than $128 million for further examination based on the suspected use of forced labor, and which may be subject to a Withhold Release Order, Finding, or the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act’s rebuttable presumption, and prohibited importation into the United States under 19 U.S.C. § 1307.
Intellectual property rights violations continue to put America’s innovation economy at risk. Trade in counterfeit and pirated goods threaten the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, the livelihoods of American workers, and the health and safety of consumers.
In November 2022, CBP seized nearly 1,536 shipments that contained counterfeit goods valued at more than $196 million.
CBP completed 41 audits that identified $1.9 million in duties and fees owed to the U.S. government, stemming from goods that had been improperly declared in accordance with U.S. trade laws and customs regulations.  CBP collected over $5.3 million of this identified revenue and from previous fiscal years’ assignments.
  Drug Seizures
CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and Air and Marine Operations agents continue to interdict the flow of illicit narcotics across the border. Nationwide, drug seizures (Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Heroin, Fentanyl, and Marijuana) by weight were down 5.5% in November compared to October. Seizures were as follows:
Cocaine seizures decreased 8%
Methamphetamine increased 3% 
Heroin seizures increased 52% 
Fentanyl seizures increased 53% 
Additional CBP drug seizure statistics.
  Agriculture Stats/Seizures – Securing American Agriculture
In November 2022, CBP agriculture specialists helped protect America’s agriculture, natural resources, and economic prosperity.
CBP issued 6,597 emergency action notifications for restricted and prohibited plant and animal products entering the United States.
CBP conducted 81,533 positive passenger inspections and issued 601 civil penalties and/or violations to the traveling public for failing to declare prohibited agriculture items.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the comprehensive management, control, and protection of our nation’s borders, combining customs, immigration, border security, and agricultural protection at and between official ports of entry.

Public Safety, Border Security, and Corrections
PROTECTING OUR BORDER AND STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNITIES
For too long, our leaders haven’t been willing to tell the truth and haven’t offered real solutions, which has forced Arizona to continue to bear the brunt of our immigration crisis. Governor Hobbs will use the tools at her disposal to bring resources to our border communities and provide meaningful relief for Arizonans suffering the consequences of decades of federal inaction.
Governor Hobbs knows that our border communities need partnership from the 9th floor. That’s why one of her biggest priorities is communicating with local government officials, law enforcement, community centers, and health care providers to ensure they get the support they need from the state government. 
The Hobbs administration is working to:
Boost funding and Department of Public Safety (DPS) assistance for sheriffs and local law enforcement to ensure they have the necessary intelligence and resources to handle migrant crossings humanely and efficiently.
Make sure Arizonans are getting the care they need by funding community centers and hospitals. Our community centers and hospitals — especially in Yuma, Nogales, Douglas, and Pima County — are overwhelmed. They need additional funding to ensure that nobody is denied care due to a lack of doctors, nurses, and other resources.
Use all the tools at our disposal to increase resources for our border communities and provide meaningful relief for Arizonans suffering the consequences of decades of federal inaction.
Far and away, the most impactful solution to our immigration crisis would be for the federal government to finally pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation that secures our border, strengthens our economy, and provides a tough but fair path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States. An act of Congress is the only way to address the root cause of the problem, rather than relying on the bandaid solutions we’ve been getting for decades.
From modernizing and investing in our ports of entry to addressing labor shortages and ineffective policies, it’s imperative that President Biden and Congress take every step necessary to increase border security and give our border communities the tools they need to keep people safe while expanding legal immigration. Additionally, any comprehensive immigration plan must give DREAMers – young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children – the opportunity to become full American citizens.

Help CBP Protect Intellectual Property Rights
How Recordation Can Help Protect Your Intellectual Property Rights
CBP’s e-Recordation Program Allows Trademark and Copyright Owners to Obtain Border Enforcement of Their Intellectual Property Rights
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has the authority to detain, seize, forfeit, and ultimately destroy merchandise seeking entry into the United States if it bears an infringing trademark or copyright that has been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the U.S. Copyright Office (USCOP), and has subsequently been recorded with CBP. As an intellectual property right (IPR) owner, you can partner with CBP to receive border enforcement of your registered trademarks and copyrights through CBP’s e-Recordation Program.  There are several steps an IPR owner can take to ensure their trademarks and copyrights are enforced at all U.S. Ports of Entry.
STEP 1: Read & Review
Review CBP regulations, 19 C.F.R. Part 133, as well as the following publications which explain in more detail how you can work with CBP to protect your IPR:
CBP Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights – An Informed Compliance Publication
How to Work with CBP to Protect Your Intellectual Property
STEP 2: Record
CBP IPR’s e-Recordation program is administered by the IPR Branch within the Regulations and Rulings Directorate, Office of Trade.  For instructions and access to the online application visit http://iprr.cbp.gov/
Trademarks
You must have a valid trademark registration published on the Principle Register of the USPTO, www.uspto.gov, in order to record with CBP. The fee for e-Recordation is $190 per International Class of Goods (IC).

DHS Announces New Migration Enforcement Process for Venezuelans
Release Date: October 12, 2022
En español
Venezuelans who seek to enter the U.S. illegally will be returned to Mexico; New lawful pathway created for some Venezuelans
WASHINGTON – Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing work to build a fair, orderly, and secure immigration system, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is announcing joint actions with Mexico to reduce the number of people arriving at our Southwest border and create a more orderly and safe process for people fleeing the humanitarian and economic crisis in Venezuela.

Almost four times as many Venezuelans as last year attempted to cross our southern border, placing their lives in the hands of ruthless smuggling organizations. Meanwhile, irregular migration from northern Central America is down by a quarter from the level encountered last year. The actions the United States and Mexico are announcing today are intended to address the most acute irregular migration and help ease pressure on the cities and states receiving these individuals.

Effective immediately, Venezuelans who enter the United States between ports of entry, without authorization, will be returned to Mexico. At the same time, the United States and Mexico are reinforcing their coordinated enforcement operations to target human smuggling organizations and bring them to justice. That campaign will include new migration checkpoints, additional resources and personnel, joint targeting of human smuggling organizations, and expanded information sharing related to transit nodes, hotels, stash houses, and staging locations. The United States is also planning to offer additional security assistance to support regional partners to address the migration challenges in the Darién Gap.

Our comprehensive effort to reduce the irregular migration of Venezuelans also includes a new process to lawfully and safely bring up to 24,000 qualifying Venezuelans into the United States.  The United States will not implement this process without Mexico keeping in place its independent but parallel effort to accept the return of Venezuelan nationals who bypass this process and attempt to enter irregularly.

“These actions make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States, and lawful entry is the only way,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “Those who attempt to cross the southern border of the United States illegally will be returned to Mexico and will be ineligible for this process in the future. Those who follow the lawful process will have the opportunity to travel safely to the United States and become eligible to work here.”

This effort is intended to enhance border security by reducing the number of Venezuelans seeking to irregularly enter the United States. It is derived from the success of the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program, which decreased flows at the border by creating an orderly process for the entry of Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

DHS will closely monitor the implementation of this process, and Mexico’s independent and parallel efforts, and may consider expanding it in the future.

To be eligible, Venezuelans must:
have a supporter in the United States who will provide financial and other support;
pass rigorous biometric and biographic national security and public safety screening and vetting; and
complete vaccinations and other public health requirements.
Venezuelans are ineligible if they:
have been ordered removed from the United States in the previous five years;
have crossed without authorization between ports of entry after the date of announcement;
have irregularly entered Mexico or Panama after the date of announcement, or are a permanent resident or dual national of any country other than Venezuela, or currently hold refugee status in any country; or
have not completed vaccinations and other public health requirements.
Venezuelans should not travel to Mexico to pursue entry into the United States.  

Venezuelans approved via this process will be authorized on a case-by-case basis to travel to the United States by air directly to an interior port of entry, thus relieving pressure at the border.  Once in the United States, they will be eligible to apply for work authorization.

DHS will administer the process, working with communities and other partners. Any U.S.-based individual with lawful status, including representatives of businesses or other organizations or entities, can support a potential beneficiary from Venezuela. A supporter must prove that they have the means to provide financial and other support for the beneficiary. In the coming days, potential supporters can apply to DHS to support individual eligible Venezuelans via www.uscis.gov/Venezuela. Individuals and representatives of organizations seeking to apply as a supporter must declare the organization’s financial support and they must pass security background checks to protect against exploitation and abuse.  

The State Department will also engage in a robust in-region messaging campaign to communicate about this new process and the consequences of attempting irregular entry.

More information will be available at www.uscis.gov/Venezuela in the coming days.

Today’s actions are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s ongoing efforts to reduce irregular migration throughout the Western Hemisphere, including through the U.S. Strategy for Addressing the Root Causes of Migration and the multinational Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. The process announced today is one more element of the United States’ multilateral approach to addressing irregular migration that is impacting countries throughout Latin America, and it is premised on pairing increased enforcement in response to irregular immigration with the development of lawful and safe pathways for qualifying individuals. 

Venezuelans have been migrating throughout the hemisphere since approximately 2014, yet the level of irregular migration of Venezuelans has increased dramatically throughout the hemisphere in the past several years. There are currently 2.4 million Venezuelans residing in Colombia. More than 25% of Venezuela’s population has left the country.  The United States is seeing a rising rate of Venezuelans encountered at our border over the past two years, which has surged in the last few months. Average monthly unique encounters of Venezuelan nationals at the land border totaled 15,494 in FY 2022, rising further to over 25,000 in August and 33,000 in September, compared to a monthly average of 127 unique encounters from FY 2014–2019.   Of note, unique encounters of Venezuelan nationals rose 293 percent between FY 2021 and FY 2022, while unique encounters of all other nationalities combined increased 45 percent. Panama is currently seeing more than 3,000 people, mostly Venezuelan nationals, crossing into its territory from Colombia via the Darién jungle each day.

The United States, in partnership with Mexico, also is committing to further expanding lawful labor pathways for Mexican and Northern Central American nationals. This last year, the United States doubled the number of H-2 visas issued to nationals of the Northern Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Today, we are announcing the largest H-2B supplemental in history for Fiscal Year 2023: nearly 65,000 new H-2B visas, including a set-aside of 20,000 to nationals of Northern Central American countries and Haiti.  Historically, approximately 90% of these visas have been used by Mexican nationals.  This increase is coupled with strong measures to protect both U.S. and H-2B workers. Concurrent with this announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching a White House-led Worker Protection Task Force to ensure ethical recruitment and dignified labor standards for foreign workers alongside protections for U.S. workers.  

The United States also is renewing its commitment to tackle the root causes of migration and support countries in the region that are most impacted by these flows. For that reason, the United States has announced nearly $817 million in new assistance since September 2022 under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. This includes more than $240 million in new regional humanitarian and security assistance, $376 million in additional humanitarian assistance for people affected by the Venezuela regional crisis, and more than $199 million in additional humanitarian assistance for Mexico and Central America.

Homeland Security Task Force Southeast partners increase illegal migration enforcement patrols in Florida Straits, Caribbean
Home | News & Events | Homeland Security Task Force Southeast partners increase illegal migration enforcement patrols in Florida Straits, Caribbean
Great Seal of the United States
MIAMI — Homeland Security Task Force – Southeast enhanced its operational posture and readiness to address a recent increase in irregular maritime migration originating from the Bahamas and Cuba through the Florida Straits, from Haiti through the Windward Pass, and from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico through the Mona Pass.
Task Force partners are increasing patrols and enforcement by land, air and sea, day and night.
HSTF-SE is a Department of Homeland Security-led, standing interagency task force responsible for deterring, preventing, and responding to illegal maritime migration under Operation Vigilant Sentry. The primary objectives of the Task Force are to prevent loss of life at sea and to deter and dissuade maritime migration using DHS forces, reinforced by other federal, state, and local assets and capabilities.
“Illegal maritime voyages in the Caribbean are always dangerous and very often deadly,” said Rear Adm. Brendan C. McPherson, Commander, Seventh Coast Guard District and Director, HSTF-SE. “Smugglers routinely exploit vulnerable migrants for profit while putting their lives at risk aboard overloaded and unseaworthy vessels. These dangerous voyages must not be attempted. Safe, legal, and orderly migration saves lives.”
OVS is HSTF-SE’s comprehensive, integrated, national operational plan for a rapid, effective, and unified response of federal, state, and local capabilities in response to maritime migration in the Caribbean. OVS describes the basic organization and structure by which the Task Force will deploy resources and coordinate multi-agency operations to address illegal maritime migration patterns in the Southeast region of North America. The plan allows for the task force to adjust resources and posture as necessary based upon illegal maritime migration trends.
“The U.S. Border Patrol Miami Sector is committed to working alongside our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners in a whole-of-government effort to prepare for and address any potential increases in irregular maritime migration or border security threats in Florida,” said Walter N. Slosar, Chief Patrol Agent for Border Patrol Miami Sector and deputy director, HSTF-SE.
The Coast Guard and federal partners maintain a continual presence with land, air and sea assets in the Florida Straits and in the Caribbean Sea, as part of a multi-layered approach to interdict migrants attempting to enter the U.S. Those without a legal basis in the United States will be removed.
In 2003, the DHS established HSTF-SE for the purpose of responding to maritime migration events in the Caribbean. The Task Force provides the organizational framework to detect maritime migration indicators, monitor maritime migration trends, and conduct joint training, exercises, and planning. Members of the Task Force include the U.S. Coast Guard, the departments of Defense, State, Justice, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Secret Service, and state and local agencies including representatives from FDEM, FDLE, Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties.
HSTF-SE represents an all-of-government approach. CBP-AMO officers embarked on aircraft and boats work alongside Coast Guard units to detect and interdict illegal maritime migrant ventures. CBP-OFO officers and USBP agents coordinate efforts with maritime branches to detect and interdict migrants who land on Florida beaches and U.S. islands and territories in the Caribbean. HSI special agents specifically target individuals who are involved in human smuggling events and investigate the transnational criminal organizations that profit from these illegal activities. U.S. Public Health Service officers from the ICE Health Service Corps Special Operations Unit work with the Coast Guard and provide medical care to migrants on board Coast Guard vessels and treat any immediate needs.
The Coast Guard is simultaneously a federal law enforcement agency and a branch of the military. Among its 11 statutory missions, the Coast Guard is charged with the enforcement of U.S. immigration law and U.S. government policy to secure our maritime borders and prevent illegal migration attempts by sea. People trying to enter the country illegally by sea will be interdicted and repatriated to their country of origin or the country they departed from, consistent with U.S. law, policies, and international treaty obligations.

PRESS RELEASE
Fentanyl Seizures at Border Continue to Spike, Making San Diego a National Epicenter for Fentanyl Trafficking; U.S. Attorney’s Office Prioritizes Prosecutions and Prevention Programs
Thursday, August 11, 2022

For Immediate Release
U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of California
Assistant U. S. Attorney Adam Gordon (619) 546-6720
NEWS RELEASE SUMMARY – August 12, 2022
SAN DIEGO – More deadly fentanyl is being seized by border officials in San Diego and Imperial counties than at any of the nation’s 300-plus ports of entry, making this federal district an epicenter for fentanyl trafficking into the United States.
In the first nine months of FY 2022 (October through June), U.S. Customs and Border Protection law enforcement agencies in San Diego and Imperial counties (CBP Field Operations and Border Patrol) seized 5,091 pounds of fentanyl – which amounts to about 60 percent of the 8,425 pounds of fentanyl seized around the entire country.

These fentanyl seizures in San Diego by CBP include land ports of entry at San Ysidro, Otay Mesa, Tecate, Andrade and Calexico. Seizures by Border Patrol stations within the San Diego Sector include Imperial Beach, Chula Vista, Brown Field, El Cajon, Campo, Boulevard, San Clemente and Murietta.  In addition, seizures by the Border Patrol in the Imperial Valley include El Centro and Calexico.
Mexican cartels are increasingly manufacturing fentanyl for distribution and sale in the United States Precursors are imported from China and other countries and then pressed into pills, powder or mixed into other drugs at massive, industrial-scale labs.
Initially, drug trafficking organizations were adding small amounts of fentanyl to large loads of other drugs like methamphetamine. But more recently, these criminal organizations are moving significantly larger quantities of fentanyl pills and powder across the border. In a recent six-day period, CBP and Border Patrol intercepted four separate vehicle loads of fentanyl weighing between 100 and 250 pounds from July 13 to 18 in Campo and Calexico.

“A decade ago, we didn’t even know about fentanyl, and now it’s a national crisis,” said U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman. “The amount of fentanyl we are seizing at the border is staggering. The number of fentanyl seizures and fentanyl-related deaths in our district are unprecedented.”
According to statistics released by the San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office, fentanylrelated overdose deaths have increased 2,375 percent in San Diego County, from 33 in 2016 to at least 817 in 2021. The total may increase as the Medical Examiner’s Office makes final determinations in causes of death.
According to CBP, seizures of fentanyl in San Diego are up by approximately 323 percent in the last three years, from just 1,599 pounds in FY 2019 to 6,767 in FY 2021. With three months to go in FY 2022, seizures in San Diego in FY 2022 are on pace to meet or exceed 2021 levels.
In Imperial County, seizures of fentanyl increased 272 percent from FY 2019 to FY 2022, from 40 pounds to 149 pounds – with three months still to count in FY 2022.
Please see the following video messages by U.S. Attorney Grossman; Anne Maricich, acting Director of Field Operations for the San Diego Field Office; San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Aaron M. Heitke;  El Centro Chief Patrol Agent Greg Bovino; HSI San Diego Special Agent in Charge Chad Plantz; and Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy of the FBI’s San Diego Field Office: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGvHJHdPh24UtqMDDnr080IE66OTl8NxgLinks to other government and non-government sites will typically appear with the “external link” icon to indicate that you are leaving the Department of Justice website when you click the link.
“U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in the San Diego Field Office have the arduous task of sifting through 150,000 northbound travelers every day to find those conducting illegal activity, including narcotics smuggling,” said Anne Maricich, acting Director of Field Operations for the San Diego Field Office.  “Drug trafficking organizations will use anyone they can to help them with their dangerous and illegal activities, including regular border crossers as well as teens in the hopes that they won’t arouse suspicion.  CBP is committed to keeping this dangerous drug from reaching our communities.”
“2016 was the first year San Diego Sector Border Patrol tracked fentanyl seizures,” said San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Aaron M. Heitke. “In that year, our sector seized a total of 71 pounds. This fiscal year to date, San Diego Sector has already seized over 600 pounds, an increase of 745 percent, with two months remaining in the fiscal year. We will continue to work with our National and International partners to dismantle these criminal organizations and keep our borders free of these nefarious actors.”
“Fentanyl is dangerous on all levels: To our Border Patrol Agents and CBP Officers working hard to interdict this dangerous toxin, as well as to the general public who too often meet a tragic end,” said El Centro Chief Patrol Agent Greg Bovino. “With a concerted effort between law enforcement, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the public, we can stop fentanyl smuggling and protect our communities.”
“Fentanyl is an extremely dangerous narcotic that kills indiscriminately,” said HSI San Diego Special Agent in Charge Chad Plantz. “Fentanyl is not the type of drug you experiment with, and it is only a matter of time before drug users consume a fatal dose. This deadly drug does not discriminate nor do the transnational criminal organizations (TCO) who smuggle this dangerous drug. These TCOs have no regard for the lives taken and the violence created by this illegal enterprise. HSI is committed to preventing this drug from entering our communities and destroying lives and devastating families. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners and prioritize investigations targeting the drug cartels who are smuggling fentanyl into the United States and bring to justice any organization or individuals who seek to profit off the sale of this dangerous narcotic.”
“There is no doubt we are in the middle of a fentanyl crisis at the hands of criminal enterprises, transcending our borders into the communities where we live, where we work, where we go to school,” said Special Agent in Charge Stacey Moy of the FBI’s San Diego Field Office. “The FBI’s mission is to protect the American people and we will apply the full force of the FBI behind investigating those criminal enterprises to stop the influx of illicit fentanyl into San Diego. We are dedicated to eliminating this threat where it begins, and will devote all necessary resources and personnel, while working alongside our law enforcement partners, to ensure justice is served and our communities are safe.”
“Air and Marine Operations will continue to work with our federal, local, state and international partners to provide air and marine capabilities along our borders to interdict fentanyl loads that are being brought into the United States by criminal organizations who have no regard for the implications of such a lethal drug,” said Brandon Tucker, director of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection San Diego Air and Marine Branch. 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, which is responsible for enforcing federal criminal laws in San Diego and Imperial counties, is employing a dual strategy of prosecution and prevention. Regarding the former, the office has prioritized and significantly increased the number of fentanyl-related prosecutions. There has been an approximately 1,600 percent increase in the number of people charged with fentanyl-related crimes over the last five years. These include numerous successful prosecutions of dealers who distribute fentanyl resulting in someone’s death. Those charges carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
“We continue to work with our law enforcement partners to pursue justice for the victims who die as a result of fentanyl trafficking and to prosecute the people responsible for this crisis - from the Mexican drug cartel leadership, to the couriers, to the street dealers who distribute the fatal doses,” Grossman said.
The strategy for combatting the crisis cannot be limited to prosecutions. Law enforcement agencies, including federal, state and local partners, must continue to lead on education and other prevention efforts. For example, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which holds a leadership role in the county’s opioid coalition, has been a driving force behind the creation of a fentanyl tool kit that provides critical information to the public on fentanyl dangers.

In addition, the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Outreach Team is available to provide presentations to any audience. Interested groups can arrange a fentanyl presentation by contacting cindy.cipriani@usdoj.gov or shastity.urias@usdoj.gov. 
Grossman also noted that the Administration’s National Drug Control Strategy focuses on two critical drivers of the epidemic: untreated addiction and drug trafficking. “Our office is taking a 360-degree approach to the fentanyl crisis. We are prioritizing actions that will save lives, promoting grant opportunities, working with partners to get people the care they need, going after drug traffickers’ profits, and making better use of data to guide all these efforts.” See National Drug Control Strategy, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/National-Drug-Control-2022Strategy.pdfLinks to other government and non-government sites will typically appear with the “external link” icon to indicate that you are leaving the Department of Justice website when you click the link..
We need help from everyone in the community to be educated on the dangers of fentanyl. “Prevention is key to stopping the death toll,” Grossman said.  “Parents need to talk with their kids about fentanyl. 
A tiny amount will kill, and people are overdosing by accident, with many unaware that they are even taking fentanyl. No drug is safe in this era. Do not experiment with any illicit drug, because it might contain fentanyl. And it just might be the last thing you do.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office, together with several federal law enforcement partners, has created a poster that will be hung at the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa ports of entry, warning would-be smugglers and distributors of fentanyl of stiff consequences if their actions lead to deadly overdose. “YOUR FENTANYL KILLS,” the poster says in both English and Spanish. “Distribution of Fentanyl (pills or powder) resulting in death or serious bodily injury carries a mandatory sentence of 20 years in federal prison. YOU PAY THE PRICE!”
On August 31, the U.S. Attorney and other law enforcement officials will observe International Overdose Awareness Day, the world’s largest annual campaign to end overdose and remember those who have died and acknowledge the grief of the family and friends left behind. The campaign raises awareness of overdose - one of the world’s worst public health crises - and stimulates action and discussion about evidence-based overdose prevention and drug policy.

Key Points and Practical Advice
In February 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that the China Initiative, launched in November 2018 to counter perceived threats to U.S. national security from China, was “not the right approach.”1 Nonetheless, the Biden administration continues to pursue China-related enforcement actions, including with respect to alleged trade secret theft as well as alleged sanctions and export controls violations.
Facing investigation obstacles including several Chinese blocking statutes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may change its enforcement strategy in China-related matters by pursuing charges that do not require it to establish fraud and/or by relying more on evidence it is able to collect from sources outside of China. Meanwhile, the SEC has listed more than 150 issuers that do not comply with the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA) and has strengthened disclosure requirements for China-based variable interest entity (VIE) structures.
Recent People’s Republic of China (PRC) blocking statutes and laws on cyber and data security and privacy have made cross-border enforcement more challenging.
Given the current state of U.S.-China relations and a number of complicated new laws in both countries, companies should establish transparent and credible internal compliance processes to help ensure that they meet U.S. and Chinese legal requirements. For example:

When making strategic decisions, companies should be proactive in assessing legal and compliance risks and potential conflicts under both U.S. and Chinese regulatory regimes, instead of reacting to issues when they arise.
To avoid being caught between conflicting regulatory regimes, companies may consider urging U.S. and Chinese regulators to talk among themselves, rather than serving as a go-between.
Credibility and process matter. For example, if PRC blocking statutes inhibit the SEC’s ability to conduct its own investigations, it may seek to rely more heavily on reviews done by the company’s internal audit team or outside counsel and other sources of information. Companies should implement and maintain internal processes that the SEC can trust.
Both the U.S. and Chinese authorities recently have taken significant actions relating to cross-border enforcement involving China. On the U.S. side, the DOJ continues to investigate and prosecute alleged trade secret theft as well as alleged sanctions and export controls violations, while the SEC has focused on issues related to the HFCAA and VIE structures. On the Chinese side, the PRC government has passed various blocking statutes and data privacy laws that have made U.S. cross-border enforcement efforts more challenging. Companies that do business in both countries thus need a plan to navigate between these sometimes conflicting regulatory regimes.
Recent DOJ Enforcement Trends Regarding China
DOJ’s Shift Away From the China Initiative
In November 2018, the DOJ launched the China Initiative, an effort to identify and investigate economic espionage and trade secret theft intended to benefit the Chinese state. Under the Initiative’s umbrella, federal prosecutors also brought a number of cases charging academics and researchers with fraud and false statements to federal agencies for allegedly misrepresenting their ties to the Chinese government. In February 2022, Matthew G. Olsen, the assistant attorney general (AAG) in charge of the DOJ’s National Security Division (NSD), acknowledged that to many, the China Initiative “fueled a narrative of intolerance and bias,” suggesting “that the Justice Department treats people from China or of Chinese descent differently.”2 At the same time, Mr. Olsen asserted that the Chinese government continued to pose a national security threat to U.S. interests. He announced that, going forward, the Justice Department would apply the broader Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats to potential threats from countries such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. During a July 28, 2022, hearing before the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Olsen reiterated the department’s commitment to the Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats, noting that the NSD is particularly focused on cyber-enabled attacks and other nation-state attacks and that the NSD is “most concerned of China and Russia, and also Iran and North Korea.”3
While some interpreted Mr. Olsen’s February 2022 speech as a repudiation of the China Initiative, the shift away from the China Initiative does not mean that the Biden administration is relaxing its enforcement of perceived threats from China. The DOJ has continued to pursue many cases originally brought under the China Initiative, including those involving alleged fraud and false statements. That said, future enforcement will likely prioritize alleged trade secret theft and export controls violations over alleged grant fraud and false statements. Other enforcement and regulatory authorities also will use all available tools, and existing mechanisms such as Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) reviews will not be affected. Companies and individuals operating in China would be well-advised to stay vigilant and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
PRC Talent Programs
The DOJ also has been active in bringing criminal charges against individuals who allegedly lie about receiving money from the PRC or about their affiliations with the PRC. Many of those cases involve defendants’ participation in PRC talent recruitment programs like the Thousand Talents Program, which is not itself illegal. However, the DOJ scrutinizes these programs closely because it views them as a way to recruit individuals with access to U.S. government-funded research for the PRC’s benefit.
Companies may face reputational risks and may find themselves having to incur substantial legal expenses in defending themselves against investigations if they are seen by the U.S. authorities as facilitating employee cooperation in PRC talent programs perceived to threaten U.S. national security interests. If companies lie about or omit information on this participation, they may face potential legal liability, including criminal liability. Companies should always comply with U.S. laws and regulations, maintain accurate books and records, and ensure that any responses to U.S. government inquiries are truthful and complete. At the same time, companies also may be well-advised to inform their employees of their right to seek counsel or remain silent when questioned under certain circumstances, such as at border crossings, and to decline to give consent for searches of their persons or possessions.
In addition, companies should assess what data they should store in the United States, as opposed to in the PRC, and vice versa, and be careful about data transfers between the two jurisdictions that may raise issues under PRC data and cybersecurity laws and the U.S. Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act). Companies should also be mindful of the protections offered by attorney-client privilege to the extent that they are seeking advice from U.S. counsel.
Sanctions and Export Controls
Sanctions and export controls are top priorities for DOJ enforcement. On June 16, 2022, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco publicly described sanctions as “the new FCPA” (the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and remarked that “[t]he growth of sanctions enforcement follows the path that the FCPA traveled before it,” thus implying that the DOJ expects sanctions enforcement to be very active in the future, as FCPA enforcement has been for some time.4 In addition, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently called out Chinese companies perceived to be seeking to undermine sanctions with Russia and discussed working toward transitioning supply chains to trusted nations.5 Recent high-profile sanctions enforcement actions include an August 2021 case brought by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) against Bank of China’s U.K. subsidiary, resulting in a $2.3 million settlement regarding alleged violations of the Sudan sanctions program through processing payments.6
The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security recently announced a three-part strategy for enforcing export controls including fines, public disclosure and requiring settling companies to publicly admit to misconduct.7 In May 2022, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced a collaboration with the Department of Commerce on strengthening export controls.8 Recent civil export controls actions include the Commerce Department’s issuance of a temporary denial order against three U.S. 3D printing companies, suspending their export privileges for 180 days.9 According to the Commerce Department, the companies had exported controlled technology from the United States to China for 3D printing purposes without the required authorization from the U.S. government or consent from the companies’ clients.
Recent SEC Enforcement Trends Regarding China
SEC Cross-Border Enforcement Strategy Post-Luckin Coffee
The SEC enforcement action against Luckin Coffee in December 2020 was viewed as groundbreaking for several reasons, including the size of the settlement related to a China-based issuer ($180 million in penalties), the swiftness of the investigation and the cooperation between the SEC and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).10
Although the SEC has opened numerous investigations related to China-based issuers in the intervening years, the agency faces significant obstacles, including PRC blocking statutes that make it more difficult to obtain information from China and hamper its ability to conduct those investigations. These developments will continue to have a practical effect on the SEC’s cross-border enforcement strategy. The SEC likely will focus on collecting evidence from sources outside of China, such as third parties involved in initial public offerings, short-seller research firms and whistleblowers. In addition, the SEC may find it more expedient to pursue nonfraud charges against alleged wrongdoers, such as accounting or internal controls violations, rather than fraud cases, which typically depend on evidence of intent that are based on proof obtained through internal communications and witness testimony.
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
In December 2020, Congress passed the HFCAA, which directs the SEC to prohibit securities of a registrant from being listed on a U.S. exchange if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) determines that it was unable to inspect the auditor of the registrant’s financial statements for three consecutive years. Legislation pending in the U.S. Congress could shorten this time frame to two years.11
The PCAOB has identified firms that it has not been able to inspect, and the SEC has listed on its website over 150 issuers that it views as potentially out of compliance with U.S. regulations as of July 29, 2022.12 Some media reports suggest that U.S. and PRC authorities may be attempting to resolve these problems, but YJ Fischer, director of the SEC’s Office of International Affairs, recently commented that “significant issues remain and time is quickly running out[.]”13 Additionally, the HFCAA has given rise to a great deal of uncertainty around the adequacy of the disclosures that companies have made and must continue to make.
Variable Interest Entities
PRC regulations prohibit or restrict foreign investment in Chinese companies operating in certain sensitive industries, including media and telecommunications. To comply with these regulations, many China-based issuers have formed foreign holding companies to enter into contractual arrangements with Chinese operating companies. Under the contractual arrangements, these China-based issuers control, and become the primary beneficiaries of, the Chinese operating companies.
The SEC views the VIE structure as potentially raising transparency issues. The SEC has instructed its staff to look through the VIE structure to assess true ownership and control, and to require disclosures for U.S. investors. In July 2021, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler raised concerns over China-based VIE structures’ impact on U.S. investors, and he asked the SEC staff to seek certain disclosures from such entities before the registration for the issuer is declared effective.14 Additionally, in December 2021, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance released a “sample letter” operationalizing some of Chairman Gensler’s concerns, including the areas of disclosure.15 The SEC will likely continue to dig under complex legal structures to require compliance with U.S. laws, including the HFCAA.
New Chinese Legal Regime for Cross-Border Enforcement
Recent PRC Laws Impacting Cross-Border Enforcement
A number of PRC laws that have made cross-border enforcement efforts more challenging recently came into force. These laws include two blocking statutes, which appear to have been passed largely in response to U.S. Congress’ enactment of the CLOUD Act requiring overseas companies registered in the U.S. to cooperate with law enforcement by sharing data: the International Criminal Judicial Assistance Law (ICJA Law), mostly affecting DOJ investigations; and Article 177 of the revised PRC Securities Law (Article 177), mostly affecting SEC investigations.
The ICJA Law, enacted in October 2018, prohibits individuals and organizations in China from providing any evidence or assistance to foreign criminal authorities without first receiving prior approval from the Chinese authorities. Enacted in December 2019, Article 177 stipulates that no Chinese entity or individual may transmit any securities-related documents or information outside of China without the approval of the relevant Chinese authorities.
There are also three PRC laws on cyber and data security and protecting personal information: the Cybersecurity Law, which establishes a comprehensive framework for data protection and network security; the Data Security Law (DSL), which sets up a framework to classify data collected and stored in China based on its potential impact on Chinese data security; and the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which establishes strict requirements for data handlers operating in China collecting personal data on individuals.
Questions for Companies To Consider When Facing Conflicts Between US and PRC Legal Regimes
When does a foreign investigation become criminal or securities-related? The nature of the investigation, whether criminal or civil, determines which blocking statutes apply and which PRC government agencies U.S. authorities should inform. The distinction between a criminal investigation and a securities-related investigation is not always clear, however. For example, an initial investigation conducted by the SEC could be purely civil in nature, but criminal authorities, such as the DOJ, may become involved in the background with no indication to a company that there is an ongoing criminal investigation. In addition, Chinese companies may need to decide when and to which PRC authorities to report when they receive requests from self-regulatory organizations, such as the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which tend to work closely with the SEC.
Will self-reporting to U.S. regulators (to claim cooperation credit) violate PRC laws? The decision of whether to self-report violations to U.S. regulators is particularly complex for China-based companies given the PRC’s new laws concerning the protection of sensitive data. On the one hand, reporting infractions may risk running afoul of PRC prohibitions on transporting certain data under the DSL and the PIPL. On the other hand, companies that choose not to report may risk increased penalties from U.S. regulators. It may be more efficient and productive to try to put the onus on the regulators to talk among themselves, rather than having the company serve as a go-between.

STATE MAP ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT
State Map on Immigration Enforcement
In recent years, sanctuary policies have increasingly become a political, legal, and narrative battle between those who seek to protect the rights of immigrants and communities of color and those who oppose them. The federal government has built a massive infrastructure that exploits state and local resources in the name of detaining and deporting immigrants. In response, state legislatures and governors across the country have had a crucial choice: pass sanctuary policies to protect their residents, pass anti-immigrant policies that harm residents, or do nothing. Through all this, activists have strategized and rallied others to their cause, courts have upheld or struck down pieces of legislation, and millions of lives have been irrevocably impacted.
This map focuses on state laws that regulate the state’s involvement in immigration enforcement. Sanctuary policies take many forms, but broadly act to limit the participation of state or local agencies with detention and deportation. Anti-sanctuary laws are intentionally anti-immigrant: some prohibit local governments from enacting sanctuary policies, and some mandate specific assistance to ICE. The map looks at what these policies do, where they are, where they aren’t, and what is left open.
  For larger version of the map, click here.
The map represents the degree to which state policies limit or expand involvement in immigration enforcement, based on an analysis of current state laws and any litigation impacting state laws, as well as our own expertise in state and local laws and policies relating to immigration enforcement. It shows which states have gone the furthest in passing legislation that protects their communities, which have made significant steps, which have done nothing, which have prevented their localities from taking protective measures, and which have actively passed laws to collude with ICE in ways that significantly harm their residents.
We update the map regularly as the laws shift and grow.
Some states are clear leaders in offering protections for their immigrant residents and residents of color that are disproportionately harmed by biased policing, imprisonment, and deportation. States that have not enacted any laws regarding immigration enforcement are nonetheless often providing unnecessary, sometimes illegal, assistance to ICE. Some states have gone to the other extreme, placing their communities at risk. They have passed laws punishing their own localities for passing sanctuary policies and undermined the impact of these protective policies. Some have also passed even more expansive, discriminatory and harmful policies that attempt to force state and local law enforcement to essentially become a de facto arm of the federal detention and deportation system. While some aspects of these policies have been struck down by federal courts, others remain.
  Explanation of Methodology and Legend
For this map, we analyzed 50 states and the federal District of Columbia for state sanctuary-related laws across 15 parameters. These parameters fell into four general categories:  information and resource sharing with ICE, jail-to-ICE transfers, patrol officer collusion with ICE, and contracts with ICE or CBP. For explanation of these categories and the individual parameters, see The Appendix. States were given a numerical score ranging from 1-5 for each parameter, with “1” the most harmful and “5” the most protective. We also analyzed how litigation has changed the impact of state legislation. States that had passed laws that would have given them a score of “1” for most harmful were changed to “2” or somewhat harmful where successful litigation resulted in striking down or mitigating the harmful impact of the legislation. Where state laws simply reiterated federal laws that harm immigrants, we also gave them a “2” or somewhat harmful designation. On the pro-sanctuary side, states that passed strong protective policies were given a “5” as most protective; those that had significant carve-outs or exceptions to these policies were given a “4” as somewhat protective. States that have no legislation or didn’t address a specific parameter were given a not applicable (“n/a”) score of “3”.  
When averaged across all the parameters, two states had particularly strong and comprehensive laws protecting immigrants, and fell into the most protective category: Oregon and Illinois. 
Three other states also have broad sanctuary statutes: New Jersey, California, and Washington.  Colorado, Maryland, Vermont, and Connecticut have also enacted laws against their involvement in immigration enforcement.  New York and Rhode Island have taken some small steps toward reducing immigration enforcement.  On the other side, several states have enacted laws mandating some participation in immigration enforcement by local agencies: Arizona, Montana, Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Georgia, North Dakota, North Carolina, and Indiana.  A handful of states have fairly broad anti-sanctuary laws with significant negative effects for their immigrant residents: South Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, Idaho and Alabama.  And four states have particularly aggressive and comprehensive anti-sanctuary laws that force local agencies to be involved in deporting their constituents: Florida, Texas, West Virginia and Iowa.  Although a number of these anti-sanctuary laws have been sharply limited by federal court decisions, many of their impacts remain in effect.  
The focus of this map is on state legislation, rather than executive orders, court decisions unrelated to litigation, or other non-legislative policies. We made two exceptions for New Jersey and Rhode Island. Because the New Jersey Constitution and its Criminal Justice Act provide for the Attorney General to direct all law enforcement and prosecuting agencies operating under the authority of the laws of the state, the Attorney General Law Enforcement Directive has expansive impact akin to legislation and was treated as such in our map. Rhode Island operates a unified correctional system whereby the Governor’s Executive Order directing its Department of Corrections impacts the only jail and prison in the state and was also treated as akin to legislation.   
The map does not include or analyze immigration-related state laws that are not focused on immigration enforcement, such as funds for immigration legal services, access to drivers’ licenses for undocumented immigrants, in-state tuition for undocumented students, state benefits afforded to non-citizens, etc.
  The Impacts of State Immigration Laws
As the map shows, we are at a precipice for which way our country will go. If states are laboratories for democracy, we can see the different possibilities before us and what they mean to all of our communities.
States are closely divided between protective laws (12 states with a combined population of 112 million people) and harmful laws (18 states with a combined population of 127 million people), with 24 states that have not yet passed sanctuary or anti-sanctuary policies (with a combined population of 93 million people). More foreign born residents are impacted by states with protective laws (23 million people) vs states with harmful laws (14 million people), with 8 million people residing in states that have passed no laws on immigration.   
These numbers represent real people’s lives, but they are just a rough approximation that does not speak to the broader impacts of these policies, nor to how carefully the laws are actually followed. But we know that overpoliced, vulnerable populations are better integrated, more secure, and more involved in their communities when local law enforcement agents are not involved in deportations. Their children are less likely to live in fear of losing a parent, mental health is improved, and access to justice is protected, while crime rates continue to fall. Until our federal lawmakers gather the political will to end the tyranny of our detention and deportation machine, the ILRC will continue to advise advocates, law enforcement, and elected officials across the nation on how to enact and improve sanctuary policies to protect our communities.
  Further Background
Local involvement in immigration enforcement makes local agencies the gateway to deportation, co-opts local resources into questionable, racially discriminatory purposes, strips communities of any sense of safety, and undermines the rule of law.
There is no federal legal obligation for state and local jurisdictions to use their resources to help with immigration enforcement. But historically police and sheriff’s departments have often voluntarily assisted ICE, without even considering the legality or ramifications of their actions.
In recent years, following widespread advocacy and federal court rulings that ICE detainers (requests to have an individual held for transfer directly from local custody to immigration detention) are unconstitutional, hundreds of counties and cities stopped complying with these requests. And many have gone much further in shielding their local resources from entanglement in immigration enforcement. However, the majority of counties have still not caught on to the legal jeopardy they face by complying with ICE detainers, nor recognized the horrific implications for their immigrant residents. 
ILRC maintains a map of county-level policies on involvement with ICE here: www.ilrc.org/local-enforcement-map.
Amidst the controversy over Secure Communities and the refusal of many localities to transfer their residents to ICE , some politicians and pundits began using sanctuary policies as a scapegoat for all of society’s ills. Donald Trump made attacking sanctuary policies one of the cornerstones of his 2016 campaign and a key domestic policy priority for his administration. Prior to Donald Trump, Arizona and a few other copycat states passed expansive “show me your papers” anti-sanctuary legislation, essentially forcing its state and local law enforcement to act as an arm of federal immigration enforcement (which even the federal government at the time opposed). While the Supreme Court and other federal courts have struck down many of the unconstitutional aspects of these laws, other insidious provisions remained. More recent waves of anti-sanctuary legislation have skirted the provisions originally struck down by the courts, but added new harmful measures restricting localities from passing sanctuary policies and increasing other aspects of collusion between state and local law enforcement and ICE. 
At the same time, states like Washington and California have led the way on enacting protective laws, and most recently, Illinois and Oregon have shown what truly expansive protective policies can offer their residents. At the ILRC, we have seen tremendous success of sanctuary policies that disentangle local law enforcement from ICE, and we continue to craft, support, and advocate for those initiatives nationwide.

Immigration Enforcement
Immigration enforcement is the largest single area of responsibility for ICE. While certain responsibilities and working closely with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and others require significant ICE assets near the border, the majority of immigration enforcement work for ICE takes place in the country’s interior.
ICE special agents aim to help businesses secure a lawful workforce and enforce immigration laws against those who encourage and rely on unauthorized workers, sometimes taking advantage of their situation to offer low pay and poor conditions.
Multiple programs help ICE focus and improve on stated priorities to find and remove illegal aliens who are criminals, fugitives or recent arrivals. Immigration enforcement includes cracking down on those who produce fraudulent documents to allow unlawful activity. Additionally, several efforts seek to continue improving the safe and humane detention and removal of persons subject to those actions.

Immigration Enforcement
Immigration enforcement is the largest single area of responsibility for ICE. While certain responsibilities and working closely with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and others require significant ICE assets near the border, the majority of immigration enforcement work for ICE takes place in the country’s interior.
ICE special agents aim to help businesses secure a lawful workforce and enforce immigration laws against those who encourage and rely on unauthorized workers, sometimes taking advantage of their situation to offer low pay and poor conditions.
Multiple programs help ICE focus and improve on stated priorities to find and remove illegal aliens who are criminals, fugitives or recent arrivals. Immigration enforcement includes cracking down on those who produce fraudulent documents to allow unlawful activity. Additionally, several efforts seek to continue improving the safe and humane detention and removal of persons subject to those actions.

Priority Enforcement Program
Archived Content
In an effort to keep ICE.gov current, the archive contains content from a previous administration or is otherwise outdated. This information is archived and not reflective of current practice.
Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) was U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) program from 2015 to 2017. This content is now archived. Read more about the program's history below.
The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) enables DHS to work with state and local law enforcement to take custody of individuals who pose a danger to public safety before those individuals are released into our communities. PEP was established at the direction of former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in a November 20, 2014 memorandum, entitled Secure Communities, that discontinued the Secure Communities program. PEP focuses on convicted criminals and others who pose a danger to public safety.
How it Works
PEP begins at the state and local level when an individual is arrested and booked by a law enforcement officer for a criminal violation and his or her fingerprints are submitted to the FBI for criminal history and warrant checks. This same biometric data is also sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) so that ICE can determine whether the individual is a priority for removal, consistent with the DHS enforcement priorities described in former Secretary Johnson’s November 20, 2014 Secure Communities memorandum. Under PEP, ICE will seek the transfer of a removable individual when that individual has been convicted of an offense listed under the DHS civil immigration enforcement priorities, has intentionally participated in an organized criminal gang to further the illegal activity of the gang, or poses a danger to national security.
What are DHS’ priorities for removal?
PEP builds upon the enforcement priorities set forth in the November 20, 2014 Memorandum from former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson entitled Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants.
Forms
Under PEP, DHS does not use the Form I-247 (Immigration Detainer – Notice of Action) and instead uses two new forms:
Form I-247N, Request for Voluntary Notification of Release of Suspected Priority Alien: The Form I-247N requests the receiving local law enforcement agency (LEA) notify ICE of the pending release from custody of a suspected priority removable individual at least 48 hours prior to release, if possible. The Form I-247N does not request or authorize the LEA to hold an individual beyond the point at which he or she would otherwise be released. Additionally, on the Form I-247N, ICE must identify the enforcement priority under which the individual falls.
Form I-247D, Immigration Detainer - Request for Voluntary Action: The Form I-247D requests the receiving LEA maintain custody of the priority individual for a period not to exceed 48 hours beyond the time when he or she would have otherwise been released from custody. On this form, ICE must identify the enforcement priority under which the individual falls, as well as the basis for its determination of probable cause. The LEA must also serve a copy of the request on the individual in order for it to take effect.
Form I-247-X, Request for Voluntary Transfer: This form is for enforcement priorities that do not fall under the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP). The Form I-247X requests the receiving LEA maintain custody of the priority individual for a period not to exceed 48 hours beyond the time when he or she would have otherwise been released from custody. The priority subcategories not covered by PEP, but for which ICE may otherwise seek transfer from cooperative jurisdictions are:
1(b) – Aliens apprehended while attempting to illegally enter the country
2(c) – Unlawfully present aliens who have not resided continuously in U.S. since January 1, 2014
2(d) – Aliens determined by an FRO to have significantly abused the visa or visa waiver programs
3 – Aliens issued final removal orders on or after January 1, 2014
Also, ICE may work with cooperating states or localities to arrange for the transfer of a removable individual whose removal has been determined by a senior ICE official to serve an important federal interest.
Public Information
ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is committed to a transparent process and to resolving concerns as promptly as possible. For this reason, concerns or questions regarding ICE practices, policies and/or programs should first be directed to the local field liaison. Stakeholders can reach out to their local field office through the ERO Contact page.
How is PEP different from Secure Communities?
PEP focuses on targeting individuals convicted of significant criminal offenses or who otherwise pose a threat to public safety. Under prior policy, detainers could be issued when an immigration officer had reason to believe the individual was removable and fell within one or more enumerated priorities, which included immigration-related categories and having been convicted of or charged with certain crimes.
Under PEP, ICE will only seek transfer of individuals in state and local custody in specific, limited circumstances. ICE will only issue a detainer where an individual fits within DHS’s narrower enforcement priorities and ICE has probable cause that the individual is removable. In many cases, rather than issue a detainer, ICE will instead request notification (at least 48 hours, if possible) of when an individual is to be released. ICE will use this time to determine whether there is probable cause to conclude that the individual is removable.

Relied on fingerprint based biometric data submitted during bookings by state and local law enforcement agencies to the FBI for criminal background checks. Continues to rely on fingerprint-based biometric data submitted during bookings by state and local law enforcement agencies to the FBI for criminal background checks.
Prior to December 21, 2012, the only policy limitations on detainer issuance were that: (1) a law enforcement agency (LEA) had exercised its independent authority to arrest the individual; and (2) the immigration officer had reason to believe that the individual was subject to ICE detention for removal or removal proceedings. Circumstances under which a detainer could be issued were narrowed by a December 12, 2012 policy memorandum, but still included individuals charged, but not yet convicted, of criminal offenses, in addition to individuals with no criminal history, such as individuals with final orders of removal from an immigration judge. Detainers could also be issued in circumstances in which ICE determined an individual posed a significant risk to national security, border security, or public safety. A November 20, 2014 memorandum from DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson significantly narrows the category of individuals for whom DHS will seek transfer from LEA custody and prioritizes individuals who pose a threat to public safety. Under PEP, ICE will no longer seek transfer of individuals with civil immigration offenses alone, or those charged, but not convicted of criminal offenses. Instead, ICE will seek transfer where a removable individual has been convicted of specifically enumerated crimes, has intentionally participated in criminal gang activity, or poses a danger to national security.
Requested that LEAs detain an individual beyond his or her scheduled release date. In many cases, ICE will simply request notification of when an individual who falls within the PEP priorities is to be released—rather than issue a request for detention beyond that point. Under PEP, detainers may only be issued in limited circumstances, when ICE indicates on the form that the individual is both a PEP enforcement priority and that there is probable cause to believe that the subject is removable (such as a final order of removal).
Detainer form requested that LEA provide a copy to the individual subject to the detainer. Detainer form requires that LEA provide a copy to the individual subject to the detainer in order for the request to be effective.
Request to maintain custody was limited to 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Request to maintain custody is limited to 48 hours. Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are no longer excluded.
Basis for “reason to believe” the subject was removable, and therefore subject to a request for detention, was not disclosed on the detainer form. Detainer form requires that the basis for “probable cause” that an individual is removable be indicated:
final order of removal;
pendency of removal proceedings;
biometric match reflecting no lawful status or otherwise removable; or
statements by the subject to an immigration officer and/or other reliable evidence.
Some ICE detainers were issued with respect to foreign-born individuals who did not have records or a biometric match in ICE databases without any other additional information. ICE no longer issues detainers in cases of foreign-born individuals who do not have records or a biometric match in ICE databases, without any other additional information. Detainers must include an indication of probable cause and that the individual is an enforcement priority under PEP.

          ""We are committed to supporting DHS and CBP in securing our border...""
—Gen. Glen D. VanHerck
        DoD Support to U.S. Border Security
U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is supporting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its operational component, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), by providing mission-enhancing capabilities to secure the border and stop the flow of human trafficking, illegal drugs, contraband, criminals, and illegal immigrants into the country. USNORTHCOM’s mission-enhancing support enables CBP to conduct their law enforcement mission more efficiently and to support DHS efforts to manage border security and immigration processes.
     Securing Borders
Border Operations
Securing Borders
The Department of Defense (DoD) has a long history of supporting efforts to secure U.S. borders. Since the early 1990s, DoD has supported civilian law enforcement agencies’ border security activities including counterdrug, counter transnational organized crime, and other transnational threats. The scope and magnitude of the support provided today is similar to the support provided during the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations.
Military personnel do not directly participate in civilian law enforcement activities. The duties performed by military personnel include detection and monitoring, logistics, and transportation support that enhances CBP’s ability to impede or deny illegal crossings, maintain situational awareness, and apply the appropriate law enforcement response in support of its overall border security mission.
Up to 4,000 service members, primarily sourced from the National Guard, are authorized to support the CBP’s border security mission along the southwest border, including personnel supporting in place from their home stations. The number of forces fluctuates as units rotate in and out of the operation.

Gov. Greg Abbott empowers state authorities to return migrants to border crossings
Immigration law enforcement is a federal responsibility. Abbott appears to be testing the limits of state authority by empowering state law enforcement to bring migrants to the ports of entry — stopping short of using state resources to expel migrants from the country.

Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday cleared state authorities to return migrants they apprehend to the border, setting up a potential clash with the federal government over the authority to enforce immigration law.
Immigration law enforcement is a federal responsibility. Abbott appears to be testing the limits of state authority by empowering state law enforcement and National Guard troops under state deployment to bring migrants to the ports of entry — stopping short of using state resources to expel migrants from the country, as immigration hawks have increasingly called for in recent months.
It was not immediately clear how state law enforcement would determine which migrants should be transported.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Despite the state’s allocation of $4 billion for border security and the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and state police to the border, Abbott has faced growing pressure from within his party to assert a stronger state role and invoke “invasion” powers under the U.S. Constitution. Such a declaration, some Texas Republicans contend, would give states solid legal ground to invoke war powers to allow the state’s National Guard to deport migrants. The idea has been widely derided by legal experts as a political ploy, and Abbott earlier this year expressed concern that it could expose state law enforcement to federal prosecution.
But on Thursday, Abbott stopped just shy of fulfilling those requests.
The executive order allows the Texas National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety to apprehend “immigrants who cross the border between ports of entry or commit other violations of federal law, and to return” them to ports of entry. It is unclear from the executive order what state authorities would do with the migrants once they returned them to the ports of entry, which are manned by federal immigration authorities.
Abbott’s office did not respond to questions seeking clarification.
“While President Biden refuses to do his job and enforce the immigration laws enacted by Congress, the State of Texas is once again stepping up and taking unprecedented action to protect Americans and secure our southern border,” Abbott said in a statement.
Immigration experts said the order raises a number of legal questions.
Under Operation Lone Star, Abbott’s highly touted mission to secure the border, the governor has authorized troopers and National Guard service members to arrest migrants for state crimes, like trespassing. That has allowed the state to arrest thousands of migrants and hold them in the state's criminal justice system.
But if state authorities are authorized to return those migrants to the border after they are arrested, the order raises a question of whether those authorities are attempting to enforce immigration law, said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute.

“In terms of transporting, that’s exactly the question I’d have. Where would be the authority [come from] for state officials to transport people they suspect of being in violation of immigration law and having just recently crossed without arresting them for some reason?” said Meissner, who ran the U.S. Immigration and Nationalization Service from 1993 to 2000. “Were they to do that, I think that raises pretty basic civil rights violation questions.”
Aaron Reichlin-Melnik, policy director for the American Immigration Council, said Abbott's order deputizes state authorities to arrest migrants for federal immigration violations, which the U.S. Supreme Court has said is a federal responsibility. State authorities can only enforce immigration law if they've been permitted by the federal government.
“Gov. Abbott is inviting a lawsuit from the Biden administration just as the Arizona legislature did over a decade ago ... which led to the Supreme Court laying out that the federal government alone has authority to do immigration enforcement,” he said.
Reichlin-Melnik said the order could also expose troopers and National Guard service members to a lawsuit from migrants. He noted that as recently as April, Abbott had expressed concern that issuing an “invasion” declaration could expose state authorities to federal prosecution.

“Any National Guard troops or troopers deputized to do this could theoretically face civil liability from the immigrant if the person decided to sue,” he said. “It is a really risky gambit and one whose most likely victims would be the law enforcement officers he orders to carry out the duty and not him.”
Abbott’s executive order does not explicitly declare an ""invasion"" but makes reference to the part of the U.S. Constitution its proponents have cited. The executive order says Biden’s “failure to faithfully execute the immigration laws enacted by Congress confirms” he has abandoned his constitutional duty to protect the state against an “invasion.”
On Tuesday, a group of county leaders in South Texas called on Abbott to declare an “invasion” and begin putting state resources toward expelling migrants, saying the crossing of migrants through their regions was causing property damage and an increase in crime. The same day, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick echoed such calls.
“If we’re being invaded under the Constitution, I think that gives us the power to put hands on people and send them back,” Patrick said on Fox News.

Abbott’s executive order was not enough to satisfy one of the loudest advocates for him to declare an “invasion,” the Center for Renewing America. Two officials with the think tank, Russ Vought and Ken Cuccinelli, issued a statement noting that Abbott “does not appear to formally declare an invasion not direct [state law enforcement] to remove illegals across the border directly to Mexico.”
“That is critical,” they said. “Otherwise this is still catch and release.”
The call to invoke the U.S. and Texas constitutions to declare an invasion as a means to crack down on immigration is based on a fringe legal theory that gained mainstream attention earlier this year when Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said that state’s governor, Doug Ducey, would be on solid legal ground to invoke war powers to send the state’s National Guard to its border to stop an “invasion” of drug cartels and criminal gangs. Brnovich is running for U.S. Senate as a Republican. Ducey, also a Republican, has resisted calls to declare an invasion.
Immigration rights groups have repeatedly condemned referring to migrants as an “invasion,” noting the rhetoric is dangerous to Latino communities and was cited by the El Paso shooter who killed 23 people in 2019. Law enforcement said the gunman left a message saying the attack was “in response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”

Reichlin-Melnick criticized Abbott’s order as an “election year stunt” to appease immigration hawks in his party.
“Greg Abbott doesn’t technically declare an invasion in this document but he flirts around it,” he said. “This has been something Gov. Abbott has been pressured to do by the far right for months now, trying to invoke a nonexistent authority in the Constitution for states to supposedly protect themselves from an invasion.”
State Sen. César Blanco, D-El Paso, said in a statement the “executive order is not an effective solution.”
“Our borders are not facing an invasion,” the statement said. “We are facing a humanitarian crisis that demands a humanitarian response. This policy is unconstitutional and the rhetoric is dangerous.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas said in a statement the order was “vicious and unlawful” and “recklessly fans the flames of hate in our state.”
“The governor is once again playing politics rather than addressing the real needs of Texans,” the statement from staff attorney Kate Huddleston said. “The Biden administration should act swiftly to condemn this unlawful order and ensure that federal agencies play no role in it.”
Abbott’s executive order comes just a week after Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe announced his office was taking matters into its own hands by transporting migrants to the border. He said his office took four migrants into custody after they had been involved in a car wreck. He tried to turn them over to immigration officials, but they would not take them because they said the migrants needed to be medically cleared.
Coe said he did not have enough deputies to wait with the migrants for hours at the hospital so he made a “command decision” to offer them a ride back to the U.S. port of entry in Eagle Pass.

On Thursday, Brent Smith, a Kinney County attorney, said Abbott’s actions fell short.
“Without declaring an invasion and invoking the self defense clause under Article 1, the lawlessness and violence occurring on our border with Mexico will continue to be allowed by DHS and their unconstitutional immigration policies,” Smith said in a statement.

UVALDE SCHOOL SHOOTING
“Systemic failures” in Uvalde shooting went far beyond local police, Texas House report details
In total, 376 law enforcement officers descended upon the school, according to the most extensive account of the shooting to date. It says that better-equipped departments should have stepped up to fill a leadership void after the Uvalde schools police chief failed to take charge.

The 18-year-old who massacred 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde on May 24 had no experience with firearms before his rampage began. He targeted an elementary school with an active shooter policy that had been deemed adequate but also had a long history of doors propped open.
No one was able to stop the gunman from carrying out the deadliest school shooting in Texas history, in part because of “systemic failures and egregious poor decision making” by nearly everyone involved who was in a position of power, a new investigation into the shooting has found.
On Sunday, a Texas House committee released the most exhaustive account yet of the shooter, his planning, his attack and the fumbling response he provoked.

A year before Uvalde shooting, gunman had threatened women, carried around a dead cat and been nicknamed “school shooter”
JULY 17, 2022
The 77-page report, reviewed by The Texas Tribune, provides a damning portrayal of a family unable to recognize warning signs, a school district that had strayed from strict adherence to its safety plan and a police response that disregarded its own active shooter training.
It explains how the gunman, who investigators believe had never fired a gun before May 24, was able to stockpile military-style rifles, accessories and ammunition without arousing suspicion from authorities, then enter a supposedly secure school unimpeded and indiscriminately kill children and adults.
In total, 376 law enforcement officers — a force larger than the garrison that defended the Alamo — descended upon the school in a chaotic, uncoordinated scene that lasted for more than an hour. The group was devoid of clear leadership, basic communications and sufficient urgency to take down the gunman, the report says.

Notably, the investigation is the first so far to criticize the inaction of state and federal law enforcement, while other reports and public accounts by officials have placed the blame squarely on Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police Chief Pete Arredondo for his role as incident commander and other local police who were among the first to arrive.
The report also reveals for the first time that the overwhelming majority of responders were federal and state law enforcement: 149 were U.S. Border Patrol, and 91 were state police — whose responsibilities include responding to “mass attacks in public places.” There were 25 Uvalde police officers and 16 sheriff’s deputies. Arredondo’s school police force accounted for five of the officers on the scene. The rest of the force was made up of neighboring county law enforcement, U.S. marshals and federal Drug Enforcement Administration officers.

What we know, minute by minute, about how the Uvalde shooting and police response unfolded
UPDATED: JULY 28, 2022
The investigators said that in the absence of a strong incident commander, another officer could have — and should have — stepped up to the task.
“These local officials were not the only ones expected to supply the leadership needed during this tragedy,” the report said. “Hundreds of responders from numerous law enforcement agencies — many of whom were better trained and better equipped than the school district police — quickly arrived on the scene.”
The other responders “could have helped to address the unfolding chaos.”

The three committee members — Rep. Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock; Rep. Joe Moody, D-El Paso; and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman — said they sought to create a comprehensive account the Legislature can use to craft policies aimed at preventing future massacres. The trio also sought to present an accurate narrative to the public, in contrast to several conflicting and retracted accounts provided by other officials, including the governor and state police, in the seven weeks since the tragedy that have undermined residents’ trust in the ongoing investigations.
They dedicated the document to the 21 people killed in the shooting and first unveiled their findings during a private meeting with Uvalde residents on Sunday.
“The Committee issues this interim report now, believing the victims, their families, and the entire Uvalde community have already waited too long for answers and transparency,” the report reads.
Law enforcement failures
The failure of police to quickly subdue the shooter has faced widespread public condemnation and criticism from fellow law enforcement officials. At its core, the committee report echoes criticisms made previously by police tactics experts: that instead of following the doctrine developed after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, which dictates that officers immediately confront active shooters, police at Robb Elementary retreated after coming under fire and then waited for backup.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
“They failed to prioritize saving the lives of innocent victims over their own safety,” the committee said in its report.
The report lists myriad law enforcement mistakes, which expanded far beyond any single commander or agency. They stemmed not from a lack of manpower, but from an absence of leadership and effective communications.
In interviews conducted or obtained by the committee, police officers said they assumed Arredondo was in command or did not know who was in charge. Several described the scene as “chaos” or a “cluster.”
The report listed several ways that an effective incident commander outside the school might have helped: The commander might have noticed that radios weren’t working well and found a better way to communicate. They might have found a master key to the school faster to get inside the classroom where the shooter was barricaded — or suggested checking to make sure the door was locked. Or they might have urged officers to find another way to get inside the classroom.

But Arredondo told The Texas Tribune in June that he did not consider himself the incident commander after he was one of the first officers to arrive inside the school. He said he assumed another officer outside would fill that role.
The committee did not find this argument persuasive. It cited the school district’s active shooter response plan, co-authored by Arredondo, which states the chief will “become the person in control of the efforts of all law enforcement and first responders that arrive at the scene.” The school district last month placed him on administrative leave.

But blame for the flawed police response extends far beyond the school district police chief of a six-officer department, the report concludes.
The report criticized other officers and law enforcement agencies, many of them better trained, for failing to fill the leadership vacuum left by Arredondo’s inaction.
“In this crisis, no responder seized the initiative to establish an incident command post,” the committee wrote. “Despite an obvious atmosphere of chaos, the ranking officers of other responding agencies did not approach the Uvalde CISD chief of police or anyone else perceived to be in command to point out the lack of and need for a command post, or to offer that specific assistance.”

In testimony to a Senate committee June 21, Department of Public Safety Commissioner Steve McCraw said some officers on scene observed that Arredondo was not acting like an incident commander.
McCraw previously dismissed the idea that his state troopers could or should have stepped in to take control from Arredondo.
“Let’s say a DPS captain shows up in a situation, decides he’s going to exercise control,” McCraw told senators last month. “Well, first of all, he doesn’t have the information. And you know what? He may not be as sharp as the on-scene commander that’s there … so I’m reluctant to encourage or even think of any situation where you’d want some level of hierarchy where a larger police department gets to come in and take over.”
Yet when pressed by Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat whose district includes Uvalde, McCraw conceded that confronting an active shooter is more important than deferring to an officer who, according to protocol, is the rightful incident commander.

DPS officials did not respond to requests for comment Sunday.
Ultimately, the report said Border Patrol agents decided they would breach the classroom without seeking permission from Arredondo. That team killed the gunman at 12:51 p.m., ending the standoff.
Despite the collective failure of police to act decisively, the committee uncovered individual instances in which officers acted boldly without instruction.
When officers were driven back by gunfire just after entering the school, Uvalde Police Department Lt. Javier Martinez attempted to confront the shooter again. He advanced up the hallway in “an evident desire to maintain momentum and to ‘stop the killing.’” No officers followed him, and he stopped. Several law enforcement officers told the committee that they believed if others had followed him as backup, he might have made it to the classroom and engaged with the shooter.

DPS Special Agent Luke Williams disregarded a request that he assist in securing a perimeter outside and instead entered the building to help clear rooms. He found a student hiding in a boys bathroom stall with his legs up so he couldn’t be seen. The boy refused to come out until Williams proved he was a police officer, which he did by showing his badge beneath the door of the stall.
Williams then encountered a group of officers clustered at the end of the hallway where the shooter was and overheard someone ask, “Y’all don’t know if there’s kids in there?”
“If there’s kids in there, we need to go in there,” Williams said at 11:56 a.m., according to footage captured by his body camera.
An officer in the hallway responded to Williams that “whoever was in charge would figure that out,” the report said.

Inadequate school safety
Robb Elementary School, on its face, had all the pieces in place to slow an intruder. The school is encircled by a 5-foot fence. It has an emergency management alert system and school policies for faculty and staff to keep exterior and interior doors locked at all times.
But a culture of complacency weakened these safeguards.
Multiple witnesses told the committee that employees often left doors unlocked, while teachers would use rocks, wedges and magnets to prop open interior and exterior doors. This was partly because of a shortage of keys.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
“In fact, the school actually suggested circumventing the locks as a solution for the convenience of substitute teachers and others who lacked their own keys,” the report said.
In March, the teacher in Room 111, through which investigators believe the shooter entered during the massacre, reported to school administrators that his classroom door “was not always locking.” The head custodian testified he never heard of any problems with that door, and maintenance records during the school year do not contain any work orders for it. The teacher, Arnulfo Reyes, was shot twice in the shooting but survived.
Ultimately, the shooter was able to easily scale the fence and enter the school through a series of unlocked doors.
“Had school personnel locked the doors as the school’s policy required, that could have slowed his progress for a few precious minutes — long enough to receive alerts, hide children, and lock doors,” the report found.
The question of locked doors came into play again when law enforcement arrived and assumed they couldn’t break down the doors of the classroom to reach the gunman.
They would fumble for several minutes in search of a key, and other equipment to break down the door, that is now believed to have been unlocked the entire time.
The search for the unnecessary key was complicated by the fact that the school, which first opened in 1955, had different sets of master keys for different doors. Lt. Mike Hernandez of the district police department said he typically carried 50 keys to various campus buildings, though sometimes he had to jiggle them to turn locks. On other occasions, staff changed locks without his knowledge. During the shooting, other officers attempted without success to use Hernandez’s set to find a suitable master key for the wing of the school where the shooter was.
Additionally, some faculty and staff did not initially take the intruder alert seriously because they were desensitized to the alert system, which often was triggered by frequent immigration-related police pursuits.
Uvalde is about 50 miles east of the border with Mexico and sits at the intersection of major highways from the border cities of Del Rio and Eagle Pass. Police described a recent increase in “bailouts,” when officers chase a vehicle containing suspected undocumented migrants, who then purposely crash and scatter to avoid apprehension. School district officials told the committee there had been 47 “secure” or “lockdown” events since February 2022. Around 90% of those had been because of bailouts.
There has never been an incident of school violence related to the bailouts.
“The series of bailout-related alerts led teachers and administrators to respond to all alerts with less urgency—when they heard the sound of an alert, many assumed that it was another bailout,” the report states.
Even when there were alerts, it wasn’t certain that everyone would receive them. The emergency management alert system operates by sending out warnings online to teachers and faculty — and many access it through a smartphone app.
But not all teachers received the alert about the gunman immediately, thanks in part to a poor wireless internet signal that made it difficult to send out the alert and the fact that many teachers didn’t have their phones or had them off at the moment they received it.
Principal Mandy Gutierrez never attempted to communicate the lockdown over the school’s intercom system.
Missed warnings signs
The gunman, Salvador Ramos, displayed signs he was unstable and possibly planning a violent attack, yet none of these warning signs reached authorities.
A year before the massacre, he had earned the nickname “school shooter” on social media platforms because of violent threats he would make against other users. With few, if any, friends and a strained relationship with his parents, the report describes him as a high school dropout and social outcast who eventually concluded that spectacular violence could bring him “notoriety and fame.”
Online, the committee found, he became interested in gore and violent sex, sometimes sharing videos and images of suicides and beheadings. His internet search history suggested he questioned whether he was a sociopath.
In real life, he was fired from two fast-food jobs. At Whataburger, he harassed a female employee and at Wendy’s he would not talk with any co-workers, except one occasion when he attempted to start a conversation about guns.
In the final months of his life, he was determined to acquire guns, a desire the report says family and friends were aware of. Because he lived with his grandmother and had no expenses, he was able to use his money for this effort.
While he was still 17, the shooter asked at least two people to purchase guns for him, but they refused. Instead, he focused on purchasing accessories, including a gun sight, rifle sling and body armor carrier. He turned 18, the legal age to buy guns in Texas, on May 16. Over the course of the next week, he spent more than $3,000 on two AR-15-style rifles from an online retailer, which shipped the weapons to a Uvalde gun shop.
Because he had no license and did not know how to drive, an uncle transported him to the gun store twice. His uncle said the first time he didn’t know he was going to pick up a rifle, since the store is also a popular restaurant in town and his nephew said he was hungry. But he returned with a narrow box and no food.
The owner of the gun store, Oasis Outback, remembered him and described him to investigators as an “average customer with no ‘red flags.’” Other store patrons told the FBI they thought he was “very nervous looking” and “appeared odd and looked like one of those school shooters.”
The report details no attempt by anyone who interacted with the gunman to alert authorities about his troubling behavior.
Undermining trust
In the days after the shooting, state officials unnecessarily undermined public trust in the ongoing investigations by making false statements about what had happened, the report states. The day after the massacre, a Uvalde Police Department lieutenant tasked with briefing Gov. Greg Abbott and other state leaders fainted just before the meeting began.
DPS Regional Director Victor Escalon took his place, relaying the secondhand accounts of police, as he had arrived at the school minutes before the shooting ended. Some of this information was inaccurate, which the committee said was the reason Abbott, in a news conference immediately following the briefing, presented a “false narrative” that the shooting lasted as few as 40 minutes thanks to “officers who rapidly devised a plan, stacked up and neutralized the attacker.”
Abbott also said that the gunman had been confronted by a school resource officer before entering the school. At a news conference the following day, a DPS official said the exterior door through which the gunman entered had been propped open. Both statements were false.
The committee criticized state officials for misleading the public.
“A complete and thorough investigation can take months or even years to confirm every detail, especially when this many law enforcement officers are involved,” the report states. “However, one would expect law enforcement during a briefing would be very careful to state what facts are verifiable, and which ones are not.”
Abbott’s office did not respond to a request for comment Sunday.
The committee also refutes a significant revelation included in a report published last week by the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center at Texas State University. That report stated that a Uvalde Police Department officer with a rifle had an opportunity to shoot the gunman before he entered the school. However, when he asked a supervisor for permission to fire, he never received a response and the gunman slipped into the school.
The committee noted that the ALERRT staff conducted no investigation on their own and relied entirely on information supplied by the Department of Public Safety. The committee concluded that the person the Uvalde officer saw was a coach who was ushering children inside, and found no evidence that any law enforcement personnel had a chance to engage the gunman outside the school.
The disastrous police response at Robb Elementary has set this mass shooting apart from so many that have become a regular occurrence in American life. It has renewed the debate over the role of police and cast doubt on the theory embraced by many Second Amendment advocates that good guys with guns are the best defense against active shooters.
Yet the report concludes with a somber finding: Because the gunman fired the majority of his rounds before police arrived inside the school, about 100 in the space of three minutes, whether the death toll would have been lower had police breached the classrooms immediately is unknown.
Most of the victims died quickly, torn apart by bullets designed for battlefields, and it is unclear whether a flawless police response would have saved any lives. But the report suggests that stopping the gunman sooner could have made a difference.
“Given the information known about victims who survived through the time of the breach and who later died on the way to the hospital,” the committee wrote, “it is plausible that some victims could have survived if they had not had to wait 73 additional minutes for rescue.”

Correction, July 17, 2022 at 6:43 p.m.: The House committee report misstated the name of a federal agency and a previous version of this story repeated the error. It is the Drug Enforcement Administration, not the Drug Enforcement Agency.

Law enforcement cooperation
Law enforcement cooperation
To combat cross-border crimes and terrorism in the EU, it is necessary for law enforcement authorities of different EU countries to cooperate between each other effectively. Previously, authorities cooperated on an ad-hoc basis, bilaterally or multilaterally. Today, the EU facilitates a quicker, safer, and more structured law enforcement cooperation.
The Commission and EU law enforcement agencies, such as the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), cannot investigate autonomously nor lead police operations. This remains the EU countries’ responsibility.
Information exchange
The Commission and EU agencies provide tools for the exchange of information between national law enforcement authorities.
Passenger Data
Passenger data are usually composed of two types of data: Passenger Name Records (PNR) and Advance Passenger Information (API).
Operational cooperation
Learn how law enforcement authorities of different EU countries cooperate to ensure security inside the EU.
Supporting action
The Commission supports security related actions through training, funding, security research and innovation.
Europol
    Europol is at the heart of EU support to Member States in countering serious crime and terrorism. The agency offers support and expertise to national law enforcement authorities in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States, terrorism and forms of crime, which affect a common interest covered by a Union policy.
In particular, Europol is the EU's criminal information hub, providing information sharing capabilities. The backbone is Europol’s Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA), and the Europol Information System (EIS).
Europol also supports operational coordination. The Agency’s Operational Centre is the hub for the exchange of data among Europol, Member States and third countries on specific criminal activities. For example, Europol’s operational analysis supports criminal investigations undertaken by Member States. Europol’s specialised centres provide tailor-made operational support and expertise to counter organised crime, cybercrime and terrorism. For example, the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) provides operational support to Member States in investigations following terrorist attacks.
The Agency’s strategic analysis products aim to give an insight and better understanding of crime and criminal trends, helping decision-makers to identify priorities in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.
On 9 December 2020, the Commission has proposed to strengthen the Europol mandate
to allow the agency to better support national law enforcement authorities with information, analysis and expertise, and to facilitate cross-border police cooperation and terrorism-related investigations. The Commission has also adopted a proposal
to enable Europol to issue alerts in the Schengen Information System (SIS) on the basis of third country sourced information, in particular, to detect foreign terrorist fighters.
Since 1 May 2017, Europol no longer concludes any agreements which allow for the exchange of personal data. However, the agency is permitted to conclude working arrangements which, similar to strategic agreements, govern the practical aspects of exchanging non-personal data and regulate all the practical aspects of the cooperation.
Now, after the entry into force of the Europol Regulation on 1 May 2017, the competence to conclude international agreements for the exchange of personal data between Europol and third countries has been transferred to the Union acting pursuant to Article 218 TFEU.
The first Agreement was signed with New Zealand
on 27th June 2022 and there are ongoing negotiations with other countries [including Turkey and Israel]. The Commission has also received directives for negotiating international agreements with Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia.
Factsheet for the Proposal for a new Europol mandate
Examples of cooperation
The EU Institutions (Commission, Council and Parliament) further facilitate law enforcement cooperation within the EU in different ways.

EU legislation such as the EU passenger name record (PNR) Directive,
databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) or the Visa information system (VIS),
and helping EU countries implement existing legal instruments such as the Prüm decisions or the Swedish decision.
Promote operational cooperation through:
the EU policy cycle for organised and serious international crime/European multidisciplinary platform against criminal threats (EMPACT), through which EU countries, agencies and partners organise around 200 EU joint operational actions against organised and serious international crime per year,
EU legislation organising cross-border cooperation between EU countries such as joint investigations against cross-border crime, joint patrols, cross-border hot pursuits or surveillances,
operational support to EU countries provided by EU agencies such as Europol,
training provided by the EU Agency for law enforcement training (CEPOL) and
supporting national actions through funding, training, and research and innovation.

Granger Remarks at FY23 Homeland Security Subcommittee Markup
Jun 16, 2022 Statements
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
Thank you and Ranking Member Fleischmann for your work on the Homeland Security Bill before us today. 
Unfortunately, I see areas where the funding and policies included in this bill are political and polarizing.
We all know this is a must-pass bill, and these issues will have to be addressed as we move forward, because they are very serious issues that need our consideration.
I will start with the funding. While this bill adds more than $2.7 billion above last year, it does nothing to seriously address the ongoing crisis at our southern border. 
This bill fails to include new funds for the border wall. We know that walls work, and they have shown to effective in stopping illegal immigration.
Instead, this bill lays the groundwork for more illegal immigration.
The policies proposed only enhance the ability of drug cartels to smuggle drugs into our country. 
We would be making it easier for these cartels to take advantage of migrants attempting to make the dangerous journey to the United States.
In fact, the largest migrant caravan so far this year is making its way from Mexico to the southern border as we speak.
Buses carrying the first of some 7,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, arrived at the border earlier this week, and many more will follow.
This bill does nothing but encourage more caravans to come.
By focusing on making migration easier instead of investing in common-sense border security and immigration enforcement, this bill creates real-world consequences for our security.
Some of the most concerning provisions in this bill include:
Using previous border wall funds for environmental issues instead of construction;
Reducing investments in technology to detect and stop those who cross the border illegally;
Decreasing the number of detention beds to house dangerous criminals;
And further restricting the ability to enforce our current laws.
We should prioritize the safety and security of the American people and move a Homeland bill that provides resources to enforce our laws, not undermine them.
If we don’t, border towns, migrants, and communities across the country will all pay a very heavy price. 
As illegal migrants continue to come to the southwest border at record-high levels, I urge my colleagues to reconsider the direction of this bill.
Border crossings in the month of May were the highest in twenty years, and we are on track for another record-breaking year.
We must bring border security back to the Homeland Security bill. 
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I look forward to working together on these very important issues as we move forward. I yield back.

Key facts about Title 42, the pandemic policy that has reshaped immigration enforcement at U.S.-Mexico border
BY JOHN GRAMLICH
The Biden administration is seeking to end the use of Title 42, a pandemic-era policy that has led the Border Patrol to turn away hundreds of thousands of migrants attempting to enter the United States at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past two years. The administration’s move to end the Title 42 policy has been cheered in some corners and criticized in others, and opponents of the decision are challenging it in court and in Congress.
As the debate over the use of Title 42 unfolds, here are answers to key questions about the policy, based primarily on information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the agency that oversees the Border Patrol.
How we did this
What is Title 42?
Title 42 refers to a rarely used section of the U.S. Code that dates to 1944. The law empowers federal health authorities to prohibit migrants from entering the country if it is determined that doing so could prevent the spread of contagious diseases.
The CDC invoked Title 42 at the beginning of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak in March 2020, giving Border Patrol agents the authority to swiftly expel migrants trying to enter the U.S. instead of allowing them to seek asylum within the country, as had long been the policy before the pandemic. Migrants expelled from the U.S. under Title 42 are returned to their home country or most recent transit country.
Part of the rationale for invoking Title 42 was to avoid holding migrants in crowded U.S. immigration facilities as the highly transmissible coronavirus was spreading. But some advocates, elected officials and others have criticized the policy as more of an effort to restrict immigration to the U.S. than a public health strategy.
Why is the Biden administration seeking to end the use of Title 42?
In announcing its decision to end the policy after more than two years, the CDC cited “current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19,” including vaccines that can be distributed to migrants who are arriving at the border.
The Biden administration had initially planned for the policy to end on May 23, but a federal judge and members of Congress are considering putting that plan on hold amid concerns that the decision could lead to a surge in migration in the weeks and months ahead.
The CDC already ended the use of Title 42 for one group of migrants – unaccompanied minors – in March. It is currently seeking to end the policy for two other groups of migrants: single adults and people traveling in families.
What is the alternative to Title 42?
Before the CDC invoked Title 42, the Border Patrol handled migrants under a separate section of the U.S. Code known as Title 8, which deals with border enforcement.
Under Title 8, migrants typically can seek asylum in the U.S., citing a credible fear of persecution or other threats in their home country. The Biden administration has said that it would return to Title 8 enforcement practices after the Title 42 policy ends. (This infographic from the Congressional Research Service shows how immigration enforcement practices work under both Title 8 and Title 42. The Border Patrol has relied on both approaches during the pandemic.)
A return to pre-pandemic enforcement practices does not necessarily mean that migrants would be allowed to enter and remain in the country. Many of them would need to wait in Mexico until their asylum claims can be decided – the result of a Trump administration policy that the Biden administration has kept in place under court order.
Migrants who cannot establish a legal claim to remain in the country would face removal from the U.S. and potentially other penalties. For example, those who are repeatedly caught attempting to enter the U.S. without authorization could be prosecuted criminally, as they frequently have been in the past.
How has immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border changed in the era of Title 42?
The Border Patrol tracks migration patterns at the southwestern border through a metric known as “encounters.” The term refers to two distinct kinds of events: expulsions, in which migrants are immediately removed from the U.S. under Title 42, and apprehensions, in which migrants are detained in the U.S., at least temporarily, under Title 8.
The Border Patrol has retained some discretion over whether to process migrants under Title 42 or Title 8, but most encounters during COVID-19 have ended in expulsion under Title 42.
Overall, there were nearly 2.9 million encounters with migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border between April 2020, the first full month after Title 42 went into effect, and March 2022, the most recent month with available data. Nearly 1.8 million of those encounters, or 61%, resulted in migrants being expelled under Title 42. The roughly 1.1 million remaining encounters ended in migrants being apprehended under Title 8.
It’s important to note that while the number of migrant encounters has risen sharply during the pandemic, the number of individuals encountered is considerably lower. That’s because around a quarter of migrant encounters at U.S. borders during the pandemic have involved repeat crossers. By contrast, in the fiscal year immediately preceding the pandemic, only 7% of migrant encounters involved repeat crossers. Title 42 may have contributed to the increase in repeat border crossers during COVID-19 since those who are expelled from the U.S. under the policy can try to enter the U.S. again without being subject to certain penalties they might otherwise face under Title 8.
Who has been expelled from the country under Title 42?
Almost nine-in-ten of the nearly 1.8 million expulsions that have taken place under Title 42 since April 2020 have involved single adults, while the remainder have involved people traveling in families (11%) or unaccompanied minors (1%).
Mexico is by far the most common origin nation of those who have been expelled under Title 42. Six-in-ten of those who have been expelled under Title 42 have been from Mexico, while 15% have been from Guatemala, 14% have been from Honduras, 5% have been from El Salvador and 6% have been from other countries.
How did the use of Title 42 change from the Trump administration to the Biden administration?
Both administrations leaned heavily on Title 42 in their immigration enforcement practices at the U.S.-Mexico border during the pandemic. But the Trump administration did so more than the Biden administration, at least when looking at the percentage of all encounters that ended in expulsion from the country under Title 42.
Under the Trump administration, 80% or more of monthly migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border resulted in expulsion from the U.S. under Title 42. That percentage declined under Biden, who had pledged during his campaign for the White House to reverse some of Trump’s immigration policies. Even during the Biden administration, however, Title 42 expulsions have remained common: In March 2022, 51% of all migrant encounters at the southwestern border ended in expulsion under Title 42.

PRESS RELEASE
Law Enforcement Cooperation Between United States and Mexico Leads to Mexican Takedown of Significant Human Smugglers
Español
Thursday, March 10, 2022

For Immediate Release
Office of Public Affairs
Extensive bilateral cooperation between the United States and Mexico resulted in the Mexico Attorney General’s Office’s “Fiscalía General de la República” (FGR) conducting a significant enforcement operation to dismantle a prolific transnational human smuggling organization operating in Nogales, Sonora, along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The targeted human smuggling organization is alleged to be responsible for illegally smuggling large numbers of individuals from Mexico, Central America and South America into Arizona and other locations throughout the United States. The enforcement operation included the execution of six arrest warrants in Mexico for smuggling coordinators: Arturo Tienda-Garcia aka Tuercas, Jose Guadalupe Tienda-Garcia aka Pantera, Gilberto Escalante-Osuna aka Mochomo, Uriel Cruz-Tienda aka Quiqui, Cristal Tolentino-Hernandez, and Alfonso Sotelo-Contreras aka Pajaro. 
“The Attorney General established Joint Task Force Alpha to address the threat posed by transnational human smuggling networks, and this operation is a prime example of its impact,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “JTFA marshals the investigative and prosecutorial resources of the department, and its law enforcement partners, to target human smugglers and enhances coordination in transnational law enforcement efforts to better combat these criminal organizations.”
“Border security is less about erecting barriers between nations, and more about increasing cooperation among neighbors,” said U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino for the District of Arizona. “This operation is a stellar example of what can be accomplished when U.S. and Mexican authorities work together across the border. For years, these individuals have violated the laws of the United States and Mexico with impunity, and their apprehension will make citizens of both countries safer.”
“HSI-Phoenix is grateful for its collaboration with HSI Mexico City and their partnership with the Government of Mexico,” said Special Agent in Charge Scott Brown of HSI-Phoenix. “These joint efforts demonstrate the commitment of both of our nations to not let borders be barriers when it comes to confronting the transnational criminal organizations that negatively impact both of our nations.”
U.S. authorities provided assistance to the Mexico Attorney General’s Office through coordination under Joint Task Force Alpha, which was established by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in June 2021 to marshal the investigative and prosecutorial resources of the Department of Justice, in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to enhance U.S. enforcement efforts against the most prolific and dangerous human smuggling and trafficking groups operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. The task force focuses on disrupting and dismantling smuggling and trafficking networks that abuse, exploit and endanger migrants, pose national security threats or are involved in organized crime.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona has also prosecuted other U.S.-based coordinators and operators with ties to the smuggling organization, including Benjamin Gallegos, Amalia Gonzalez-Lara, Sergio Vazquez-Flores, Macario Ulises Barragan-Cisneros, Jaziel Tienda-Ibarra, Daniel Garcia-Salgado, Cesar Bermeo-Diaz, Isamar Chaparro-Vizcarra and Oswaldo Tienda-Castro. These nine individuals have been convicted of conspiracy to transport and harbor illegal aliens for profit. Additional alleged coordinators for the organization have been indicted by a federal grand jury on alien smuggling charges including Enrique Villalobos-Lopez and Ian Esteban Serrano.

HSI-Nogales led the investigation in the United States, working in concert with the U.S. Border Patrol. Support from HSI-Mexico City, with the assistance of HSI’s Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit (TCIU)-Mexico, was critical in providing coordination between American and Mexican law enforcement agencies. The Justice Department, including the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona in Tucson, the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, and the Office of International Affairs, provided significant assistance in this matter.

FACT SHEET: White House Releases 2022 National Drug Control Strategy that Outlines Comprehensive Path Forward to Address Addiction and the Overdose Epidemic
HOME
BRIEFING ROOM
STATEMENTS AND RELEASES
Today, President Biden sent his Administration’s inaugural National Drug Control Strategy to Congress at a time when drug overdoses have taken a heartbreaking toll, claiming 106,854 lives in the most recent 12-month period. The Strategy delivers on the call to action in President Biden’s Unity Agenda through a whole-of-government approach to beat the overdose epidemic.
The Strategy focuses on two critical drivers of the epidemic: untreated addiction and drug trafficking. It instructs federal agencies to prioritize actions that will save lives, get people the care they need, go after drug traffickers’ profits, and make better use of data to guide all these efforts.
Addressing Untreated Addiction for Those At-Risk of an Overdose
According to the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, among the 41.1 million people who needed treatment for substance use disorders (SUD), only 2.7 million (6.5-percent) of them received treatment at a specialty treatment facility over the previous year. One reason for this gap is that people with addiction and those who care for them face too many barriers to treatment. Similarly, key tools like naloxone and syringe services programs are often restricted or underfunded at the community level, which limits access for people who use drugs. For example, some states still have legal barriers that limit access to naloxone, and even in states where those barriers don’t exist, naloxone does not always make it to those most at-risk of an overdose. The President’s National Drug Control Strategy is the first-ever to champion harm reduction to meet people where they are and engage them in care and services. It also calls for actions that will expand access to evidence-based treatments that have been shown to reduce overdose risk and mortality. Finally, it emphasizes the need to develop stronger data collection and analysis systems to better deploy public health interventions.
Expand high-impact harm reduction interventions like naloxone

The Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts focus on meeting people where they are, and building trust and engagement with them to provide care and services. Specifically, the Strategy calls for greater access to harm reduction interventions including naloxone, drug test strips, and syringe services programs. It directs federal agencies to integrate harm reduction into the U.S system of care to save lives and increase access to treatment. It also calls for collaboration on harm reduction between public health and public safety officials, and changes in state laws and policies to support the expansion of harm reduction efforts across the country.
Ensure those at highest-risk of an overdose can access evidence-based treatment

The Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to expand access to treatment are focused around delivering treatment to those at the highest-risk of overdosing, which includes people experiencing homelessness, those who are incarcerated or re-entering society, and people who inject drugs. The Strategy directs federal agencies to take actions that meet people who need treatment where they are, improves the quality of treatment to include payment reform, supports those at-risk of an overdose, and builds up the Nation’s treatment workforce and infrastructure. It also includes a chapter on Criminal Justice that focuses on direct actions that will improve the delivery of evidence-based treatment when appropriate for people in carceral settings or in the reentry process in addition to other justice-impacted persons.
Improve data systems and research that guide drug policy development.

The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to deploying an evidence-based approach to policy-making as directed in the Presidential Memorandum on scientific integrity and evidence-based policymaking. Development of effective drug policy requires timely and rigorous data covering the full range of trends and activities, including consumption patterns, drug use consequences, prevention, harm reduction, treatment, recovery, drug production, transportation and distribution by drug trafficking organizations, and many more. The Strategy directs relevant agencies to strengthen existing data systems, establish new data systems, including for non-fatal overdoses, and enhance the usefulness of drug data for practitioners, researchers and policy-makers.

Going After Drug Trafficking and Illicit Drug Profits
Law enforcement agencies at all levels—federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial—work to reduce domestic and international cultivated and synthetic drug production and trafficking with the goal of protecting Americans. However, drug producers continue to produce entirely new synthetic drugs, and drug traffickers continue to refine their methods and techniques for distributing them throughout our communities.
The Strategy builds on the President’s FY 23 budget request for a $300 million increase to support the work of Customs and Border Protection (CBP)–one of the largest ever increases for CBP–and for a $300 million increase for the Drug Enforcement Administration. The Strategy prioritizes a targeted response to drug traffickers and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) by hitting them where it hurts the most: their wallets. It also includes efforts to strengthen domestic law enforcement cooperation to disrupt the trafficking of illicit drugs within the United States, and increase collaboration with international partners to disrupt the supply chain of illicit substances and the precursor chemicals used to produce them. Lastly, the National Drug Control Strategy includes three companion documents that direct Federal agencies to take actions that stop the trafficking of drugs across our Caribbean, Northern, and Southwest Borders.
Obstruct and disrupt financial activities of transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) that manufacture illicit drugs and traffic them into the United States

The illicit drugs smuggled throughout the world generate enormous revenue, which must be moved and laundered so that traffickers can profit from their illicit enterprise.TCOs also require funds to operate their illicit supply chains and exert their transnational corruptive influence. While bulk cash smuggling remains one of the predominant methods for moving illicit proceeds, smugglers also use trade-based money laundering (TBML) such as Black-Market Peso Exchanges and mirror transfers via informal networks. Additionally, TCOs are adept at using darknet markets and virtual assets to launder funds. The National Drug Control Strategy directs agencies to strengthen and employ every available tool, and seek new ones, to uncover financial networks to obstruct and disrupt the illicit financial activities that fund the TCOs who produce and traffic illicit drugs into the United States.
Reduce the supply of illicit drugs through domestic collaboration and international coordination.

The Strategy directs federal agencies to improve cooperation across all levels of government to strengthen our domestic response to drug trafficking; commercially disrupt the production, trafficking, and distribution of illicit substances; improve assessment of supply reduction initiatives; and protect individuals and the environment at home from criminal exploitation. The Strategy also aims to strengthen foreign partnerships to address drug production and trafficking, leverage the influence of multilateral organizations to tackle shared challenge of synthetic drugs, and protect individuals and the environment abroad from criminal exploitation by those involved in drug trafficking.
Reduce the supply of illicit drugs smuggled across our borders.

The Biden-Harris Administration is focused on stopping drugs from entering our communities. The President’s National Drug Control Strategy includes specific border strategies that direct federal agencies to strengthen interdiction and law enforcement capabilities on our Nation’s borders, counter criminal networks, disrupt illicit finance efforts, target drug transportation routes and modalities, and otherwise aggressively reduce the trafficking of illicit drugs. The Strategy also directs agencies to work with partner governments in drug producing and transit countries to prevent illicit drugs from ever reaching our borders.
In addition, the Strategy directs federal agencies to expand efforts to prevent substance use among school-aged children and young adults, and support community-led coalitions implementing evidence-based prevention strategies across the country. It directs federal agencies to expand scientific understanding of the recovery process by establishing a federal recovery research agenda; adopt flexible, responsive approaches that help people with SUD find and follow a pathway to recovery or remission that works for them; and eliminate barriers and increase economic opportunities for people in recovery. And the Strategy includes specific actions to improve access to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) programs for jails and prisons; identify ways to advance racial equity in the investigation, arrest, and sentencing for drug related offenses without negatively impacting public safety; divert non-violent individuals from the criminal justice system and juvenile justice systems to treatment when appropriate; and remove barriers and expand supportive  services to help reintegrate people into society after incarceration.
The Biden-Harris Administration has already taken significant actions to address addiction and the overdose epidemic based on the President’s Drug Policy Priorities for Year One.

FACT SHEET: Commercial Traffic Delays Along Texas Border and the Resulting Supply Chain Disruptions
Release Date Tue, 04/12/2022
Trucks are facing lengthy delays along the Texas-Mexico border, with wait times at some border crossings exceeding five hours and commercial traffic dropping by as much as 60 percent. The longer than average wait times – and the subsequent supply chain disruptions – are unrelated to CBP screening activities and are due to additional and unnecessary inspections being conducted by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) at the order of the Governor of Texas.
Local trade associations, officials, and businesses are requesting the Texas state government discontinue their additional border truck inspection process because it is not necessary to protect the safety and security of Texas communities and is resulting in significant impacts to local supply chains that will impact consumers and businesses nationally.
These unnecessary inspections are occurring when vehicles exit U.S. ports of entry within the El Paso and Laredo areas of operation after being comprehensively inspected and cleared to enter the United States by CBP. As a result, vehicles have been significantly delayed in exiting the federal inspection plaza, leading to traffic disruptions and critical impacts to an already-strained supply chain.
Every day, at ports of entry, the employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Office of Field Operations (OFO) are at work for the American people ensuring the efficient flow of lawful trade and travel that is so vital to a strong economy, while enforcing hundreds of different laws for multiple federal, state, and local agencies. The ports of entry along our Southwest border allow for the continuous flow of legitimate trade and travel, which is critical to our nation’s economic stability and vibrancy, but they also are the frontline of defense against threats posed by transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). Our efforts ensure shipments of perishable goods, like fruits, vegetables and meat products destined to grocery stores, medical supplies and medicines reach doctor’s offices and hospitals and manufacturing supplies reach plants to keep them open. The movement of these goods are vital not only to communities along the border but across the United States as these goods are used across every business sector and industry in the U.S. The strength of the American economy relies heavily on the efficient flow of cross-border commerce.
  Our Work to Manage Supply Chain Disruptions Resulting from Texas DPS Inspections
In fiscal year 2021 the Laredo Field Office processed more than 3.9M commercial trucks at eight ports of entry with an estimated import value over $212B. The El Paso Field Office processed more than 1M commercial trucks at five ports of entry, with an estimated import value of over $69B. These two field offices located with operations predominantly in the state of Texas, account for more than $280B in cross-border commerce annually.
Laredo Field Office Wait Times:
The Laredo Field Office has seen a significant increase in commercial wait times at ports of entry since April 8, 2022, when inspections by Texas DPS began. Hildalgo/Pharr which averages a 63 minute wait time, reached a peak wait of 320 minutes and experienced a 35% drop in commercial traffic. Currently, protests being conducted in Mexico blocking access to the bridge, purportedly over these Texas DPS inspections, have reduced commercial traffic by 100%.
Colombia Solidarity Bridge, which averages a 26 minute wait time, reached a peak wait of 300 minutes and has seen over a 60% drop in commercial traffic.
Field Office Leadership has remained in contact with the trade communities and expanded operations to surrounding ports of entry to assist with the diverted movement of trade based on business resumption contingency plans.
Surrounding ports of Progreso, Rio Grande, and Roma extended their hours of operations to assist the Port of Hidalgo/Pharr and notified trade stakeholders.
Port of Laredo extended their hours of operations at World Trade Bridge to clear and process diverted traffic from Colombia Solidarity Bridge.
In all instances, port personnel have stayed and worked after hours to clear and process all commercial truck shipments on international bridges because of the increased DPS safety inspections.
El Paso Field Office Wait Times:
The El Paso Field Office has seen a significant increase in commercial wait times at its ports of entry since April 8, 2022, when inspections by Texas DPS began. Ysleta, which averages a 52 minute wait time, reached a peak wait of 335 minutes and has seen over a 50% drop in commercial traffic. Bridge of Americas, which averages a 42 minute wait time, reached a peak wait of 300 minutes and has seen over a 30% drop in commercial traffic.
The El Paso Field Office notified stakeholders of extended hours at the Santa Teresa port of entry to assist with congestion at El Paso ports and remains in contact with the trade community to address concerns.
Our Ongoing Enforcement Efforts:
CBP employs an in-depth strategy at the border to detect and disrupt illegal activity, including narcotics and human smuggling. Pre-primary specialty teams and primary inspections by a CBP officer are examples of interventions available to CBP. The efforts of these teams are driven by experience and observational skills but also by a robust network of personnel who use advance information to identify individuals and transactions for additional scrutiny. Agriculture specialists along the Southern Border remain steadfast ensuring exotic plant pests and foreign animal diseases are not brought into the country. This includes mitigating the severe threat of African swine fever (ASF) that CBPAS are postured to safeguard against employing a layered enforcement posture of agriculture.
CBP utilizes the Automated Targeting System (ATS) as a decision support tool that compares traveler, cargo, and conveyance information against law enforcement, intelligence, and other enforcement data using risk-based assessments. ATS compares existing information on individuals and cargo entering and exiting the country with patterns identified as requiring additional scrutiny. The patterns—or risk assessments—are based on CBP officer experience, analysis of trends of suspicious activity, and raw intelligence corroborating those trends.
CBP also participates in whole of government efforts to stem transnational organized crime. For example, Operation Sentinel is a collaborative effort with CBP, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the U.S. Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration of the U.S. Department of Justice that focuses on transnational criminal organizations associated with migrant smuggling.
Additionally, CBP utilizes Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) equipment to aid in the detection of illicit narcotics and smuggled migrants. The NII Program supports the detection and prevention of contraband, including conventional weapons, weapons of mass effect or destruction, drugs, currency, and other illegal merchandise, from entering or furthering their entry into the United States, while supporting a minimal impact on the flow of legitimate commerce. This program is an essential aspect of the OFO layered enforcement strategy.
In fiscal year 2021 CBP seized more than 900,000 pounds of narcotics. OFO seized over 730,000 pounds of drugs at ports of entry, and in fiscal year 2022 through the end of February has already seized over 250,000 pounds of drugs.
Nationwide, CBP seizures of fentanyl have increased sharply since 2019. In FY2021, CBP seized more than 11,000 pounds of fentanyl, more than twice the weight seized in FY2020 and about four times as much as FY2019.
On April 8th, officers at the Laredo port of entry seized 427 pounds of cocaine worth more than $3M
On April 8th, officers at the El Paso port of entry seized 47 pounds of cocaine work more than $500K
On April 6th, officers at the Pharr International Bridge Caro Facility stopped over $13M work of mixed narcotics from entering the U.S.
On April 6th, officers at the Del Rio port of entry seized over $600K work of mixed narcotics

Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act
Printer-friendly version
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (Public Law No. 117-78), also known as the UFLPA, directs the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force to develop a strategy for supporting enforcement of the prohibition on the importation of goods into the United States manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor in the People's Republic of China, especially from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, or Xinjiang.
The UFLPA was enacted on December 23, 2021, with a June 21, 2022 effective date for a rebuttable presumption that goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in Xinjiang or by an entity on the UFLPA Entity List are prohibited from U.S. importation under 19 U.S.C. § 1307. CBP leads the implementation of the rebuttable presumption under the UFLPA, and more about implementation efforts can be found on the CBP UFLPA page. The FLETF strategy includes the UFLPA Entity List, Importer Guidance, and other information.
CBP Roles and Responsibilities
CBP is responsible for preventing the entry of products made with forced labor into the U.S. market by investigating and acting upon allegations of forced labor in supply chains.
CBP implements Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) through issuance of Withhold Release Orders (WRO) and findings to prevent merchandise produced in whole or in part in a foreign country using forced labor from being imported into the United States.

Dear [Importer],
As you are likely aware, Congress recently passed, and the President signed into law, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“the Act”). The Act, codified under 22 U.S.C. §6901 note, established a rebuttable presumption that any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of the People’s Republic of China or produced by an entity on a list required by clause (i), (ii), (iv) or (v) of section 2(d)(2)(B) are prohibited under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1307) are not entitled to entry at any of the ports of the United States.
The Act requires CBP to apply the rebuttable presumption unless the importer can overcome the presumption of forced labor by establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the good, ware, article, or merchandise was not mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced labor. This elevated standard will require the importer to not only use due diligence in evaluation of its supply chain, but also to respond completely and substantively to CBP requests for information regarding entries it may review.
As your company has previously imported merchandise sourced from locations or entities potentially subject to the Act, you are being notified that any future entries of such merchandise may be subject to CBP enforcement action, including seizure, forfeiture and/or penalties, or other appropriate action under the customs laws. In any future CBP enforcement action related to such merchandise, CBP will take into consideration the fact that you have been provided this notice in determining appropriate administrative remedies.
In anticipation of the rebuttable presumption becoming effective on June 21, 2022, an implementation strategy and guidance for the trade community will be issued to ensure compliance with the Act. CBP is urging importers to be proactive and closely review their supply chains to ensure any goods or materials are not sourced from the XUAR in violation of the Act. It is incumbent upon you as an importer to apply due diligence, effective supply chain tracing, and supply chain management measures to ensure that such imports are free from any goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor from the People’s Republic of China, especially from the XUAR.
For the most up-to-date information on CBP’s UFLPA implementation, please see our website at https://www.cbp.gov/trade/forced-labor/UFLPA. Questions regarding UFLPA may be submitted to UFLPAInquiry@cbp.dhs.gov.

Immigration Action
(En español)
The President asked Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder to undertake a rigorous and inclusive review to inform recommendations on reforming our broken immigration system through executive action. This review sought the advice and input from the men and women charged with implementing the policies, as well as the ideas of a broad range of stakeholders and Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. Our assessment identified the following ten areas where we, within the confines of the law, could take action to increase border security, focus enforcement resources, and ensure accountability in our immigration system.
If you have questions about the new DHS enforcement priorities, the expanded deferred action programs or believe you are eligible for one of the new initiatives, please click here for assistance and additional information.
One Year Later
One year ago, Secretary Jeh Johnson took steps to fix our broken immigration system and policies, learn more about what DHS is doing here.
Executive Actions
Strengthen Border Security
DHS will implement a Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Strategy to fundamentally alter the way in which we marshal resources to the border.  This new plan will employ DHS assets in a strategic and coordinated way to provide effective enforcement of our laws and interdict individuals seeking to illegally enter the United States across land, sea, and air.  To accomplish this, DHS is commissioning three task forces of various law enforcement agencies.  The first will focus on the southern maritime border.  The second will be responsible for the southern land border and the West Coast.  The third will focus on investigations to support the other two task forces.  In addition, DHS will continue the surge of resources that effectively reduced the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally this summer. This included additional Border Patrol agents, ICE personnel, criminal investigators, additional monitors, and working with DOJ to reorder dockets in immigration courts, along with reforms in these courts.
Executive Action: Strengthen Border Security
Revise Removal Priorities
DHS will implement a new department-wide enforcement and removal policy that places top priority on national security threats, convicted felons, gang members, and illegal entrants apprehended at the border; the second-tier priority on those convicted of significant or multiple misdemeanors and those who are not apprehended at the border, but who entered or reentered this country unlawfully after January 1, 2014; and the third priority on those who are non-criminals but who have failed to abide by a final order of removal issued on or after January 1, 2014.  Under this revised policy, those who entered illegally prior to January 1, 2014, who never disobeyed a prior order of removal, and were never convicted of a serious offense, will not be priorities for removal.  This policy also provides clear guidance on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.
Executive Action: Revise Removal Priorities
End Secure Communities and Replace it with New Priority Enforcement Program
DHS will end the Secure Communities program, and replace it with the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) that will closely and clearly reflect DHS’s new top enforcement priorities. The program will continue to rely on fingerprint-based biometric data submitted during bookings by state and local law enforcement agencies and will identify to law enforcement agencies the specific criteria for which we will seek an individual in their custody. The list of largely criminal offenses is taken from Priorities 1 and 2 of our new enforcement priorities. In addition, we will formulate plans to engage state and local governments on enforcement priorities and will enhance Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) ability to arrest, detain, and remove individuals deemed threats to national security, border security, or public safety.
Executive Action: End Secure Communities and Replace it with New Priority Enforcement Program
Personnel Reform for ICE Officers
Related to these enforcement and removal reforms, we will support job series realignment and premium ability pay coverage for ICE ERO officers engaged in removal operations.  These measures are essential to bringing ICE agents and officers pay in line with other law enforcement personnel.
Executive Action: Personnel Reform for ICE Officers
Expand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program
We will expand eligibility for DACA to encompass a broader class of children.  DACA eligibility was limited to those who were under 31 years of age on June 15, 2012, who entered the U.S. before June 15, 2007, and who were under 16 years old when they entered.  DACA eligibility will be expanded to cover all undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. before the age of 16, and not just those born after June 15, 1981.  We will also adjust the entry date from June 15, 2007 to January 1, 2010.  The relief (including work authorization) will now last for three years rather than two.
Executive Action: Expand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program
Extend Deferred Action to Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA)
DHS will extend eligibility for deferred action to individuals who (i) are not removal priorities under our new policy, (ii) have been in this country at least 5 years, (iii) have children who on the date of this announcement are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, and (iv) present no other factors that would make a grant of deferred action inappropriate.  These individuals will be assessed for eligibility for deferred action on a case-by-case basis, and then be permitted to apply for work authorization, provided they pay a fee.  Each individual will undergo a thorough background check of all relevant national security and criminal databases, including DHS and FBI databases. With work-authorization, these individuals will pay taxes and contribute to the economy.
Executive Action: Extend Deferred Action to Parents of U.S. Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents
Expand Provisional Waivers to Spouses and Children of Lawful Permanent Residents
The provisional waiver program DHS announced in January 2013 for undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens will be expanded to include the spouses and children of lawful permanent residents, as well as the adult children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.  At the same time, we will further clarify the “extreme hardship” standard that must be met to obtain the waiver.
Executive Action: Expand Provisional Waivers to Spouses and Children of Lawful Permanent Residents
Revise Parole Rules
DHS will begin rulemaking to identify the conditions under which talented entrepreneurs should be paroled into the United States, on the ground that their entry would yield a significant public economic benefit.  DHS will also support the military and its recruitment efforts by working with the Department of Defense to address the availability of parole-in-place and deferred action to spouses, parents, and children of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who seek to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. DHS will also issue guidance to clarify that when anyone is given “advance parole” to leave the country – including those who obtain deferred action - they will not be considered to have departed.  Undocumented aliens generally trigger a 3- or 10-year bar to returning to the United States when they depart.
Executive Action: Revise Parole Rules - Entrepreneurs
Executive Action: Revise Parole Rules - Parole-in-Place and Deferred Action
Executive Action: Revise Parole Rules - Advance Parole
Promote the Naturalization Process
To promote access to U.S. citizenship, we will permit the use of credit cards as a payment option for the naturalization fee, and expand citizenship public awareness. It is important to note that the naturalization fee is $680, currently payable only by cash, check or money order. DHS will also explore the feasibility of expanding fee waiver options.
Executive Action: Promote the Naturalization Process
Support High-skilled Business and Workers
DHS will take a number of administrative actions to better enable U.S. businesses to hire and retain highly skilled foreign-born workers and strengthen and expand opportunities for students to gain on-the-job training.  For example, because our immigration system suffers from extremely long waits for green cards, we will amend current regulations and make other administrative changes to provide needed flexibility to workers with approved employment-based green card petitions.

Border Security
Human Trafficking
In 2000, Congress signed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act into law, representing the beginning of a large-scale, coordinated effort by the United States government to fight human trafficking.
Twenty years later, human trafficking still remains prevalent. According to recent figures available (Source: Global Estimates of Modern Slavery: Forced Labour and Forced Marriage , Geneva, September 2017):
At any given time in 2016, an estimated 40.3 million people are in modern slavery, including 24.9 million in forced labor and 15.4 million in forced marriage.
It means there are 5.4 victims of modern slavery for every 1,000 people in the world.
1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are children.
Out of the 24.9 million people trapped in forced labor, 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture; 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons in forced labor imposed by state authorities.
Women and girls are disproportionately affected by forced labor, accounting for 99% of victims in the commercial sex industry, and 58% in other sectors
What Is Human Trafficking?
Although the legal definition of human trafficking is complex, the simple meaning of it is not. It occurs when a person is induced by force, fraud or coercion to:
Work under the total or near-total control of another person or organization (slavery or involuntary servitude)
Forced to pay off a loan by working instead of paying money, for an agreed-upon or unclear period of time (debt bondage) or even without an agreement as to the timeframe (peonage)
Perform a sex act for money or anything of value (if under 18, force, fraud or coercion is not required)
According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, although many people think of the sex trade when they think of human trafficking, this crime also occurs in such labor situations as:
Domestic servitude
Labor in a prison-like factory
Migrant agricultural work.
In addition, with respect to labor situations, the initial agreement to travel or to perform work does not mean that the employer is later allowed to restrict a victim's freedom or use force or threats to obtain repayment.
Human trafficking and human smuggling are sometimes, but not always, linked, because not all individuals who are smuggled are trafficked, and movement is not required for trafficking to occur.
""Force, Fraud or Coercion""
These terms include any situation where an individual is forced to do something against their will, or where they are tricked into doing something by someone who is lying to them or suppressing the truth. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, force can be active and physical or indirect and psychological (including threats). This term includes:
Coercion
Compulsion
Constraint
Restraint
Coercion refers to behaviors including:
Threats of harm or physical restraint
Trying to get a person to believe that if they don't do something, it will result in serious harm or physical restraint of themselves or someone else
The abuse (or threatened abuse) of law or the legal process
Fraud refers to intentionally distorting the truth in order to get someone else (who relies on that version of the truth) to surrender a legal right or give up something valuable that belongs to them.
A Complex Crime
Human trafficking entangles victims in a nearly impenetrable web, for a number of reasons:
The victim may not realize that he or she is imprisoned, because coercion is psychological (it may not be physical)
Victims are typically impoverished and financially dependent on their captors
Often the crime takes place in plain view-e.g. in a restaurant, worksite, or private home-and is not immediately apparent to observers
Victims can be exploited for labor, sex, or both, particularly in private homes.
Signs of Human Trafficking
It is sometimes said that human trafficking is an ""invisible crime,"" because its signs are not always obvious to the untrained eye. However, there are some indicators that may serve as a tip-off, particularly when they appear in combination. Suspect that something is amiss if an individual:
Lacks control of identification documents or travel documents
Lives and works in the same place
Lacks freedom of movement
Seems to be restricted from socializing, attending religious services or contacting family
Seems to have been deprived of basic life necessities, such as food, water, sleep or medical care
Shows signs of having been abused or physically assaulted. Such signs range from the more obvious, such as broken bones, to the more subtle, such as branding or tattooing
Seems submissive or fearful in the presence of others
Seems not to control his or her schedule
Seems to lack concrete short- or long-term plans
Seems to lack knowledge about the place where he or she lives
Appears to date much older, abusive or controlling men.
A Government Partnership
Four executive agencies of the U.S. government, along with state and local law enforcement organizations, work together as well as with nonprofit organizations to combat human trafficking. The primary U.S. executive agencies include:
Department of Homeland Security , of which U.S. Customs and Border Protection , U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services are component agencies
State Department
Department of Justice
Department of Health and Human Services

DHS Activities Combating Human Trafficking
The Department of Homeland Security and its component agencies have been raising awareness for the past several years about the issue of human trafficking. Most recently, DHS announced an aggressive effort to protect victims and prosecute traffickers, in line with the TVPA's focus on three key goals:
Prevention
Protection
Prosecution
Currently, the Department is focusing on the first of the three goals above, by sponsoring heavily advertised public awareness campaigns about human trafficking created by CBP and its sister agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and making potential victims aware that they are in danger, and that the government offers resources to provide them with asylum and other forms of assistance.
Actions CBP Is Taking To Enforce TVPA
With more than 42,000 frontline CBP officers and Border Patrol agents protecting nearly 7,000 miles of land border and 328 ports of entry—including official crossings by land, air, and sea—CBP is uniquely situated to deter and disrupt human trafficking. Currently, the agency is:
Identifying potential victims as they seek to enter the U.S.
Directing potential victims to U.S. agencies providing legal protection and assistance, through printed materials with educational information and telephone numbers where help can be obtained
Raising awareness among the American public of this often-invisible, yet pervasive crime, through public service announcements
Raising awareness internationally among potential border-crossers before they fall into the hands of traffickers, in countries where this crime is pervasive and where border smuggling frequently involves human trafficking
Helping the public to report suspected cases of human trafficking
Identifying imports produced by forced labor and stopping them from entering the country
Dedicating an office specifically to combating human trafficking
Partnering with other law enforcement agencies to identify and support victims, such as by educating legal counsel to detect signs of victimization, to disrupt the crime itself and to prosecute human traffickers
Partnering with non-governmental organizations to provide information about government assistance to potential victims
Participating in the development of best practices for law enforcement efforts within the U.S. and internationally.
Training is Key
Within the agency, CBP has implemented comprehensive training for its frontline personnel with more forthcoming. Through its local field and sector offices, CBP is instructing them to recognize potential instances of human trafficking and to take appropriate actions when encountering human trafficking victims.
Conclusion
Human trafficking is a heinous international crime, and as the State Department notes in its most recent report on the subject, it is unfortunately flourishing due to current global financial issues. With global demand for labor decreasing, impoverished workers find themselves taking greater risks than before in order to survive. The result: ""a recipe for greater forced labor of migrant workers and commercial sexual exploitation of women in prostitution.""

DHS Begins Implementation of Immigration Enforcement Priorities
Release Date: November 29, 2021
WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security today announced it will begin implementation of the Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas on September 30.  
“Today is an important step forward in ensuring that our workforce is empowered to exercise its prosecutorial discretion and focus its enforcement efforts on those who pose a threat to our national security, public safety, and border security,” said Secretary Mayorkas.  “DHS will carry out our mission to safeguard our country justly and humanely.  In making our enforcement decisions, we will focus our efforts on the greatest threats while also recognizing that the majority of undocumented noncitizens, who have been here for many years and who have contributed positively to our country’s well-being, are not priorities for removal.”  
With the new guidelines, officers will, to the fullest extent possible, obtain and review the entire criminal record, administrative record, and any other investigative information available, to include both aggravating and mitigating factors, in making their enforcement decisions.  This will ensure a thorough and case-by-case assessment of whether enforcement action is warranted and appropriate, thus allowing DHS to focus its limited resources on cases of greatest importance to the national interest. 

Officers are receiving continuous training on the guidelines and participating in small group sessions to ensure consistent application of the guidelines nationwide.  Officers also are receiving ongoing web-based and in-person training to ensure effective implementation.  
As described in the September 30th memo announcing the new guidelines, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will ensure there is a fair and equitable case review process that affords noncitizens and their representatives an opportunity to obtain expeditious review of an enforcement action taken.  ICE will be issuing a memo in short order describing this process. 

Secretary Mayorkas will continue to hold engagements with the DHS workforce and leadership across the country, as well as with a range of stakeholders including law enforcement, civic, and community leaders as the new guidance is implemented.

Transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) pose an ever-present threat to border security, public safety and national security. Their members are involved in countless criminal activity, including murder, narcotics and weapons trafficking and human smuggling. To combat this, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) uses its unique immigration and customs legal authorities to protect the United States from all illegal activity with a border nexus. As the largest investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), combating TCOs illegally exploiting America’s travel, trade, financial and immigration systems is the primary focus of HSI special agents.
As part of those efforts, HSI’s Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) gathers officers from more than 100 different law enforcement agencies under one roof to combat emerging and existing TCOs by employing the full range of federal, state, local, tribal and international law enforcement authorities and resources in the fight to identify, investigate, disrupt and dismantle these organizations at every level of operation. The BESTs strategy eliminates the barriers between federal and local investigations and close the gap with international partners in multinational criminal investigations. Over the years, BEST has become a successful interagency law enforcement collaboration model that’s keeping the homeland safer.
BEST History
In 2005, HSI partnered with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other law enforcement partners to create a BEST in Laredo, Texas. The success of this task force led to it being recognized as a model program for leveraging efforts against TCOs and enhancing border security. As DHS’s “executive agent” for the development and management of the BEST program, HSI has led a collaborative campaign to establish and administer these investigative task forces in locations most affected by transnational crime.
In 2006, ICE was designated to serve as the executive agent for DHS in the development and management of BESTs. BESTs were initially established in locations where the threat of cross-border crime and associated violence exist.
In executing its operations BEST special agents and task force officers investigate a wide range of criminal activity to include drug trafficking, arms trafficking, human trafficking and smuggling, gangs, money laundering and bulk cash smuggling, child exploitation, maritime smuggling, illicit tunnels, and commercial fraud. BESTs also work in conjunction with other investigative, analytic, and information sharing entities and programs including High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA), Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), state and metropolitan area fusion centers, and Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF).
  Border Enforcement Security Task Forces in the U.S.
BESTs are comprised of more than 1,200 members and are located along northern and southwest land borders, major sea and river ports and international airports from Hawaii to Puerto Rico. In FY18, HSI expanded the BEST program from 88 to 96 groups under 69 sanctioned units throughout the United States at air sea, and land ports. The local HSI special agent in charge determines the mission for the BEST within their area of responsibility. Several BESTs serve more specialized missions targeting illicit cross-border tunnels, maritime smuggling (contraband and human) using modified fishing vessels (panga) and illegal international flights using ultralight aircraft for smuggling contraband.
The Opioid Fight
BESTs are a significant tool used to combat opioid smuggling. Additionally, HSI established BEST units within international mail facilities specifically targeting opioids. HSI is working with international carriers identifying and intercepting opioid laden parcels entering the United States. These efforts are aimed at dismantling domestic smugglers and distributors by cutting off their supply chains.
Jaime Zapata BEST Act
In 2012, President Barack Obama signed into law the Jaime Zapata Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) Act (Pub. L. 112-205). The law established the BEST program to enhance border security by fostering coordinated efforts among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to protect U.S. citizens and communities from transnational crime. The law was named in memory of Jaime Zapata, an ICE HSI Special Agent assigned to BEST. On Feb. 15, 2011, Special Agent Zapata was murdered while on duty in Mexico. This law amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to formally establish the BEST program within DHS and authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to direct the assignment of federal personnel to BEST, subject to the approval of the head of the department or agency that employs such personnel, as well as take other actions to aid federal, state, local, tribal, and international law enforcement agencies participating in BEST, including providing financial assistance, as appropriate, for operational, administrative and technical costs associated with their participation in BEST.

Transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) pose an ever-present threat to border security, public safety and national security. Their members are involved in countless criminal activity, including murder, narcotics and weapons trafficking and human smuggling.

Border Patrol Overview
Mission
The priority mission of the Border Patrol is preventing terrorists and terrorists weapons, including weapons of mass destruction, from entering the United States. Undaunted by scorching desert heat or freezing northern winters, they work tirelessly as vigilant protectors of our Nation's borders.
While the Border Patrol has changed dramatically since its inception in 1924, its primary mission remains unchanged: to detect and prevent
the illegal entry of individuals into the United States. Together with other law enforcement officers, the Border Patrol helps maintain borders that work - facilitating the flow of legal immigration and goods while preventing the illegal trafficking of people and contraband.
The Border Patrol is specifically responsible for patrolling nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico. Agents work around the clock on assignments, in all types of terrain and weather conditions. Agents also work in many isolated communities throughout the United States.
Border Patrol Staffing
Since 1924, the Border Patrol has grown from a handful of mounted agents patrolling desolate areas along U.S. borders to today's dynamic work force of over 21,000 agents at the end of FY 2012.
To ensure that the increased staffing and new resources provided by Congress were deployed in the most effective and efficient manner possible, the Immigration and Naturalization Service acted in early 1994 to develop and implement the agency's first National Border Patrol Strategy.
The Border Patrol continues to operate an aggressive recruiting program to bring new Border Patrol agents into the government. Read more about Careers with the Border Patrol.
All Border Patrol agents spend 13 weeks in training at the Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico, which is a component of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
Border Patrol Operations
The primary mission of the Border Patrol is to protect our Nation by reducing the likelihood that dangerous people and capabilities enter the United States between the ports of entry. This is accomplished by maintaining surveillance, following up leads, responding to electronic sensor alarms and aircraft sightings, and interpreting and following tracks. Some of the major activities include maintaining traffic checkpoints along highways leading from border areas, conducting city patrol and transportation check, and anti-smuggling investigations.
Often, the border is a barely discernible line in uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains. The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods to accomplish its mission in such diverse terrain. Electronic sensors are placed at strategic locations along the border to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol even employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles.
Linewatch and Signcutting
Linewatch operations are conducted near international boundaries and coast lines in areas of Border Patrol jurisdiction t
o prevent the illegal entry and smuggling of individuals into the United States and to intercept those who do enter illegally before they can escape from border areas. Signcutting is the detection and the interpretation of any disturbances in natural terrain conditions that indicate the presence or passage of people, animals, or vehicles.
Traffic Checkpoints
Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to (1) detect and apprehend individuals attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border and (2) to detect illegal narcotics.
Transportation Checks

These are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft. Click to read the U.S. Border Patrol transportation check brochure.
Marine Patrol
Along the coastal waterways of the United States and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada, the Border Patrol conducts border control activities from the decks of marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains
over 109 vessels, ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to Headquarters special operations components.
Horse and Bike Patrol
Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support linewatch.
Border Patrol Apprehensions
In FY 2012, Border Patrol agents made over 364,000 arrests of people illegally entering the country. Considerable success has been achieved in restoring integrity and safety to the Southwest border, by implementing our border-control strategy. These include Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego, CA, Operation Hold the Line in El Paso, TX, Operation Rio Grande in McAllen, TX, Operation Safeguard in Tucson, AZ, and the Arizona Border Control Initiative (ABCI) along the Arizona border.
Drug Seizures
An increase in smuggling activities has pushed the Border Patrol to the front line of the U.S. war on drugs. Our role as the primary drug-interdicting organization along the Southwest border continues to expand.
The heightened presence of Border Patrol agents along the Southwest border has burdened narcotic traffickers and human smugglers.
In FY 2012, Border Patrol agents on the Southwest border seized more than 5,900 pounds of cocaine and more than 2.2 million pounds of marijuana.

Secretary Mayorkas Announces New Immigration Enforcement Priorities
Release Date: September 30, 2021
Guidelines focus on national security, public safety, and border security; emphasize prosecutorial discretion 
WASHINGTON – Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas announced new Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law to better focus the Department’s resources on the apprehension and removal of noncitizens who are a threat to our national security, public safety, and border security and advance the interests of justice by ensuring a case-by-case assessment of whether an individual poses a threat.  In the last six months, Secretary Mayorkas held multiple engagements with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) workforce and leadership across the country, as well as with a range of stakeholders including law enforcement, civic, and community leaders to inform the new guidance.   
“For the first time, our guidelines will, in the pursuit of public safety, require an assessment of the individual and take into account the totality of the facts and circumstances,” said Secretary Mayorkas.  “In exercising this discretion, we are guided by the  knowledge that there are individuals in our country who have been here for generations and contributed to our country’s well-being, including those who have been on the frontline in the battle against COVID, lead congregations of faith, and teach our children. As we strive to provide them with a path to status, we will not work in conflict by spending resources seeking to remove those who do not pose a threat and, in fact, make our Nation stronger.”  
Enforcement priorities for apprehension and removal remain focused on noncitizens who are a threat to our national security, public safety, and border security.  But the guidelines are a break from a categorical approach to enforcement.  They require an assessment of the individual and the totality of the facts and circumstances to ensure resources are focused most effectively on those who pose a threat.   
There is also recognition that the majority of the more than 11 million undocumented or otherwise removable noncitizens in the United States have been contributing members of our communities across the country for years.  The fact an individual is a removable noncitizen will not alone be the basis of an enforcement action against them.   The Department’s personnel are to use their discretion and focus the Department’s enforcement resources in a more targeted way. 
“I am grateful to the ICE personnel for their candor and openness in our discussions about their critical law enforcement mission,” continued Mayorkas.  “The new guidelines will enable our Department to most effectively accomplish our law enforcement mission and, at the same time, advance our country’s well-being by recognizing the invaluable contributions of millions of individuals who are part of the fabric of our communities.  The guidelines will help us exercise our prosecutorial discretion to achieve justice.” 
The immigration enforcement guidelines require the protection of civil rights and civil liberties.  A noncitizen’s race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity, national origin, political associations, or exercise of First Amendment rights cannot be factors in deciding to take enforcement action.  For the first time, they explicitly guard against the use of immigration enforcement as a tool of retaliation for a noncitizen’s assertion of legal rights, such as the right to exercise workplace or tenant rights.  The guidelines make clear that immigration enforcement authority shall not be used as an instrument of unscrupulous employers seeking to exploit their employees’ immigration status. 
Continuous training, a process to review their effective implementation, extensive data collection, and a case review process will all be required. 
The new guidelines replace the interim priorities issued by ICE Acting Director Tae Johnson in February and become effective November 29, 2021.  Secretary Mayorkas is expected to issue additional immigration-related policy memos in the coming weeks.

A Guide to Title 42 Expulsions at the Border
NOTE: On May 11, 2023, the Secretary of Health and Human Services terminated the COVID-19 Public Health emergency in effect since March 2020, thus ending the use of Title 42 as a border policy.

The United States has long guaranteed the right to seek asylum to individuals who arrive at our southern border and ask for protection. But since March 20, 2020, that fundamental right has been largely suspended. Beginning on that date, both migrants seeking a better life in the United States and those wanting to apply for asylum have been turned away and “expelled” back to Mexico or their home countries. These border expulsions are carried out under a little-known provision of U.S. health law—section 265 of Title 42—which the former Trump administration invoked to achieve its long-desired goal of shutting the border to asylum seekers. Over 1.8 million expulsions under Title 42 have been carried out since the pandemic began. However, nearly half of those expulsions were of the same people being apprehended and expelled back to Mexico multiple times. This is because Title 42 has led to a significant increase in repeat crossings at the border. Half of all single adults from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador who have been expelled to Mexico under Title 42 have been apprehended crossing the border again. As a result, Title 42 has significantly increased overall border crossings. In fact, 1 in 3 apprehensions since Title 42 expulsions began have been of a person on at least their second attempt to cross the border. 
Despite the claim made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that this order was necessary from a public health perspective to protect the United States, public reporting has shown that the policy originated in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Trump White House. Reports indicate that CDC scientists expressed opposition to the invocation of Title 42, arguing that there was no public health rationale to support it. Ever since then, public health experts outside the CDC have continued to agree, arguing that while international borders largely remain open to other travelers, there is no need to turn away refugees and expel them to their home countries or Mexico.
The Biden administration kept Title 42 in place until April 2022, when the CDC announced that it no longer believed Title 42 was necessary for public health purposes. The CDC cited the widespread availability of rapid tests and vaccination for COVID-19 as measures sufficient to limit concerns about public health. The termination of Title 42 was set to go into effect on May 23, but a federal court in Louisiana blocked the Biden administration from doing so.iv As of the time of publication, Title 42 remains in effect following that court order.

There also are ongoing court battles as to whether expulsions under Title 42 were legal in the first place. In March 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals announced that it was unlawful to expel migrant families under Title 42 without giving them an opportunity to seek protection from persecution.
What is Title 42 and how did it go into place?
On March 20, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued an emergency regulation to implement a specific aspect of U.S. health law. Section 265 of U.S. Code Title 42 permits the Director of the CDC to “prohibit … the introduction” into the United States of individuals when the director believes that “there is serious danger of the introduction of [a communicable] disease into the United States.” The HHS regulation allows any customs officers—which includes officers of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) such as Border Patrol agents—to implement any such order issued by the CDC.
The same day, CDC Director Robert R. Redfield relied on this regulation to issue an order suspending the “introduction” into the United States of certain individuals who have been in “Coronavirus Impacted Areas.” The order targets individuals who have entered the United States from Canada or Mexico and “who would be introduced into a congregate setting” at a port of entry or in a Border Patrol station. This includes individuals who would normally be detained by CBP after arriving at the border, including asylum seekers, unaccompanied children, and people attempting to enter the United States without inspection. Citing the new CDC order, that same day the Border Patrol began “expelling” individuals who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border without giving them the opportunity to seek asylum.
The CDC order does not apply to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their spouses and children, nor does it apply to U.S. military personnel or those who arrive at a port of entry with valid travel documents, although the CDC maintains that it has the authority to expel U.S. citizens under Title 42 if it chooses. The CDC order also includes an exemption for anyone that DHS determines should be allowed into the United States on “consideration of significant law enforcement, officer and public safety, humanitarian, and public health interests.”
On September 11, 2020, HHS published the final version of the March interim regulation enabling the CDC Director to issue orders suspending the “introduction” of people at the border. In the final version of the regulation, the CDC acknowledged for the first time that its order is being used to turn away refugees and asylum seekers and declared its belief that doing so was legal. This was followed by a new CDC order in October 2020 which was largely the same as the March order and reinforced the government’s plan to continue expelling people encountered at the southern border.
The CDC’s order has been modified five times since the Biden administration took office, including the April 1, 2022, order to terminate Title 42 expulsions in May, which is currently on hold due to a court order. On February 2, 2021, the CDC issued a notice temporarily exempting unaccompanied children from expulsion. Following a “reassessment” of public health protocols, on July 16, 2021, the CDC again formalized this exemption for unaccompanied children. On August 2, 2021, the CDC replaced the October 2020 order with a new order continuing Title 42 expulsions while exempting unaccompanied children. On March 12, 2022, the CDC formally terminated Title 42 for unaccompanied children in response to a court order overturning the exemption.
How has Title 42 been implemented at the border?
Under an agreement reached with the Mexican government in late March 2020, the Border Patrol began sending to Mexico most Mexican, Guatemalan, Honduran, and Salvadoran families and single adults encountered at the southern border. The group of nationalities subject to expulsion to Mexico remained unchanged until May 2022, when the Biden administration reached an agreement with Mexico to accept “thousands” of Cubans and Nicaraguans as well. Despite this agreement, there has been extensive documentation of individuals expelled to Mexico who do not fit within this category, including Haitian asylum seekers. People expelled are usually driven by bus to the nearest port of entry and told to walk back to Mexico, often without their luggage and other belongings. Since late January 2021, the Mexican state of Tamaulipas (which borders South Texas) has barred CBP from expelling families with children under the age of seven. In response, CBP has carried out “lateral” transfers by plane or bus to other locations along the border, such as El Paso, where Mexican authorities will allow the agency to expel families with young children. However, because the capacity to carry out “lateral flights” is limited, CBP has been forced to release the majority of families who cross the border in South Texas, despite President Biden’s prior insistence that he would expel all families if he could.
People who are subject to Title 42 are not given an opportunity to contest their expulsion on the grounds that they would face persecution in the country to which they will be expelled. There is an extraordinarily limited exception to Title 42 for people who “spontaneously” inform CBP officers that they fear being tortured in the country to which they will be expelled. However, in order to receive an official screening by an asylum officer for exemption under that provision, the CBP officer must first determine that the claim is “reasonably believable.” From March 2020 through September 2021, just 3,217 people were screened for torture prior to being expelled, and only 272 people were granted an exemption and permitted to seek asylum.
Those subject to Title 42 who aren’t sent to Mexico are held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or CBP detention and flown back to their home countries without any opportunity to seek asylum. For example, since Title 42 expulsions began, over 18,000 Haitian nationals seeking asylum have been subjected to this process and summarily returned to Haiti. Flights to Haiti were briefly suspended in summer 2021 after an outcry following President Biden’s inauguration. In September 2021, over the objections of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as advocacy groups and many Democratic members of Congress, the Biden administration expelled by plane more than 8,000 Haitians who had sought asylum after crossing the border near Del Rio, Texas.
Individuals who are expelled do not receive an order of deportation, but CBP collects their biometrics and records their contact with the agency. It is unclear how this information will be used in the future, or how it may impact an individual’s ability to seek protection in the United States once the Title 42 policy is ultimately terminated.
Title 42 not only applies to individuals crossing the border between ports of entry, but also applies equally to individuals seeking asylum at ports of entry. In March 2020, as part of Title 42, CBP stopped processing all asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry and ask for humanitarian protection. This left nearly 15,000 people in limbo who had been waiting on lists for an opportunity to request asylum at ports of entry (a practice known as “metering”).
Before the practice of expelling unaccompanied children was blocked in court and then later formally ended by the Biden administration, CBP used Title 42 to turn away and expel nearly 16,000 unaccompanied children.xl These expulsions took place despite provisions of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act which require the government to protect children who arrive at the border without a parent or legal guardian.
Through the end of April 2022, the Border Patrol carried out more than 1.87 million expulsions.xlii From April 2020 through April 2022, 60.5% of encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border led to an expulsion.

It is important to keep in mind that, just because a person is processed under “normal immigration law” and not expelled, that does not mean they are released into the United States. Thousands are subject to “expedited removal” or have a prior order of deportation reinstated. Many people who are not expelled are instead sent to ICE detention, where they may seek asylum through the credible fear process (CFI). Similarly, roughly 1 in 10 people encountered after crossing the border are unaccompanied children who are sent to federal shelters. At no point have more than a third of people apprehended after crossing been directly released at the border (see Figure 2).

What have public health experts said about Title 42?
Despite the claim that Title 42 is needed to protect against the spread of COVID-19, many public health experts have called for an end to the practice of border expulsions. Starting as early as May 2020, and continuing to the present, public health leaders have called on the CDC to lift the order. According to the experts, the fundamental problem with Title 42 expulsions is that they are targeted primarily at a small number of people seeking asylum at a time when other restrictions in place at ports of entry have been lifted and large numbers of people cross the border daily.
In a letter to the Biden administration in September 2021, public health experts noted that the risk of infection from COVID-19 could be mitigated at the border with “social distancing, providing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), ensuring frequent testing, and offering vaccination” to migrants.xlvi The experts also asserted that Title 42 expulsions themselves could pose a public health threat given that people are detained together “for days to weeks prior to transporting them” for expulsions, which heightens “the risk of COVID-19 transmission across national borders.”
How has Title 42 affected asylum seekers?
Title 42 has led to the mass expulsion of thousands of asylum seekers, including those in desperate straits. Many individuals have been sent back to persecution in their home countries or forced to wait in Mexico for a time when the border will reopen to those seeking asylum. Over 215,000 parents and children have been expelled together since the restrictions went into place.
After the Biden administration took office, Mexican officials in the state of Tamaulipas, which borders South Texas, began refusing to permit CBP to expel families with children under the age of seven, citing a new law relating to the treatment of migrant children. As a result, more families are now being admitted to the United States rather than expelled. These families are generally provided with COVID-19 tests and are connected with local nonprofit organizations which help secure transportation to their ultimate destination or a place to quarantine if necessary.
Asylum seekers expelled back to Mexico are often targeted by criminal cartels for violence and extortion. Advocates have documented through surveys and public media coverage nearly 10,000 reports of violence against migrants expelled back to Mexico under Title 42. Hundreds of parents, fearing for the lives of their children, have chosen to self-separate and send their children across the border alone, knowing they will be safer in the United States than in northern Mexico.
Some asylum seekers are expelled back to their home countries, which are the very same countries from which they fled persecution. For instance, over 7,000 Haitians have been expelled back to Haiti after arriving at the U.S. border since September 19. Other asylum seekers have been expelled to southern Mexico, where the Mexican government then expels them to Guatemala in a process of “chain expulsions.” The United Nations has expressed concerns that this practice is a violation of international law.
However, not all migrants seeking asylum are expelled. Rising numbers of people from countries other than Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador have been permitted to seek asylum in the United States because Mexico will not allow the Biden administration to expel them back to Mexico. Many of these individuals are sent to ICE detention centers, and during the initial months of the Biden administration the number of people sent to detention from the border rose significantly.
As a result, the outcome for asylum seekers crossing the border can vary wildly and depends more on their nationality and their family status than on any policies or laws inside the United States.
How Has Title 42 Affected Border Crossings?
Despite claims that Title 42 is necessary for immigration deterrence purposes, it has actually had the counterproductive effect of significantly increasing the number of arrests at the border. That is because, under Title 42, individuals who are expelled to Mexico within hours after being apprehended at the border can simply try again a second or third time in hopes of getting through. Some individuals have made dozens of failed attempts to cross the border and been turned back under Title 42 each time. This increase in apprehensions has been seen most among single adults who are not seeking asylum.
Before the pandemic began, just 7% of people arrested at the border had crossed the border more than once. But by October 2020, 38% of all people arrested had crossed the border multiple times that year. In Fiscal Year 2021, 1 in 3 people apprehended at the border had already crossed the border at least once that year. This has led to a dramatic shift in the demographics of border arrests, with the number of encounters of single adults rising every month from April 2020 through May 2021, reaching levels not seen in over a decade (see Figure 3).

Single adult apprehensions vs. family unit and unaccompanied child apprehensions

Because many people cross the border repeatedly after having been expelled under Title 42, the number of border encounters reported to the public greatly overstates the number of people who are crossing the border. In the 19-month period from the start of Fiscal Year 2021 through April 2022, there were over 900,000 “repeat encounters,” meaning that 1 in 3 border encounters was of a person on their second or higher attempt to cross the border (see Figure 4).
Among some groups, recidivism rates are even higher. According to DHS, half of all single adults from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador who are expelled back to Mexico under Title 42 are later arrested on a subsequent attempt to cross the border. And because not every person is apprehended on their second attempt, that means that more than half of individuals expelled to Mexico will cross the border at least one additional time.

Cybersecurity
The Department of Homeland Security and its components play a lead role in strengthening cybersecurity resilience across the nation and sectors, investigating malicious cyber activity, and advancing cybersecurity alongside our democratic values and principles.
President Biden has made cybersecurity a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration at all levels of government. To advance the President’s commitment, and to reflect that enhancing the nation’s cybersecurity resilience is a top priority for DHS, Secretary Mayorkas issued a call for action dedicated to cybersecurity in his first month in office. This call for action focused on tackling the immediate threat of ransomware and on building a more robust and diverse workforce.
In March 2021, Secretary Mayorkas outlined his broader vision and a roadmap for the Department’s cybersecurity efforts in a virtual address hosted by RSA Conference, in partnership with Hampton University and the Girl Scouts of the USA.

ETIAS
Travel authorisation for visa-exempt travellers to enter Europe
Official ETIAS website
Important notice
The European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)
is currently not in operation and no applications for travel authorisations are collected at this point.
Applicants will be able to apply via an official website and/or app for mobile devices prior to the start of operation of ETIAS and will have to pay a fee of €7.
The date from which travellers will be able to apply will be published on this web site.
Please refer to the memo (PDF)
for additional questions and answers on ETIAS.
How ETIAS functions
ETIAS
will be a largely automated IT system created to identify security, irregular migration or high epidemic risks posed by visa-exempt visitors travelling to the Schengen States, whilst at the same time facilitate crossing borders for the vast majority of travellers who do not pose such risks. Non-EU nationals who do not need a visa to travel to the Schengen area will have to apply for a travel authorisation through the ETIAS system prior to their trip. The information gathered via ETIAS will allow, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection principles, for advance verification of potential security, irregular migration of high epidemic risks.
After filling in an online application form, the system will conduct checks against EU information systems for borders and security and, in the vast majority of cases, issue a travel authorisation within minutes. In limited cases, where further checks on the traveller are needed, the issuing of the travel authorisation could take up to 30 days. The ETIAS travel authorisation will be a mandatory pre-condition for entry to the Schengen States. It will be checked together with the travel documents by the border guards when crossing the EU border. This prior verification of visa exempt non-EU citizens will facilitate border checks; avoid bureaucracy and delays for travellers when presenting themselves at the borders; ensure a coordinated and harmonised risk assessment of third-country nationals; and substantially reduce the number of refusals of entry at border crossing points.
Thanks to ETIAS authorities will receive vital information necessary to assess potential risks with individuals travelling to the EU and, if required, a travel authorisation could be denied. Schengen participating States will be able to manage their external borders more effectively and improve internal security. Travellers will have early indication of their admissibility to the Schengen States, making legal travel across Schengen borders easier.
The European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA) is responsible for developing the system. ETIAS will start being operational in mid-2025. The ETIAS Regulation provides for transitional measures to ensure a smooth roll out of the system.
Background
ETIAS is among the measures undertaken as part of the Security Union. It will also help to achieve the objectives of the European Agenda on Security
and the European Agenda on Migration
in particular regarding border management and preventing cross-border crime and terrorism.
The European Commission first introduced the idea of a ETIAS in April 2016 in the Communication ""Stronger and Smarter Information Systems for Borders and Security"" and adopted the proposal on 16 November 2016. After negotiations with the European Parliament and the Council the ETIAS Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 was adopted on 12 September 2018 and entered into force on 9 October 2018.

20 Years After 9/11: The State of the Transportation Security Administration
David P. Pekoske Administrator,Transportation Security Administration
House Committee on Homeland Security
Wednesday, September 29, 2021
As Prepared for Delivery
Good morning Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko and distinguished members of the Committee. I am honored to appear before you today to recognize the 20th anniversary of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and share our progress and substantial accomplishments over the last 20 years.
September 11, 2001 is one of the darkest days in our Nation’s history. Even still, the American people emerged from these horrific events more united than ever. In the aftermath of that dreadful day, TSA was created to safeguard the United States against another 9/11-type attack by strengthening the security of our Nation’s transportation systems while also ensuring freedom of movement for people and commerce.
Founding and Congressional Support
TSA was established by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which was signed into lawon November 19, 2001. With the enactment of ATSA, TSA assumed the significant challenge of protecting our Nation’s transportation systems from terrorist threats. There was no blueprint for this urgent and immense task. The early leaders of TSA built the organization one day at a time, initiating valuable relationships with international, industry, governmental, and private sector partners.
The agency was created to oversee security in all modes of transportation, but aviation security was at the forefront of the Nation’s mind after the 9/11 attack. ATSA required TSA to deploy federal security screeners to inspect airline passengers, their baggage, and air cargo; expanded the Federal Air Marshal Service; and required reinforced cockpit doors among many things designed to enhance transportation security. Additionally, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act (9/11 Act) required TSA to implement the recommendations of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, such as requiring 100% air cargo screening on passenger aircraft departing the country. Finally, through the TSA Modernization Act of 2018 (TSA Mod Act), the agency’s first comprehensive reauthorization since its inception, TSA was further authorized to expand field operational testing of advanced screening technologies, increase the usage of canine resources, enhance public area security, and improve the security of passengers, cargo, cockpits, cabins, surface transportation, and foreign airports.
This November, TSA will mark 20 years since its formation. TSA’s mission and focus began with the urgent task of preventing another 9/11-style attack on the Homeland, but its operations have expanded and evolved across the entire transportation landscape, from aviation to surface and the physical and cyber domains. As we approach this milestone, Congress’ continued support remains essential to ensure TSA can respond to this dynamic threat landscape, and I am committed to working with you to ensure TSA has the authorities and resources needed to both respond to emerging threats and support its workforce.
Changing Threat Landscape
TSA’s mandate is not only to mitigate the threats of today but to preempt evolving threats as our adversaries continue to adapt and evolve their tactics and methods. In the 2000s, we witnessed hijackers using planes as weapons, and we saw unique methods in attempts to conceal explosives in items like shoes, underwear, and soft drinks. In the 2010s, we witnessed explosives hidden in electronics and attacks on the public side of the airport. Now, in the 2020s, we face new and extremely sophisticated threats from state and non-state actors, ranging from cyberattacks to concerns about hostile and non-hostile unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in addition to traditional threats. From January 2018 through August 2021, there were 2,476 UAS events reported to TSA affecting all modes of transportation. From the beginning of 2021 through the end of August, there has been a 169 percent increase in UAS sightings in the domestic aviation environment, requiring 31 aircraft evasive actions. We are not only focused on elaborate plots and large-scale attacks but also on current threats, which could come from domestic violent extremists as well as insiders. While the threat landscape has grown more complicated over the years, one thing has not changed – we still face ambitious adversaries who are intensely focused on finding a point of attack and waiting for opportunity.
We have also faced another unprecedented and unexpected adversary – a global pandemic. If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it is that we must remain vigilant and adapt quickly, because not all threats look the same. And just like 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the future of transportation.
Fortunately, agility is part of our DNA. When TSA was created, it was done with the express purpose of forming an entrepreneurial agency that could remain nimble in its approach to protecting our nation’s transportation systems. From the beginning, our workforce has been taught to anticipate and prepare for the unexpected. When our officers report to the checkpoint each day, the only thing they know for sure is that the upcoming day will be different than the one before. That mentality extends to the top of the organization, where our leaders know that our adversaries are still committed to doing us harm, and we must remain vigilant, innovative, and agile.
Today, TSA relies on intelligence to develop and implement its approach to security and works closely with transportation, law enforcement, and intelligence partners to set the international standard for excellence in transportation security. Since the agency’s formation, TSA has implemented a robust series of security procedures, developed a workforce well-trained in threat mitigation, and sought and implemented state-of-the-art technologies to screen passengers, baggage, and air cargo. The agency’s security measures are continually evaluated and enhanced by experts to address evolving threats, including those potentially emanating from air cargo, while preserving individual rights and freedoms. TSA is developing an Air Cargo Security Roadmap, which is a strategic plan drafted in collaboration with key industry and other Federal partners with equity in air cargo. The Roadmap will outline TSA's strategic direction toward modernizing, streamlining, and further securing the air cargo ecosystem over the next five years.
While TSA is best known for aviation security, it also plays a key role in protecting the Nation’s surface transportation networks – mass transit and passenger rail, freight rail, highway and motor carrier, pipeline, and maritime. Following the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, TSA helped lead the Department’s efforts to improve baseline cybersecurity requirements for the pipeline sector through the issuance of two Security Directives. These directives are complementary to the TSA and CISA efforts in the Pipeline Cybersecurity Initiative. TSA, along with CISA, Coast Guard, and interagency stakeholders, continues to identify opportunities to use existing authorities and private sector relationships to improve cybersecurity and information sharing across all modes of transportation. We actively work across all surface modes to enhance intelligence information sharing with our partners so we can collaboratively address security issues unique to the mode of transportation, such as the Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee (STSAC) recommendation to stand up a Surface Information Sharing Cell. The tremendous challenge of protecting our Nation’s surface transportation systems and pipeline security infrastructure from physical and cyber-based threats is not new; and it will continue to be one of the most persistent threats in the future. To that end, in September 2020, the TSA Security Training Rule, a 9/11 Act requirement, became effective. This regulation, which had been in the rulemaking process for many years, requires owners /operators of higher-risk freight railroad carriers, public transportation agencies (including rail mass transit and bus systems), passenger railroad carriers and over-the-road bus companies to provide TSA-approved security training to employees who perform security-sensitive functions. Additionally, TSA is currently drafting a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the vetting of frontline public transportation and railroad surface transportation employees.
Our Workforce
Over the last 20 years, TSA’s workforce has become an extremely professional, highly skilled, and proactive workforce of approximately 60,000 people. I am appreciative of and remain committed to the TSA workforce, and am proud of everything the agency has accomplished because of their efforts. I consider it a great privilege to serve alongside such a dedicate group of individuals. We continue to see tremendous efforts by our frontline screening officers, Federal Air Marshals, inspectors, canine handlers, vetting personnel, and all of those who support TSA’s mission.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has tested our resiliency, TSA has adapted and maintained its security posture while also working to ensure the health and safety of both our employees and the traveling public. This has been accomplished through distributing critical personal protective equipment, adjusting procedures to accommodate social distancing, and integrating of technologies that decrease the need for touch points between officers, passengers, and their property. TSA also issued and subsequently extended mask requirements in U.S. transportation systems until January 18, 2022. Effective Friday, September 10, 2021, TSA increased the range of civil penalties that may be charged against individuals who violate this federal mask mandate in U.S. transportation systems. The new range of penalties will be $500-$1,000 for first offenders and $1,000-$3,000 for second offenders.
TSA is also investing in its workforce by working to address longstanding workforce challenges, which were highlighted in the Blue-Ribbon Panel of public and private sector human capital experts I commissioned in 2018. Pursuant to its ATSA authorities, TSA has developed three initiatives to enhance TSA officer compensation and make career progression more transparent: Service Pay, Career Progression, and Model Officer Recognition. Service Pay provides a predictable annual salary increase that acknowledges enhanced experience and skill mastery. The next phase of Career Progression, being implemented this year, will provide a one-time pay increase for eligible E-Band officers who successfully complete certain advanced skills training and take on additional responsibilities. Finally, the Model Officer Recognition program identifies and rewards TSA’s top officers in all pay bands with monetary and non-monetary awards or pay increases for their ongoing contributions to the mission. We are also leveraging funding to launch efforts to recruit new employees in support of screening operations at many of TSA’s approximately 430 federalized airports nationwide. We will continue to pursue focused veteran and military recruitment and outreach to help fill these and other important positions. Finally, TSA is committed to workforce protections, expanding collective bargaining at the national level, and ensuring that TSA’s standards and processes adhere to the principles applied by the Merit Systems Protection Board. TSA continues to review options within existing authorities to achieve these goals and expand items covered by the collective bargaining agreement.
Historically, TSA employees have received limited pay progression due to budget constraints. Recent initiatives such as Transportation Security Officer (TSO) Service Pay and TSO Career Progression have, however, increased compensation to compensate TSA employees at a level more commensurate with the tremendous responsibility they bear for the security of our transportation system.
TSA is committed to fostering a fair and equitable workplace and fostering diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organization, including within many of our highest-ranking positions. To achieve this, TSA formed an Inclusion Action Committee (IAC) devoted to strengthening our diversity and sustaining an \inclusive culture to further empower and engage our employees. Consistent with President Biden’s Executive Order on Preventing and Combatting Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, and based on an IAC recommendation, TSA issued a Management Directive and accompanying Handbook in April 2021. This guidance provides policy and procedures for addressing the needs and issues that arise for transitioning and transgender TSA officers, as well as TSA’s equal opportunity and nondiscrimination policy as it relates to these employees and applicants for employment. TSA is at its best when all employees feel valued and are fully engaged to outmatch dynamic threats, committed adversaries, and evolving circumstances.
Evolution of Airport Security & Screening
TSA’s airport screening process is intelligence-driven and applies a risk-based strategy that establishes security practices to expedite screening for known and trusted travelers at security checkpoints while focusing resources on high-risk and unknown passengers. TSA screens more than one million passengers daily, on average, and more than two million daily before the COVID-19 pandemic through TSA’s Secure Flight passenger vetting system, introduced in 2009.
TSA’s security strategy also includes other vetting activities. To address risks associated with Insider Threats, TSA vets more than 25 million transportation workers daily against the Terrorist Watchlist, including airport workers, airline flight crewmembers, mariners, commercial drivers who haul hazardous materials, and cargo screeners and handlers. In December 2020, TSA established the TSA Insider Threat Mitigation Hub to mature and expand the capabilities of the Insider Threat Program to enhance the ability to deter, detect, and mitigate insider threats to transportation. TSA also vets students who enroll in training through FAA-certified flight training providers and the entire Airman Registry against changes or updates to the Terrorist Watchlist. To improve the vetting process, TSA has implemented the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recurrent criminal history vetting service known as “Rap Back” to provide near real-time updates to an aviation worker’s criminal history, representing a significant improvement to threat mitigation. With all of our screening and vetting programs, we work to ensure that there are appropriate redress mechanisms in place to ensure the protection of travelers’ civil rights and civil liberties.
TSA also works closely with its international partners to share best practices, techniques, and technologies, and to collaborate and facilitate measures to harmonize mutual aviation security goals for the safety of travelers. Air cargo is more secure than it has ever been with 100 percent of cargo on flights departing U.S. airports to international locations screened or secured, consistent with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO’s) updated standards. TSA also established the Third-Party Canine-Cargo (3PK9-C) program to enhance the screening of air cargo by leveraging the capabilities of third-party explosives detection canine teams.
Technology Advancements
Since TSA’s inception, we have continuously refined our security approach by examining the procedures and technologies we use to secure our Nation’s transportation systems. The introduction of new technologies has played a significant role in how airport security has evolved and been enhanced over the past 20 years as industry develops new methods to help TSA detect threats to the aviation sector. As we look to the future, TSA strives to remain the recognized global leader of transportation security by focusing on capability innovation and threat-informed, information-driven operations. A number of improved technologies and enhancements that TSA has recently introduced provide significant advancements over existing equipment used for identity verification and the screening of individuals and their accessible property while also reducing contact during screening to improve the passenger experience. These key technologies include:
Computed Tomography, or CT, which produces high-quality 3-D images that can be rotated up to 360 degrees on three axes for a more thorough visual analysis of a carry-on bag’s contents. It also reduces the need to touch or manually check bags.
Credential Authentication Technology, or CAT, machines automatically verify identification documents presented by passengers during the security screening process and confirm a passenger’s flight information and vetting status without the need for our officers to see a boarding pass. TSA has worked to modify CAT machines to allow self-service operation, so passengers can scan their own photo ID without our Officers touching the document. Additionally, the Self-Service CAT with camera (CAT-2) upgrade units promote social distancing, reduce the need for a physical ID handoff at the Travel Document Checker (TDC), and make passenger screening more automated.
Advanced Imaging Technology, or AIT, safely screens passengers for both metallic and non-metallic threats such as weapons and explosives without physical contact. Enhancements have reduced the number of false alarms at the checkpoint by using even more sophisticated millimeter wave technology.
Biometrics and Identity Management
In addition to new and improved screening technologies, we are also investing in biometric technology, which adds an important layer to our security procedures. Biometrics are a powerful tool, such as to improve identity verification performance, but must be used carefully and with the utmost respect and safeguarding of passenger privacy. In our pilots, testing protocols always use a voluntary process for passengers choosing to go through using the biometric technology in addition to conducting passenger surveys about our technologies and their use. TSA’s CAT-2 uses facial matching technology that compares the live image of a passenger with the image on the passenger’s photo ID, never stores biometric information, and any information captured for one passenger is deleted by the time the next passenger approaches. TSA remains mindful that biometric systems may have error rates and tests such systems to ensure accurate performance across diverse demographic groups. A recently concluded DHS Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) test of the CAT-2 devices for match performance across demographic groups concluded that “no consistent statistically significant differences in performance across gender, race, and skin tone were observed across test conditions for the CAT-2 system.” Maintaining passenger equitability and dignity is an agency priority and new technologies, like CAT-2, should enhance both transportation security and the passenger experience.
Along with biometrics development, digital credentials, such as mobile driver’s licenses and digital passports, are becoming increasingly common. Mobile driver’s license technology can enable a more seamless airport security screening experience for travelers and TSA is working with industry and the public to find innovative ways mobile driver’s licenses can facilitate easier and faster transit through TSA checkpoints while complying with REAL ID Act of2005 requirements, enforcement of which was extended until May 3, 2023, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile driver’s license technology marks a major milestone for TSA to provide an additional level of convenience for the traveler by enabling more opportunities for touchless TSA airport security screening. Moving forward, TSA will continue to pursue innovative solutions that allow us to improve identity management while ensuring privacy and mitigating any potential risks that these new technologies may introduce. Technology advancements are just one part of TSA’s multi-layered approach to ensuring transportation security.
Partnerships
Protecting our Nation’s transportation systems requires robust partnerships and effective security operations across all modes of transportation. Similar to other security efforts, TSA considers engaging public and private partners vital to ensuring the safety and security of our transportation network. Due to our expansive scope of operation and influence, TSA works with: owners and operators of transportation systems, industry associations, manufacturers, advisory bodies (e.g., Aviation Security Advisory Committee and STSAC), Critical Infrastructure Government and Sector Coordinating Councils under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, and other government and quasi-governmental agencies (e.g., ICAO).
We are also extremely cognizant of the needs of passengers that use the transportation systems. TSA’s Disability and Multicultural Coalition alone coordinates with over 450 advocacy and community-based organizations representing diverse communities. Additionally, we continue to expand our cadre of Passenger Support Specialists to provide real-time support in successfully engaging with and screening our diverse traveler populations. The TSA Mod Act also advanced our partnerships in this area. We appreciate Congress’ direction as TSA continues to foster a culture that treats all passengers with dignity and respect.
TSA has always welcomed and actively pursued engagement and alignment with our partners, and we have always worked together toward our mutual objectives of keeping passengers, cargo, and goods secure while also ensuring a positive travel experience. We rely on our partnerships to help secure the national transportation system and will continue to develop them in the years ahead to enhance security across the whole of the surface transportation enterprise.
Closing
Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, and members of the Committee, I appreciate this opportunity, on the occasion of TSA’s 20th anniversary, to share the significant steps the agency has taken to meet the challenges of the ever-evolving security threat landscape. Our Homeland is stronger today than it was 20 years ago, and I am extremely proud of the hard work and achievements we have made since our founding. Today, I reaffirm our commitment to transportation security and assure you that we remain steadfast in our mission to protect the Nation's transportation systems and ensure the freedom of movement for people and commerce. Thank you for your continued support of TSA’s mission and the chance to appear before you today. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

COVID-19 Created New Challenges for Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Agencies
Posted on July 01, 2021
Immigration enforcement is the primary responsibility of 2 agencies within the Department of Homeland Security: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which secures U.S. borders, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which manages the nation’s immigration detention system. During the pandemic, these agencies faced new challenges including preventing the spread of COVID-19 among their workforce and noncitizen individuals held in immigration detention facilities.
Today’s WatchBlog post looks at our 2 new reports on how ICE and CBP adapted their operations in order to help protect staff and detainees from contracting COVID-19.
CBP’s and ICE’s roles
CBP is responsible for detecting and preventing people and goods from entering the U.S. illegally at and between ports of entry. ICE is responsible for providing safe, secure, and humane confinement for detained individuals in immigration court proceedings or with an order of removal from the United States.
How ICE protected detainees and staff from COVID-19
At the onset of the pandemic, ICE developed a series of requirements to help protect detainees and staff from the virus. The agency implemented new protocols for intake processing, screening and testing, and social distancing. For example, all detainees are required to receive COVID-19 testing within 12 hours of arrival and are placed in quarantine for 14 days. Some facility officials told us that they faced difficulties quarantining detainees due to infrastructure limitations. Additionally, detainee compliance with protection measures, such as wearing face masks, was an ongoing challenge reported by officials.
To monitor implementation of its new protocols, ICE administers recurring surveys to assess facility compliance with requirements. However, in our new report, we found that limited on-site presence posed a challenge for validating survey responses. In December 2020, ICE revised the survey and implemented an on-site compliance check to help address this challenge.
As of March, ICE confirmed more than 10,000 cases of COVID-19 and 8 deaths among detainees within detention facilities.
  How CBP protected its employees from COVID-19
CBP employees were at a high risk of exposure and infection from COVID-19 given their role in patrolling U.S. borders and inspecting individuals and goods at ports of entry. To help protect its employees from exposure, CBP updated guidance, implemented workplace flexibilities, and provided protective equipment for both employees and the public.
CBP reported some challenges. For example, starting in May 2020, CBP encounters with individuals steadily increased at the southwest border. As a result, the agency requested additional resources and restructured their operations to intercept the increasing number of individuals at the borders who could be infected.
According to data through February, over 27,000 CBP employees became infected or were unable to work due to related illness or quarantining, and 24 employees died.

The Department of Homeland Security Issues Withhold Release Order on Silica-Based Products Made by Forced Labor in Xinjiang
Release Date Thu, 06/24/2021
WASHINGTON — Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas announced that DHS’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a Withhold Release Order against Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Withhold Release Order instructs personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to immediately begin to detain shipments containing silica-based products made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries. 
“As President Biden made clear at the recent G7 summit, the United States will not tolerate modern-day slavery in our supply chains,” said Secretary Mayorkas. “This Withhold Release Order demonstrates we continue to protect human rights and international labor standards and promote a more fair and competitive global marketplace by fulfilling the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to ending forced labor.”
The Withhold Release Order applies to silica-based products made by Hoshine and its subsidiaries as well as to materials and goods (such as polysilicon) derived from or produced using those silica-based products. Silica is a raw material that is used to make components for solar panels, electronics, and other goods.  
“Forced labor is a human rights abuse that hurts vulnerable workers, weakens the global economy, and exposes consumers to unethically made merchandise,” said Troy Miller, CBP Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner. “CBP will continue to set a high global standard by aggressively investigating allegations of forced labor in U.S. supply chains and keeping tainted merchandise out of the United States.”   
CBP issued a Withhold Release Order based on information reasonably indicating that Hoshine uses forced labor to manufacture silica-based products. This Withhold Release Order was issued following an investigation into silica-based products imported into the United States from the Xinjiang region. During the investigation, CBP identified two of the International Labour Organization’s indicators of forced labor in Hoshine’s production process: intimidation and threats, and restriction of movement. 
During the 47th G7 summit earlier this month, the United States and G7 countries committed to removing forced labor from global supply chains. This Withhold Release Order on Hoshine is the latest in a series of actions the United States has taken to address forced labor and other human rights abuses against the Uyghur people and other ethnic and religious minorities in China’s Xinjiang region. Further, in June 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor added polysilicon from Xinjiang to its List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor and the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed additional license requirements on the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of goods from certain Xinjiang-based polysilicon producers due to concerns about those entities’ use of forced labor. More information about these efforts is available here.
Federal statute 19 U.S.C. 1307 prohibits the importation of merchandise produced, wholly or in part, by convict labor, forced labor, and/or indentured labor under penal sanctions, including forced or indentured child labor. CBP investigates allegations of forced labor in U.S. supply chains and issues Withhold Release Orders that instruct personnel at ports of entry to detain shipments that contain goods suspected of being made by forced labor. Withhold Release Orders are not outright bans. Pursuant to U.S. regulations, importers of detained shipments have an opportunity to demonstrate that the merchandise was not imported in violation of section 1307 or to export their shipments. 
CBP’s forced labor investigations have produced six Withhold Release Orders in Fiscal Year 2021, including one on cotton and tomato products from the Xinjiang region and another on cotton products originating from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Eight of the 13 Withhold Release Orders that CBP issued in Fiscal Year 2020 were on goods made by forced labor in China. The full list of Withhold Release Orders is available at CBP.gov. 
Any person or organization that has reason to believe that merchandise produced by forced labor is being, or is likely to be, imported into the United States can report detailed allegations to CBP via the e-Allegations Online Trade Violations Reporting System or by calling 1-800-BE-ALERT. 
  U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between official ports of entry. CBP is charged with securing the borders of the United States while enforcing hundreds of laws and facilitating lawful trade and travel.

Honoring Our Law Enforcement Colleagues During National Police Week
Release Date: May 10, 2021
May 10, 2021
08:34 am
Kathryn Coulter Mitchell
Men and women in uniform put their lives at risk every day to protect people and serve our communities. This week, National Police Week, we want to thank our colleagues in law enforcement for their service and recognize the sacrifices of the fallen.
This past year has been challenging for federal, state, local and tribal police forces. We’ve seen the news reports, we’ve mourned the great losses—particularly in our black, indigenous and people of color communities—and some policing practices have come under fire. With this great criticism comes great responsibility, and many departments across the country are looking inward and working with civic leaders to implement changes. We at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) applaud these important steps and are committed to using our research and development capacities to be part of both the conversations and the solutions.
With the spotlight fully shining on police policies, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), now really is the time to be proactive and address them head on. S&T is taking the lead in studying high-stress law enforcement interactions with the aim of developing best practices, improving policing policies, refining TTPs, and reforming training to better standards.
Last month, senior officials from S&T and 62 different groups—including the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute, police partners, George Mason University, several major law enforcement and community associations, and mental health professionals—participated in a two-week-long law enforcement simulation experiment (SIMEX) in Virginia.  
Funded by S&T, the DHS Office of Partnership and Engagement, the DHS Office for State and Local Law Enforcement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), and U.S. Secret Service, the SIMEX used virtual reality to simulate outdoor officer-civilian encounters, focusing on law enforcement’s applied use of force and the factors that go into officers’ decision-making processes when applying force.
Specifically, five factors were analyzed during the simulation: 1) suspect resistance; 2) whether or not a suspect was armed; 3) presence of mental health professionals; 4) suspect race; and 5) suspect mental state, to determine, in an evidence-based way, if these contribute to any differences in how an officer applies force. Results will provide law enforcement organizations evidence-based data to examine and evolve current TTPs and implement new ones.
S&T’s efforts do not stop there. We’re also working with FLETC to learn more about the personal interactions that occur during police encounters to identify methods and techniques that can de-escalate conflict. We are doing this by reviewing video footage of police encounters, coding them to classify behaviors and outcomes and detecting patterns that can inform future training. Following this project, S&T and FLETC will look at the possibility of developing an intelligent automated coding system that can be used by researchers and law enforcement agencies to further answer questions about complex social interactions that occur between officers and citizens. This information could help improve individual and departmental training on how to manage conflicts with civilians.
Thank you to all the men and women in law enforcement who put their lives on the line every day to protect ours. We at S&T salute you and will continue supporting you through our ongoing R&D efforts for first responders.

FACT SHEET
U.S. Citizen Children Impacted by Immigration Enforcement
Immigration 101Immigration RaidsEnforcementDetentionInterior Enforcement
June 24, 2021
Download PDF
with Citations
In the United States today, more than 16.7 million people share a home with at least one family member, often a parent, who is undocumented. Roughly six million of these people are children under the age of 18. Consequently, immigration enforcement actions—and the ever-present threat of enforcement action—have significant physical, emotional, developmental, and economic repercussions for millions of children across the country. Deportations of parents and other family members have serious consequences that affect children—including U.S.-citizen children—and extend to entire communities and the country as a whole.
This fact sheet provides an overview of the children who are impacted by immigration enforcement actions, the challenges and risk factors that these children face, and the existing mechanisms designed to protect children if a parent is detained or deported.
Millions of U.S.-citizen children have undocumented parents and family members.
4.4 million U.S.-citizen children under the age of 18 lived with at least one undocumented parent as of 2018.
6.1 million U.S.-citizen children under the age of 18 lived with an undocumented family member as of 2018.
As many as half-a-million U.S.-citizen children experienced the deportation of at least one parent from 2011 through 2013.
As of 2017, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti had an estimated 273,000 U.S.-citizen children. If these TPS designations are terminated, many of these parents will become undocumented.
17.8 million children in the United States had at least one foreign-born parent, including parents who were naturalized citizens, lawfully present immigrants, or undocumented immigrants, as of 2019.
Immigration enforcement—and the threat of enforcement—can negatively impact a child’s long-term health and development.
A child’s risk of experiencing mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and severe psychological distress increases following the detention and/or deportation of a parent. Since late 2016, doctors and service providers report having seen more children exhibiting stress- and anxiety-related behavioral changes, including symptoms of “toxic-stress,” due to fear that a family member will be deported.
Children experience toxic stress when they are suddenly separated from their parents, which negatively impacts brain development. They are also at greater risk of developing chronic mental health conditions that include depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as physical conditions such as cancer, stroke, diabetes, and heart disease.
A 2010 study of immigration-related parental arrests (at home or worksites) found that the majority of children experienced at least four adverse behavioral changes in the six months following a raid or arrest. Compared to the previous six months, children cried or were afraid more often; changed their eating or sleeping habits; and/or were more anxious, withdrawn, clingy, angry, or aggressive.
A 2020 study found that the detention or deportation of a family member was associated with significantly higher rates of suicidal thought, alcohol use, and aggression among Latino adolescents in Atlanta, Georgia.
A 2020 study examined the impact on children, families, and communities of worksite raids in Ohio, Texas, and Mississippi. The study found that many of the children of workers swept up in the raids exhibited signs of PTSD, including difficulty sleeping, frequent crying, and heightened fear. 
Even before birth, immigration enforcement can put a child’s health at risk. The 2008 worksite raid in Postville, Iowa (the largest single-site immigration raid in U.S. history) was tied to premature and underweight births—complications that put babies at risk for infant death or long-term health problems. Researchers found that babies born to Latina mothers in Iowa within 37 weeks of the raid were 24 percent more likely to be underweight compared to births over the same amount of time one year earlier. This increased risk was not evident in babies born to non-Latina white mothers in Iowa.
Fear and uncertainty among immigrant families leads to decreased participation in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In turn, lack of health coverage through Medicaid/CHIP can hinder a child’s healthy growth and development and threaten a family’s financial stability. U.S.-citizen children with at least one parent who is an immigrant are more likely than children with U.S.-born parents to be uninsured.
Children who reside in communities that partner with ICE or are the focus of ICE raids experience negative educational outcomes.
Communities with local law enforcement agencies that choose to partner with ICE by entering into 287(g) agreements experience a large displacement of Hispanic students as families choose to leave or avoid moving into those communities. A Stanford University study analyzing the effects of 287(g) agreements on public school enrollment found that when local communities entered into 287(g) agreements between 2005 and 2010, the number of Hispanic students decreased nearly 10 percent within 2 years.
Large-scale raids by ICE can impact school attendance for students with friends or family members affected by raids. After a mass raid in eastern Tennessee occurred in April 2018, more than 500 students were absent from school the following day.
Educators surveyed in 2017 and 2018 reported several concerns related to immigration enforcement, including student absences, decline in academic performance, and less involvement from parents. Eighty-four percent of educators said students from immigrant families expressed concerns about enforcement while at school.
A 2020 study analyzed the educational outcomes of Latino students in school districts located in communities where large numbers of deportations were taking place. The study found that the number of deportations occurring in the larger community correlated with greater gaps between white and Latino students in terms of math achievement and chronic absenteeism.
The detention or deportation of a parent puts children at risk of economic instability.
The deportation, and even the arrest or detention, of a parent or other household member has significant short- and long-term financial implications. U.S.-citizen children and any remaining family members can face substantial economic disadvantages following the removal of a primary provider. In general, increases in immigration enforcement have been linked to higher poverty rates among U.S.-citizen children with parents who are likely to be undocumented.
A study of immigration enforcement in six U.S. locations between 2006 and 2009 found that families lost 40 to 90 percent of their income, or an average of 70 percent, within six months of a parent’s immigration-related arrest, detention, or deportation.
The ability to afford housing may become more tenuous following the deportation of a provider, resulting in the loss of a family’s home and more frequent relocations.
A 2016 study of immigration enforcement and housing foreclosures found that “deportations exacerbate rates of foreclosure among Latinos by removing income earners from owner-occupied households.” Furthermore, the research revealed that counties with 287(g) agreements, which authorize immigration enforcement collaboration between local police and ICE, had substantially higher foreclosure rates among Latinos.
An analysis of 2018 Census data found that when households lose the income of an undocumented family member, the family’s income falls by as much as 45 percent. An estimated 908,891 households with at least one U.S.-citizen child would fall below the poverty line if the undocumented breadwinners in those families were deported.
Children may end up in the child welfare system following the detention or deportation of a parent.
Parents—regardless of immigration status, detention, or deportation—have a constitutional right to custody of their children (unless deemed unfit). While the child welfare system generally recognizes that it is in a child’s best interest to remain with a parent or family member, immigration enforcement can negatively impact parental rights and thus a child’s well-being. For example, the lack of coordination between agencies has historically led to prolonged family separation and even termination of parental rights when a parent is detained or deported.
To ensure that enforcement activities did not “unnecessarily disrupt the parental rights” of parents or legal guardians of minor children, ICE issued its Parental Interests Directive in 2013. The Parental Interests Directive was replaced in 2017 with the Detained Parents Directive, which eliminated many aspects of the 2013 directive, including guidance for the use of prosecutorial discretion in cases involving children and all references to parental rights. The 2017 directive instead instructs ICE agents to “remain cognizant of the impact enforcement actions may have” on lawful permanent resident (LPR) or U.S.-citizen children.
According to ICE’s 2017 Detained Parents Directive, when LPR or U.S.-citizen minor children are encountered during immigration enforcement, ICE agents should “generally accommodate” the parent or legal guardian’s efforts to make childcare arrangements before contacting local child welfare or law enforcement to take temporary custody of the children.
If a parent is unable to arrange childcare or custody prior to detention or deportation, the child may be taken by the state’s Child Protective Services (CPS) for placement and case management. The child is usually placed in an emergency shelter, group home, or with a relative, friend, or stranger in a foster home while custody is determined in family court.
An estimated 5,000 children in foster care had a detained or deported parent in 2011, according to a national study.
Children in foster care in counties with 287(g) agreements were 29 percent more likely to have detained or deported parents compared to non-287(g) counties studied in 2011.
There are limited mechanisms to safeguard the parental rights of parents who are detained or deported.
All parents have the right to receive a notification of custody proceedings affecting their children, attend such proceedings, and receive copies of related court documents. Yet there are few enforceable, permanent policies in place to protect these rights for parents who are detained or deported.
Federal law mandates that parental rights be terminated if a child has been out of a parent’s custody for 15 of the past 22 months. Policies and procedures vary by state, but in order to maintain or regain parental rights, CPS generally implements a reunification plan that requires a parent to have regular contact with the child and participate in family court hearings. Detained or deported parents have historically faced significant barriers to these requirements.
Parents may request release from detention in order to care for their children while they are in immigration proceedings. However, ICE no longer provides its personnel with guidance for exercising such discretion in cases that involve a child.
The 2017 directive generally instructs agents to facilitate regular visitation for detained parents and their minor children, though it no longer emphasizes in-person visitation as opposed to visitation through video or teleconferencing. ICE personnel are also instructed to arrange for a detained parent's participation in custody proceedings when required by a court.
Significant issues persist for detained parents who may be dealing with both immigration and custody proceedings. Since ICE is not required to inform CPS of a parent’s whereabouts, CPS may have difficulty locating and properly notifying a detained parent; family courts and caseworkers may not understand why a parent is detained and unable to participate in proceedings; and ICE officials may underestimate the impact that enforcement has on U.S.-citizen children who are likely to be left behind.
Parents with a final deportation order must make the difficult decision of whether to bring their children—including U.S.-citizen children—with them.
From 2013 to 2018, ICE deported more than 231,000 people who reported having at least one U.S.-citizen child. In 2019, ICE deported 27,980 people with U.S.-born children. While the government does not track whether U.S.-citizen children stay in the United States or leave with a deported parent, both scenarios occur and pose challenges.
If parental rights remain intact, parents with a pending deportation may make custody arrangements for their children to stay in the United States. ICE is supposed to “accommodate, to the extent practicable,” a detained parent's efforts to make guardianship or travel arrangements for the child prior to deportation.
If a child’s custody is still being determined after a parent has been deported, the ability of the parent to regain custody or participate in proceedings—even if the court requires the parent’s attendance—is extremely limited. ICE no longer has guidance to consider facilitating the travel of a deported parent back to the United States to participate in proceedings that may result in the termination of parental rights.
Deported parents have the right to reunite with their children outside of the United States as long as the reunification plan is ongoing, but this requires significant coordination between family members, the parent country’s consulate, and U.S. state and federal agencies. It can be difficult for deported parents to prove that they can provide for their children in a stable and safe environment in the country of deportation, based on many of the same conditions that may have triggered the parent’s migration to the United States in the first place.

DHS Law Enforcement Components Did Not Consistently Collect DNA from Arrestees
Executive Summary
We determined DHS law enforcement components did not consistently collect DNA from arrestees as required.  Of the five DHS law enforcement components we reviewed that are subject to these DNA collection requirements, only Secret Service consistently collected DNA from arrestees.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Protective Service inconsistently collected DNA, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) collected no DNA.  DHS did not adequately oversee its law enforcement components to ensure they properly implemented DNA collection.  Based on our analysis, we project the DHS law enforcement components we audited did not collect DNA for about 212,646, or 88 percent, of the 241,753 arrestees from fiscal years 2018 and 2019.  Without all DHS arrestees’ DNA samples in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s criminal database, law enforcement likely missed opportunities to receive investigative leads based on DNA matches.  Additionally, DHS did not benefit from a unity of effort, such as sharing and leveraging processes, data collection, and best practices across components.  We recommended DHS oversee and guide its law enforcement components to ensure they comply with collection requirements.  DHS concurred with all four of our recommend.

DHS Inconsistently Implemented Administrative Forfeiture Authorities Under CAFRA
Executive Summary
DHS components used inconsistent processes for administrative forfeitures under the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA).  Specifically, we found inconsistencies among DHS components regarding the forms used to notify property owners and the process for responding to claims.  Further, CBP inappropriately used waivers to extend deadlines for responding to claims.  We recommended DHS implement a department-wide structure to oversee component forfeiture activities across DHS by designating an office at headquarters for this role.  Additionally, DHS should develop Department-wide policies and procedures, as well as review component policies, to ensure forfeiture processes and practices are consistent.  We made two recommendations to improve oversight across DHS and provide consistent processes for handling administrative forfeitures.  DHS concurred with recommendation two, which we consider resolved and open, but did not concur with recommendation one, which is unresolved and open.

DHS Has Limited Capabilities to Counter Illicit Unmanned Aircraft Systems
Executive Summary
DHS’ capability to counter illicit Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) activity remains limited.  The Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans did not execute a uniform department-wide approach, which prevented components authorized to conduct counter-UAS operations from expanding their capabilities.  This occurred because the Office of Policy did not obtain funding as directed by the Secretary to expand DHS’ counter-UAS capability.  We made four recommendations to improve the Department’s management and implementation of counter-UAS activities.  The Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans concurred with all four of our recommendations.

CBP, ICE, TSA, and Secret Service Have Taken Steps to Address Illegal and Prescription Opioid Use
Executive Summary
From fiscal years 2015 through 2018, in the midst of a growing opioid epidemic, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, and U.S. Secret Service appropriately disciplined employees whose drug test results indicated illegal opioid use, based on their employee standards of conduct and tables of offenses and penalties.  Additionally, during the same time period, components have either implemented or are taking steps to evaluate whether employees using prescription opioids can effectively conduct their duties.  For example, components have established policies prohibiting the use of prescription opioids that may impact an employee’s ability to work, in addition to requiring employees to report such prescription opioid use.  They have also implemented or are in the process of implementing measures to evaluate the fitness for duty of employees using prescription opioids.  These policies establish consistent standards components can use to ensure they are allowing employees to use legally-prescribed opioids, while also ensuring their workforce is capable of effectively performing their duties.  We made two recommendations to improve components’ oversight of illegal and prescription opioid use by employees.  CBP and Secret Service concurred with the recommendations, which are both resolved and open.

Congressman Tony Gonzales Secures Funds for Border Security, Cybersecurity and Emergency Management in Appropriations Bill
July 28, 2021
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Tony Gonzales (TX-23) secured funds for border security, cyber security infrastructure and emergency management for Texas’s 23rd Congressional District in the FY2022 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. 
Congressman Gonzales helped to include funding for a variety of border security initiatives across the district: 
$90 million for Operation Stonegarden to provide grant money for local and state law enforcement agencies to assist border patrol with their enforcement duties combatting drug and human trafficking. 
Congressman Gonzales introduced an amendment to increase funding for Operation Stonegarden from $90 million to $300 million. This was rejected by the Democrats in the final bill.
$132 million for new border security technology, including:
$50 million for non-intrusive imaging technology.
$50 million for border technology.
$45 million for innovative technology.
$10 million for port of entry technology.
$655 million for the construction and modernization of Land Ports of Entry
“I am excited to secure funding for Operation Stonegarden and provide crucial resources, support and equipment to our hardworking law enforcement and border patrol agents on the front lines,” said Congressman Gonzales. “However, this version of the bill significantly reduces funding to CBP and ICE – something we cannot afford to do. These significant funding cuts are unacceptable, especially as these agencies struggle to deal with a 20-year high in migration.” 
Congressman Gonzales helped to include funding for a variety of cyber and infrastructure security initiatives across the district: 
$1.165 billion Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
$705 million for the Urban Area Security Initiative to assist high-threat, high-density urban areas, such as San Antonio, in efforts to prepare and respond to acts of terrorism.
$90 million for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to support physical security enhancements of nonprofit organizations that are at high risk of terrorist attack.
$370 million for Assistance to Firefighter Grants.
$2.42 billion for Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
$186.7 million for cybersecurity.
$21.1 million for infrastructure security.
$34 million for emergency communications.
$17.1 million for integrated operations.
$13.7 million for risk management operations.
$13 million for stakeholder engagement and requirements; and
$3 million for mission support activities.
“These funds will help support critical cyber and infrastructure security initiatives to aid risk management operations across the district,” said Congressman Gonzales. “Through these initiatives, our communities will be better prepared against acts of terrorism, ransomware attacks or other emergencies.”

Criminal Noncitizen Statistics
The following is a summary of U.S. Border Patrol enforcement actions related to arrests of criminal noncitizens for Fiscal Years 2017 - 2024.
Records checks of available law enforcement databases following the apprehension of an individual may reveal a history of criminal conviction(s). That conviction information is recorded in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection database, from which the data below is derived.
  Arrests of Individuals with Criminal Convictions
The term “criminal noncitizens” refers to individuals who have been convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border Patrol; it does not include convictions for conduct that is not deemed criminal by the United States. Arrests of criminal noncitizens are a subset of total apprehensions by U.S. Border Patrol.
Arrest Type FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24YTD
U.S. Border Patrol Criminal Noncitizen Arrests 8,531 6,698 4,269 2,438 10,763 12,028 15,267 5,616
Fiscal Year 2024 runs October 1, 2023- September 30, 2024.
  Total Criminal Convictions by Type
This table organizes nationwide convictions of criminal noncitizens by type of criminal conduct. Because some criminal noncitizens may be convicted of multiple criminal offenses, total convictions listed below exceed the total arrests noted in the table above.
Conviction Type FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24YTD

Executive Order on Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border
HOME
BRIEFING ROOM
PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONS
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1.  Policy.  For generations, immigrants have come to the United States with little more than the clothes on their backs, hope in their hearts, and a desire to claim their own piece of the American Dream.  These mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters have made our Nation better and stronger.
The United States is also a country with borders and with laws that must be enforced.  Securing our borders does not require us to ignore the humanity of those who seek to cross them.  The opposite is true.  We cannot solve the humanitarian crisis at our border without addressing the violence, instability, and lack of opportunity that compel so many people to flee their homes.  Nor is the United States safer when resources that should be invested in policies targeting actual threats, such as drug cartels and human traffickers, are squandered on efforts to stymie legitimate asylum seekers.
Consistent with these principles, my Administration will implement a multi-pronged approach toward managing migration throughout North and Central America that reflects the Nation’s highest values.  We will work closely with civil society, international organizations, and the governments in the region to:  establish a comprehensive strategy for addressing the causes of migration in the region; build, strengthen, and expand Central and North American countries’ asylum systems and resettlement capacity; and increase opportunities for vulnerable populations to apply for protection closer to home.  At the same time, the United States will enhance lawful pathways for migration to this country and will restore and strengthen our own asylum system, which has been badly damaged by policies enacted over the last 4 years that contravened our values and caused needless human suffering.
Sec. 2.  United States Strategies for Addressing the Root Causes of Irregular Migration and for Collaboratively Managing Migration in the Region.  (a)  The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA), in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of any other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall as soon as possible prepare:
(i) the United States Strategy for Addressing the Root Causes of Migration (the “Root Causes Strategy”); and
(ii)  the United States Strategy for Collaboratively Managing Migration in the Region (the “Collaborative Management Strategy”).
(b)  The Root Causes Strategy shall identify and prioritize actions to address the underlying factors leading to migration in the region and ensure coherence of United States Government positions.  The Root Causes Strategy shall take into account, as appropriate, the views of bilateral, multilateral, and private sector partners, as well as civil society, and it shall include proposals to:
(i)    coordinate place-based efforts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras (the “Northern Triangle”) to address the root causes of migration, including by:   
(A)  combating corruption, strengthening democratic governance, and advancing the rule of law;
(B)  promoting respect for human rights, labor rights, and a free press;
(C)  countering and preventing violence, extortion, and other crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs, trafficking networks, and other organized criminal organizations;
(D)  combating sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence; and
(E)  addressing economic insecurity and inequality;
(ii)   consult and collaborate with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Labor to evaluate compliance with the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement to ensure that unfair labor practices do not disadvantage competition; and
(iii)  encourage the deployment of Northern Triangle domestic resources and the development of Northern Triangle domestic capacity to replicate and scale efforts to foster sustainable societies across the region.
(c)  The Collaborative Management Strategy shall identify and prioritize actions to strengthen cooperative efforts to address migration flows, including by expanding and improving upon previous efforts to resettle throughout the region those migrants who qualify for humanitarian protection.  The Collaborative Management Strategy should focus on programs and infrastructure that facilitate access to protection and other lawful immigration avenues, in both the United States and partner countries, as close to migrants’ homes as possible.  Priorities should include support for expanding pathways through which individuals facing difficult or dangerous conditions in their home countries can find stability and safety in receiving countries throughout the region, not only through asylum and refugee resettlement, but also through labor and other non-protection-related programs.  To support the development of the Collaborative Management Strategy, the United States Government shall promptly begin consultations with civil society, the private sector, international organizations, and governments in the region, including the Government of Mexico.  These consultations should address:
(i)    the continued development of asylum systems and resettlement capacities of receiving countries in the region, including through the provision of funding, training, and other support;
(ii)   the development of internal relocation and integration programs for internally displaced persons, as well as return and reintegration programs for returnees in relevant countries of the region; and
(iii)  humanitarian assistance, including through expansion of shelter networks, to address the immediate needs of individuals who have fled their homes to seek protection elsewhere in the region.
Sec. 3.  Expansion of Lawful Pathways for Protection and Opportunity in the United States.  (a)  The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review mechanisms for better identifying and processing individuals from the Northern Triangle who are eligible for refugee resettlement to the United States.  Consideration shall be given to increasing access and processing efficiency.  As part of this review, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall also identify and implement all legally available and appropriate forms of relief to complement the protection afforded through the United States Refugee Admissions Program.  The Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to the President with the results of the review.
(b)  As part of the review conducted pursuant to section 3(a) of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall:
(i)   consider taking all appropriate actions to reverse the 2017 decision rescinding the Central American Minors (CAM) parole policy and terminating the CAM Parole Program, see “Termination of the Central American Minors Parole Program,” 82 Fed. Reg. 38,926 (August 16, 2017), and consider initiating appropriate actions to reinstitute and improve upon the CAM Parole Program; and
(ii)  consider promoting family unity by exercising the Secretary’s discretionary parole authority to permit certain nationals of the Northern Triangle who are the beneficiaries of approved family-sponsored immigrant visa petitions to join their family members in the United States, on a case-by-case basis.
(c) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly evaluate and implement measures to enhance access for individuals from the Northern Triangle to visa programs, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.
Sec. 4.  Restoring and Enhancing Asylum Processing at the Border.  (a)  Resuming the Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Claims at United States Land Borders.
(i)   The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall promptly begin consultation and planning with international and non-governmental organizations to develop policies and procedures for the safe and orderly processing of asylum claims at United States land borders, consistent with public health and safety and capacity constraints.
(ii)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Director of CDC, shall promptly begin taking steps to reinstate the safe and orderly reception and processing of arriving asylum seekers, consistent with public health and safety and capacity constraints.  Additionally, in furtherance of this goal, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law:
(A)  The Secretary of HHS and the Director of CDC, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall promptly review and determine whether termination, rescission, or modification of the following actions is necessary and appropriate:  “Order Suspending the Right To Introduce Certain Persons From Countries Where a Quarantinable Communicable Disease Exists,” 85 Fed. Reg. 65,806 (October 13, 2020); and “Control of Communicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: Suspension of the Right to Introduce and Prohibition of Introduction of Persons into United States from Designated Foreign Countries or Places for Public Health Purposes,” 85 Fed. Reg. 56,424 (September 11, 2020) (codified at 42 C.F.R. 71.40).
(B)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review and determine whether to terminate or modify the program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), including by considering whether to rescind the Memorandum of the Secretary of Homeland Security titled “Policy Guidance for Implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols” (January 25, 2019), and any implementing guidance.  In coordination with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of CDC, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly consider a phased strategy for the safe and orderly entry into the United States, consistent with public health and safety and capacity constraints, of those individuals who have been subjected to MPP for further processing of their asylum claims.
(C)  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review and determine whether to rescind the interim final rule titled “Aliens Subject to a Bar on Entry Under Certain Presidential Proclamations; Procedures for Protection Claims,” 83 Fed. Reg. 55,934 (November 9, 2018), and the final rule titled “Asylum Eligibility and Procedural Modifications,” 85 Fed. Reg. 82,260 (December 17, 2020), as well as any agency memoranda or guidance that were issued in reliance on those rules.
(D)  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review and determine whether to rescind the interim final rule titled “Implementing Bilateral and Multilateral Asylum Cooperative Agreements Under the Immigration and Nationality Act,” 84 Fed. Reg. 63,994 (November 19, 2019), as well as any agency memoranda or guidance issued in reliance on that rule. In the interim, the Secretary of State shall promptly consider whether to notify the governments of the Northern Triangle that, as efforts to establish a cooperative, mutually respectful approach to managing migration across the region begin, the United States intends to suspend and terminate the following agreements:
(1)  “Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Guatemala on Cooperation Regarding the Examination of Protection Claims,” 84 Fed. Reg. 64,095 (July 26, 2019).
(2)  “Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of El Salvador for Cooperation in the Examination of Protection Claims,” 85 Fed. Reg. 83,597 (September 20, 2019).
(3)  “Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Honduras for Cooperation in the Examination of Protection Claims,” 85 Fed. Reg. 25,462 (September 25, 2019).
(E)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly cease implementing the “Prompt Asylum Case Review” program and the “Humanitarian Asylum Review Program” and consider rescinding any orders, rules, regulations, guidelines or policies implementing those programs.
(F)  The following Presidential documents are revoked:
(1)  Executive Order 13767 of January 25, 2017 (Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements).
(2)  Proclamation 9880 of May 8, 2019 (Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States).
(3)  Presidential Memorandum of April 29, 2019 (Additional Measures to Enhance Border Security and Restore Integrity to Our Immigration System).
(4)  Presidential Memorandum of April 6, 2018 (Ending “Catch and Release” at the Border of the United States and Directing Other Enhancements to Immigration Enforcement).
(5)  Presidential Memorandum of April 4, 2018 (Securing the Southern Border of the United States).
(G)  The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly take steps to rescind any agency memoranda or guidance issued in reliance on or in furtherance of any directive revoked by section 4(a)(ii)(F) of this order.
(b)  Ensuring a Timely and FairExpedited Removal Process.
(i)   The Secretary of Homeland Security, with support from the United States Digital Service within the Office of Management and Budget, shall promptly begin a review of procedures for individuals placed in expedited removal proceedings at the United States border.  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to the President with the results of this review and recommendations for creating a more efficient and orderly process that facilitates timely adjudications and adherence to standards of fairness and due process.
(ii)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review and consider whether to modify, revoke, or rescind the designation titled “Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal,” 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409 (July 23, 2019), regarding the geographic scope of expedited removal pursuant to INA section 235(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1), consistent with applicable law.  The review shall consider our legal and humanitarian obligations, constitutional principles of due process and other applicable law, enforcement resources, the public interest, and any other factors consistent with this order that the Secretary deems appropriate.  If the Secretary determines that modifying, revoking, or rescinding the designation is appropriate, the Secretary shall do so through publication in the Federal Register.   
(c)  Asylum Eligibility.  The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall:
(i)   within 180 days of the date of this order, conduct a comprehensive examination of current rules, regulations, precedential decisions, and internal guidelines governing the adjudication of asylum claims and determinations of refugee status to evaluate whether the United States provides protection for those fleeing domestic or gang violence in a manner consistent with international standards; and
(ii)  within 270 days of the date of this order, promulgate joint regulations, consistent with applicable law, addressing the circumstances in which a person should be considered a member of a “particular social group,” as that term is used in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(A), as derived from the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.
Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

                                JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

The Legacy of Racism within the U.S. Border Patrol

Since its creation in 1924, the U.S. Border Patrol has been steeped in institutional racism and has committed violent acts with near impunity. The racial animus of U.S. immigration policy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century formed the foundation for the agency. Federal laws banning Asian immigration were followed by the national origins quota system, which prioritized northern and western Europeans over the rest of the world. While not included in the original quotas, Mexicans, who previously could travel freely across the U.S.-Mexico border, began to experience increasing restrictions in the 1920s.
Congress created the Border Patrol in 1924 to patrol the northern and southern borders between ports of entry. Many officers came from organizations with a history of racial violence and brutality, including the Ku Klux Klan and the Texas Rangers, carrying over the culture of a racist “brotherhood” into the new agency.  In the Border Patrol’s early days, it focused on the unlawful entry of Asian and European immigrants. However, in the 1930s enforcement began to shift to Mexican citizens entering along the southern border.
A culture of racism within the Border Patrol has persisted throughout its history. Repeated reports have surfaced of agents using racial slurs, sexual comments, and other offensive language. Various lawsuits and studies have demonstrated the Border Patrol’s use of racial profiling in stops within the interior of the United States. Agents have maintained connections to the white supremacist movement and the paramilitary SWAT-style Border Patrol Tactical Unit has been deployed to crack down on protests of police brutality against Black people.
The Border Patrol began as a small agency, but its budget and deportations quickly skyrocketed. Over time, the agency targeted Mexican immigrants more aggressively, using a strategy of intensive enforcement directed at high-traffic areas. Beginning in the 1980s, the Border Patrol began a profound process of militarization and increased collaboration with other law enforcement agencies. The government began an official “prevention through deterrence” strategy in 1994, with the goal of making unlawful entry to the United States so dangerous as to discourage people from trying.  The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks led to the restructuring of immigration agencies, putting the Border Patrol under the newly created Department of Homeland Security, further increasing the growth and militarization of the agency.
The Border Patrol continues to perpetuate violence in the form of killing, sexual assault, excessive force, and verbal degradation—all with impunity. Despite these problems, the Border Patrol has lowered hiring standards to pursue rapid staff expansion. The Border Patrol often perpetrates violence through less direct means, including medical abuse and neglect, inhumane custody conditions, and family separation.
Since its founding nearly 100 years ago, the Border Patrol has become a sprawling and immensely powerful law enforcement agency with a deeply entrenched culture of racism and abuse. Nevertheless, the agency has received ample funding from Congress and enjoys an extraordinary degree of independence. Revamping the agency will involve fundamentally reshaping how Border Patrol agents view themselves in relation to the different communities and groups of people they encounter along the border.

Wittman's Weekly: Biden's Border Crisis
Washington, March 19, 2021
I am deeply concerned with what I am seeing at our southern border.  According to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), migrant encounters along the southern border were up 28% since January and are up 173% since last year. Not only adults but also children. CBP expects about 13,000 unaccompanied migrant children by May and 117,000 children by the end of the year. The number of unaccompanied children has grown so much that recent reporting states, ""shelters overseen by the U.S. government received more than 7,000 migrant children in February."" The number of unaccompanied children held in custody for more than three days is so great that they are ""overwhelming capacity at border facilities and indicating a crisis is taking shape."" It's official – this is a crisis.

The Biden Administration’s executive actions and policies have incentivized illegal behavior, don’t prioritize the needs of America’s economy or pandemic response, and have led to this crisis on the border.  The surge we are seeing is a direct result of open border policies, including President Biden’s executive orders weakening border security, virtually eliminating enforcement of immigration laws, putting a moratorium on deportations, and promising amnesty to all undocumented immigrants residing in the country illegally.  

What’s more, the Biden Administration has overturned policies that have proven successful, including the Migrant Protection Protocols, which required asylum seekers to wait for their hearings in border facilities in Central America, rather than being released inside the country. The Biden Administration also ended the asylum agreements President Trump negotiated with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, which required asylum seekers to remain in the first safe country they enter — the prevailing standard for asylum seekers in the European Union and in Canada.  

Instead, President Biden replaced these policies with the Obama-era process of ""catch and release,"" where illegal aliens claiming asylum are detained, processed and released inside the United States as they await their hearing — which usually takes years. Illegal immigration, mass amnesty, and porous borders are irreparably damaging to our legal immigration system. Clearly, our current immigration system is broken, and we need strong, serious changes to our current laws.  Congress must step in to address this crisis.   

We need an immigration system that works for the American people. First and foremost, we need to deter people from coming to our country illegally.  Secondly, we must enhance our border security. A physical barrier would deter those attempting to enter the country illegally, while also helping direct those seeking asylum to the proper points of entry. 

Furthermore, we must increase integrity in our asylum system. Thousands of inadmissible migrants arrive at our border every day and overwhelm our immigration system, many of whom are seeking asylum. Only a small minority of these individuals, however, are ultimately granted asylum and the large number of meritless asylum claims places an extraordinary strain on our immigration system and undermines many of the humanitarian purposes of asylum, making vulnerable people who actually qualify for asylum wait longer for that protection.  We must promote transparency and fairness in the asylum system by requiring the Department of Homeland Security to establish quality assurance procedures for credible fear of persecution interviews.

Lastly, we need to invest in our Border Patrol agents and law enforcement officers.  We have the laws on the books— we must ensure that our nation’s current immigration laws are enforced, immigration programs work properly, and that we provide the resources for law enforcement officials to get their jobs done. We must hire additional immigration judges and support staff, hire additional Border Patrol agents, and increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel.  

America was built by immigrants, and immigrants continue to play an undeniably important role in America today. But those seeking to enter the United States must do so legally. We are a nation of laws and we must continue to keep America safe. Our first responsibility is to protect the American people's safety and security, and I believe we will be able to do that by adequately addressing these critical provisions.

The Cost of Immigration Enforcement and Border Security

Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003, the federal government has spent an estimated $333 billion on the agencies that carry out immigration enforcement. As Congress renews its focus on immigration enforcement and border security under the Biden administration, it is important to review how much money has already been spent on these initiatives and what outcomes have been produced.
Immigration enforcement spending largely falls into two issue areas: border security and interior enforcement. Border spending includes staffing and resources needed for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of DHS working at and between United States ports of entry. Interior enforcement is primarily focused on staffing and resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), also part of DHS, to apprehend noncitizens in the interior of the country, detain those undergoing removal proceedings, and deport those ordered removed.
Currently, the number of border and interior enforcement officers stands at more than 50,000, with ICE and CBP employing over 84,000 people in total. The number of U.S. Border Patrol agents nearly doubled from Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 to FY 2019. Additionally, the number of ICE agents devoted to its office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) nearly tripled from FY 2003 to FY 2019. In FY 2019, DHS employed more than 8,200 ERO officers.
In February 2019, after the longest government shutdown in history, 35 days, Congress reached a deal with the President, offering $1.375 billion for 55 miles of fencing along the Rio Grande Valley. The President expressed his dissatisfaction with this offer, and shortly after signing the bill, declared a national emergency to fund his border wall through other means. In addition to the $1.375 billion that has already been allocated for fencing, he announced his intent to pull $600 million from the Treasury Department’s Drug Forfeiture Fund, $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense’s Drug Interdiction program, and 3.6 billion from the Department of Defense’s military construction account. An additional $1.5 billion in Department of Defense funds were transferred in May 2019.
What has this spending bought? The United States currently has roughly 700 miles of fencing along the Southern border, record levels of staff for ICE and CBP, as well as a fleet of drones¾among other resources. Some of these resources have been spent on ill-conceived projects, such as the $1 billion attempt to construct a “virtual fence” along the Southwest border, a project initiated in 2005 that was later scrapped for being ineffective and too costly. CBP announced a similar project in July 2020 to install a total of 200 “Autonomous Surveillance Towers” along remote areas of the southern border at a reported cost of several hundred million dollars.
Even with record level spending on enforcement, enforcement alone is not sufficient to address the challenges of undocumented migration. It also has significant unintended consequences; according to U.S. Border Patrol statistics, the Southwest border witnesses close to one death per day. All of these efforts that have accumulated in the name of security, however, do not necessarily measure border security properly, or make the border more secure. It is past time for the United States to turn away from costly and haphazard efforts to secure the border and instead focus on reining in the costs of border enforcement.
The Cost of Immigration Enforcement and Border Security in Dollars
The immigration enforcement budget has increased massively since the early 1990s, but many members of Congress and the president continue to call for more taxpayer dollars to be spent on immigration enforcement.
Since 1993, when the current strategy of concentrated border enforcement was first rolled out along the U.S.-Mexico border, the annual budget of the U.S. Border Patrol has increased more than ten-fold, from $363 million to nearly $4.9 billion (Figure 1).
Figure 1: U.S. Border Patrol Budget, FY 1990-2021
Sources: See endnote 14.
Since the creation of DHS in 2003, ICE spending has nearly tripled, from $3.3 billion to $8.3 billion today (Figure 2). Much of this funding has gone to increasing the agency’s ability to hold immigrants in detention in locations around the country.
Since 2003, the budget of CBP, which includes both the Border Patrol and operations at ports of entry, has also nearly tripled, rising from $5.9 billion in FY 2003 to a high of $17.7 billion in FY 2021 (Figure 2).

                                                              Figure 2: CBP & ICE Annual Budgets, FY 2003-2021
Source: Congressional budgets, gross budget authority as provided in Conference Reports, FY 2003-2021.
Increases in Immigration Enforcement and Border Security Personnel
Since 1993, the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents has skyrocketed from 4,139 agents to a congressionally authorized 23,645 agents in FY 2018, although due to hiring issues Border Patrol only had 19,648 agents in FY 2019. (Figure 3). Of those agents, 16,731 are deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, more than four times the 3,555 agents deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border in FY 1992. An additional 2,073 agents are deployed to the U.S.-Canada border, more than seven times the amount deployed in FY 1992.  A further 255 agents are deployed to the Coastal Border Sectors.
The number of CBP officers staffing ports of entry (POEs) grew from 17,279 in FY 2003 to 24,511 in FY 2019 (Figure 3).
The number of ICE agents devoted to Enforcement and Removal Operations increased from 2,710 in FY 2003 to 8,201 in FY 2019 (Figure 3). In total, ICE employs more than 20,000 people, including 6,500 special agents in ICE Homeland Security Investigations. Although Homeland Security Investigations does not have a primary role in enforcing immigration law, agents are frequently involved in the prosecution of individuals who have violated laws which provide a criminal penalty for immigration violations.

Previous Benchmarks Have Been Met, Yet Enforcement Funding Continues to Grow
The federal government has already met the border security benchmarks laid down in earlier Senate immigration reform bills.
As the American Immigration Lawyers Association pointed out in a January 2013 analysis, the “benchmarks” for border security specified in the bipartisan 2006, 2007, and 2010 immigration-reform legislative packages in the Senate have been largely met.
The requirements in those Senate bills for more border enforcement personnel, border fencing, surveillance technology, unmanned aerial vehicles, and detention beds have also been fulfilled and in many ways surpassed. ICE detention bed quotas rose from the normal 34,000 beds to 40,520 for 2018¾an all-time high. Despite Congress only appropriating enough money for 40,520 beds throughout the year, in FY 2019 ICE’s use of budgetary mechanisms to shift money from other locations to their detention account led to ICE breaking records by detaining more than 55,000 people.
Border security depends on the smart and efficient use of available resources. At the same, border enforcement cannot and should not be done in isolation. Instead, it must be examined in the larger context of reforms needed for the entire immigration system.

ALL ISSUES
President Trump kept his promise to build a wall on our southern border between the United States and Mexico. With 450 miles complete—and many more in progress—illegal crossings plummeted over 87 percent in areas where the wall went up.
By enforcing America’s immigration laws, President Trump made major gains toward ending the humanitarian crisis at our border; keeping criminals, terrorists, and drugs out of our country; and protecting American workers and taxpayers against job loss and misuse of the welfare system.

For instance, they field after-hours calls for the National Bulk Cash Smuggling Center, coordinate the rescue of human trafficking victims, post notices about reported narcotics smugglers and assist special agents during time-sensitive enforcement actions.
Background
The Tip Line was created to collect information that could aid ICE agents with investigations targeting sex offenders, especially child predators. Media coverage helped expand the Tip Line. When ICE launched the Tip Line, staff only received a few thousand calls per year. Today, the Tip Line averages more than 15,000 calls per month.

Rulings and Legal Decisions
U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issues binding advance rulings and other legal decisions in connection with the importation of merchandise into the United States. Advance rulings provide the international trade community with a transparent and efficient means of understanding how CBP will treat a prospective import or carrier transaction. 
For example, a ruling letter may address the tariff classification or appraised value of merchandise, the liquidation of an entry, or the exclusion of merchandise from entry. As such, ruling letters facilitate trade by enabling companies to make business decisions that are dependent on how their goods will be treated on importation. 
CBP also issues other binding decisions such as internal advice decisions letters (covering current import and carrier transactions), and protest review decisions (appeals of CBP decisions on completed transactions).
With a view to promoting transparency, CBP also makes available to the public various other guidance including the following: the Customs Rulings On-Line Search System (CROSS – a database of published rulings), the Customs Bulletin and Decisions, pertinent Federal Register Notices, CBP Directives and Handbooks, Informed Compliance Publications, and a summary of laws enforced by CBP.

The Customs Bulletin and Decisions is a weekly compilation of decisions, rulings, regulations, notices, and abstracts concerning customs and related matters of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Court of International Trade, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 
Additionally, an archive of trade-related Federal Register Notices provides the public with additional guidance concerning the importation of merchandise into the United States.
Informed Compliance Publications, Directives, and Handbooks
CBP has a number of Informed Compliance Publications (ICPs) in the ""What Every Member of the Trade Community Should Know About: ..."" series. As of the date of this posting, the subjects listed are available for reading or downloading. The first date shown is the original publication date. The subsequent dates, if any, show the revisions.

Medically-Trained Air and Marine Operations Agents Prove Critical to Law Enforcement Missions
Release Date Wed, 01/27/2021
WASHINGTON – U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Air and Marine Operations, Air and Marine Emergency Medical Service-qualified agents were crucial to AMO and interagency law enforcement teams throughout fiscal year 2020 by responding to 178 events and enabling dynamic medical support in high-risk scenarios.
A Yuma Air Branch Air and Marine Operations
paramedic renders medical aid to a man with
life-threatening injuries from a dirt bike
accident near the Andrade Port of Entry in
November 2020.
AMO employs agents trained as Emergency Medical Technicians and paramedics as aircrew members when conducting rescue operations. AMO established its AMEMS program to insert agents with specialized medical capabilities in austere airborne and maritime environments. Each AMEMS-qualified agent is a nationally certified EMT and undergoes rigorous annual training to maintain skill proficiencies in all environments and conditions.
Graduates of the AMEMS program are critical additions to law enforcement teams responding to border security, contingency, and national security missions. During FY 2020, AMEMS-certified agents contributed unique medical expertise during six hurricanes, as well as during National Special Security Events (NSSE), and civil unrest responses throughout the nation.
“We are not an air ambulance service; law enforcement is our primary mission. But it’s this unique ability our agents have that allows them to transition immediately to a NSSE, natural disaster or a humanitarian crisis life-saving role,” said Supervisory Marine Interdiction Agent (SMIA) Mike Naujoks, AMEMS Program Manager within AMO’s Training, Safety, & Standards Directorate.
Air and Marine Operations paramedics and
U.S. Border Patrols' Border Search, Rescue,
and Trauma (BORSTAR) agents are often the
first emergency medical technicians to render
care to those they encounter on the job.
On July 7, a McAllen Air and Marine Branch aircrew responded to a search along the Rio Grande River for a woman with a fractured ankle who was left by a crossing group. An AMEMS paramedic treated her before EMS transported her to the hospital.
In mid-December, a Deming, N.M.-based AS350 crew responded to a United States Border Patrol request for aerial coverage, where an armed person suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound. An AMEMS EMT and a USBP agent attempted life-saving care before the aircrew delivered the injured man to a local hospital.
“The AMEMS program would also like to eventually expand this skillset to be able to treat our law enforcement K9 counterparts in the future,” Naujoks said.  In December, a Tucson-based AS350 crew rescued a distressed large animal when the pilot landed to render aid. The air interdiction agent was the only AMEMS-qualified agent in AMO who held qualifications to also work with animals.

Air and Marine Agents Rescue Man With Quadriplegia and Family Stranded in Their Home
Air and Marine Operations safeguards our nation by anticipating and confronting security threats through our aviation and maritime law enforcement expertise, innovative capabilities, and partnerships at the border and beyond. With approximately 1,800 federal agents and mission support personnel, 240 aircraft and 300 marine vessels operating throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, AMO serves as the nation’s experts in airborne and maritime law enforcement.
In fiscal year 2020, AMO enforcement actions resulted in the seizure or disruption of 194,220 pounds of cocaine, 278,492 pounds of marijuana, 15,985 pounds of methamphetamine, 952 weapons and $51.5 million, 1,066 arrests, 47,872 apprehensions of illegal aliens.
  U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between official ports of entry. CBP is charged with securing the borders of the United States while enforcing hundreds of laws and facilitating lawful trade and travel.

Fact Sheet: President Biden Sends Immigration Bill to Congress as Part of His Commitment to Modernize our Immigration System
HOME
BRIEFING ROOM
STATEMENTS AND RELEASES
The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 establishes a new system to responsibly manage and secure our border, keep our families and communities safe, and better manage migration across the Hemisphere
President Biden is sending a bill to Congress on day one to restore humanity and American values to our immigration system. The bill provides hardworking people who enrich our communities every day and who have lived here for years, in some cases for decades, an opportunity to earn citizenship. The legislation modernizes our immigration system, and prioritizes keeping families together, growing our economy, responsibly managing the border with smart investments, addressing the root causes of migration from Central America, and ensuring that the United States remains a refuge for those fleeing persecution. The bill will stimulate our economy while ensuring that every worker is protected. The bill creates an earned path to citizenship for our immigrant neighbors, colleagues, parishioners, community leaders, friends, and loved ones—including Dreamers and the essential workers who have risked their lives to serve and protect American communities.
The U.S. Citizenship Act will:
PROVIDE PATHWAYS TO CITIZENSHIP & STRENGTHEN LABOR PROTECTIONS
Create an earned roadmap to citizenship for undocumented individuals. The bill allows undocumented individuals to apply for temporary legal status, with the ability to apply for green cards after five years if they pass criminal and national security background checks and pay their taxes. Dreamers, TPS holders, and immigrant farmworkers who meet specific requirements are eligible for green cards immediately under the legislation. After three years, all green card holders who pass additional background checks and demonstrate knowledge of English and U.S. civics can apply to become citizens. Applicants must be physically present in the United States on or before January 1, 2021. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may waive the presence requirement for those deported on or after January 20, 2017 who were physically present for at least three years prior to removal for family unity and other humanitarian purposes. Lastly, the bill further recognizes America as a nation of immigrants by changing the word “alien” to “noncitizen” in our immigration laws.
Keep families together. The bill reforms the family-based immigration system by clearing backlogs, recapturing unused visas, eliminating lengthy wait times, and increasing per-country visa caps.  It also eliminates the so-called “3 and 10-year bars,” and other provisions that keep families apart. The bill further supports familes by more explicitly including permanent partnerships and eliminating discrimination facing LGBTQ+ families. It also provides protections for orphans, widows, children, and Filipino veterans who fought alongside the United States in World War II. Lastly, the bill allows immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join family in the United States on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.
Embrace diversity.  The bill includes the NO BAN Act that prohibits discrimination based on religion and limits presidential authority to issue future bans. The bill also increases Diversity Visas to 80,000 from 55,000.
Promote immigrant and refugee integration and citizenship. The bill provides new funding to state and local governments, private organizations, educational institutions, community-based organizations, and not-for-profit organizations to expand programs to promote integration and inclusion, increase English-language instruction, and provide assistance to individuals seeking to become citizens.
Grow our economy. This bill clears employment-based visa backlogs, recaptures unused visas, reduces lengthy wait times, and eliminates per-country visa caps. The bill makes it easier for graduates of U.S. universities with advanced STEM degrees to stay in the United States; improves access to green cards for workers in lower-wage sectors; and eliminates other unnecessary hurdles for employment-based green cards. The bill provides dependents of H-1B visa holders work authorization, and children are prevented from “aging out” of the system. The bill also creates a pilot program to stimulate regional economic development, gives DHS the authority to adjust green cards based on macroeconomic conditions, and incentivizes higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to prevent unfair competition with American workers.
Protect workers from exploitation and improve the employment verification process. The bill requires that DHS and the Department of Labor establish a commission involving labor, employer, and civil rights organizations to make recommendations for improving the employment verification process. Workers who suffer serious labor violations and cooperate with worker protection agencies will be granted greater access to U visa relief. The bill protects workers who are victims of workplace retaliation from deportation in order to allow labor agencies to interview these workers. It also protects migrant and seasonal workers, and increases penalties for employers who violate labor laws.
PRIORITIZE SMART BORDER CONTROLS
Supplement existing border resources with technology and infrastructure. The legislation builds on record budget allocations for immigration enforcement by authorizing additional funding for the Secretary of DHS to develop and implement a plan to deploy technology to expedite screening and enhance the ability to identify narcotics and other contraband at every land, air, and sea port of entry.  This includes high-throughput scanning technologies to ensure that all commercial and passenger vehicles and freight rail traffic entering the United States at land ports of entry and rail-border crossings along the border undergo pre-primary scanning. It also authorizes and provides funding for plans to improve infrastructure at ports of entry to enhance the ability to process asylum seekers and detect, interdict, disrupt and prevent narcotics from entering the United States. It authorizes the DHS Secretary to develop and implement a strategy to manage and secure the southern border between ports of entry that focuses on flexible solutions and technologies that expand the ability to detect illicit activity, evaluate the effectiveness of border security operations, and be easily relocated and broken out by Border Patrol Sector. To protect privacy, the DHS Inspector General is authorized to conduct oversight to ensure that employed technology effectively serves legitimate agency purposes.
Manage the border and protect border communities.  The bill provides funding for training and continuing education to promote agent and officer safety and professionalism. It also creates a Border Community Stakeholder Advisory Committee, provides more special agents at the DHS Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate criminal and administrative misconduct, and requires the issuance of department-wide policies governing the use of force. The bill directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the impact of DHS’s authority to waive environmental and state and federal laws to expedite the construction of barriers and roads near U.S. borders and provides for additional rescue beacons to prevent needless deaths along the border. The bill authorizes and provides funding for DHS, in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and nongovernmental experts, to develop guidelines and protocols for standards of care for individuals, families, and children in CBP custody.
Crack down on criminal organizations. The bill enhances the ability to prosecute individuals involved in smuggling and trafficking networks who are responsible for the exploitation of migrants. It also expands investigations, intelligence collection and analysis pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act to increase sanctions against foreign narcotics traffickers, their organizations and networks. The bill also requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and DHS, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to improve and expand transnational anti-gang task forces in Central America.
ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION
Start from the source. The bill codifies and funds the President’s $4 billion four-year inter-agency plan to address the underlying causes of migration in the region, including by increasing assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, conditioned on their ability to reduce the endemic corruption, violence, and poverty that causes people to flee their home countries. It also creates safe and legal channels for people to seek protection, including by establishing Designated Processing Centers throughout Central America to register and process displaced persons for refugee resettlement and other lawful migration avenues—either to the United States or other partner countries. The bill also re-institutes the Central American Minors program to reunite children with U.S. relatives and creates a Central American Family Reunification Parole Program to more quickly unite families with approved family sponsorship petitions.
Improve the immigration courts and protect vulnerable individuals. The bill expands family case management programs, reduces immigration court backlogs, expands training for immigration judges, and improves technology for immigration courts. The bill also restores fairness and balance to our immigration system by providing judges and adjudicators with discretion to review cases and grant relief to deserving individuals. Funding is authorized for legal orientation programs and counsel for children, vulnerable individuals, and others when necessary to ensure the fair and efficient resolution of their claims. The bill also provides funding for school districts educating unaccompanied children, while clarifying sponsor responsibilities for such children.
Support asylum seekers and other vulnerable populations. The bill eliminates the one-year deadline for filing asylum claims and provides funding to reduce asylum application backlogs. It also increases protections for U visa, T visa, and VAWA applicants, including by raising the cap on U visas from 10,000 to 30,000. The bill also expands protections for foreign nationals assisting U.S. troops.

Immigration Enforcement Actions Annual Flow Report
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engages in immigration enforcement actions to prevent unlawful entry into the United States and to apprehend and repatriate noncitizens who have violated or failed to comply with U.S. immigration laws. Primary responsibility for the enforcement of immigration law within DHS rests with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). CBP enforces immigration laws at and between the ports of entry, ICE is responsible for interior enforcement and for detention and removal operations, and USCIS adjudicates applications and petitions for immigration and naturalization benefits.
Each Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS) Immigration Enforcement Actions Annual Flow Report contains information obtained from CBP and ICE case records and processed by OHSS to describe the number and characteristics of foreign nationals found inadmissible, apprehended, arrested, detained, returned, or removed during a given fiscal year. Below are the annual flow reports on enforcement actions.

120,Border Enforcement Developments Since 1993 and How to Change ...,https://cmsny.org/publications/border-enforcement-developments-since-1993-and-how-to-change-cbp/,20208-20208,"Border Enforcement Developments Since 1993 and How to Change CBP
Daniel E. Martínez, Josiah Heyman, and Jeremy Slack
August 24, 2020
Executive Summary
Enforcement along the US-Mexico border has intensified significantly since the early 1990s. Social scientists have documented several consequences of border militarization, including increased border-crosser deaths, the killing of more than 110 people by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents over the past decade, and expanded ethno-racial profiling in southwestern communities by immigration authorities. Less attention has been paid to the pervasive and routine mistreatment migrants experience on a daily basis in CBP custody.
This paper traces major developments in border enforcement to three notable initiatives: the “prevention-through-deterrence” strategy; the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Consequence Delivery System, initiated in 2011. Despite the massive buildup in enforcement, CBP has operated with little transparency and accountability to the detriment of migrants. The paper provides an overview of the findings of nongovernmental organizations and social scientists regarding migrant mistreatment while in CBP custody. It then highlights important shifts in migration patterns over the past decade, as well as changes in border enforcement efforts during the Trump administration. It discusses how these transformations affect migrants’ everyday encounters with CBP officials.
The paper concludes by providing specific recommendations for improving CBP conduct. Its core theme is the need to emphasize and inculcate lessons of appropriate police behavior, civil rights, and civil liberties in training and recruiting agents and in setting responsibilities of supervisors and administrators. It offers recommendations regarding important but underrecognized issues, including ending the use of CBP agents/officers as Asylum Officers, as well as better-known issues such as militarization and the border wall.
Background
Enforcement of the US-Mexico border has increased substantially over the past three decades. Segments of steel wall, vehicle barriers, and razor wire now span miles along the border. Floodlights, motion sensors, and cameras are omnipresent in border communities, as are uniformed agents, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles and helicopters, and Border Patrol checkpoints.
The border has not always been this heavily militarized (Dunn 1996; 2010). As illustrated in Figure 1, the US Border Patrol had 4,139 agents in 1992, the overwhelming majority of them stationed in southwestern sectors. Nearly two decades later, this number has swelled more than five-fold, peaking at 21,444 in 2011 before leveling off to 19,648 by 2019 (CBP 2020a).
The Border Patrol’s budget has increased even more dramatically. In 1992, the federal government allocated $326 million to the agency. By 2019, its budget had ballooned to nearly $4.7 billion, increasing year-over-year since the beginning of the Trump administration (American Immigration Council 2019). Despite these substantial increases in staffing and expenditures, the Border Patrol and CBP more broadly have operated behind a veil of secrecy and with limited accountability and oversight (Martínez, Cantor, and Ewing 2014; Heyman 2017; Cantor and Ewing 2017; Nowrasteh 2017; Slack, Martinez, and Whiteford 2018). This is particularly troubling because CBP, the Border Patrol’s parent organization, is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the world (CBP 2020b). Moreover, roughly 15 million people in the United States live within 100 kilometers of the US-Mexico border, many of whom are of Mexican origin. Approximately 200 million US residents live within the 100-mile “reasonable distance” border zone in which CBP is authorized to operate, as defined in Title 8 § 287.1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (ACLU 2020).

A key starting point for current border enforcement strategies was the El Paso Sector’s Operation Hold the Line in late 1993 (Dunn 1996; 2010). Building on this experiment, the Border Patrol announced the adoption of the “prevention-through-deterrence” strategy in 1994 and formally launched the initiative the following year. The prevention-through-deterrence strategy, which stemmed from a recommendation set forth by Sandia National Laboratories, aimed to heavily enforce and patrol regularly frequented urban crossing points along the US-Mexico border to deter would-be undocumented migrants from attempting to cross (Cornelius 2001; Andreas 2009). Over the next several years, the Border Patrol received increases in funding, personnel, and equipment to enforce crossing points in San Diego-Tijuana (1994 Operation Gatekeeper), Nogales-Nogales (1995 Operation Safeguard), and Brownsville-Matamoros (1997 Operation Rio Grande). Early studies demonstrated that the prevention-through-deterrence strategy did little to deter unauthorized migrants (Dávila, Pagán, and Soydemir 2002), but rather redistributed migration flows into remote and less frequently patrolled areas of southern Arizona and South Texas (Rubio-Goldsmith, McCormick, Martínez, and Duarte 2006; Soto and Martínez 2018).
Border enforcement continued to expand in the wake of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, despite no evidence that potential terrorists were entering into the United States through the US-Mexico border. The prevailing political discourse at the time equated border enforcement with national security, and likened increased securitization with the prevention of subsequent acts of terrorism. Due to this discourse and mounting political pressure, Congress adopted legislation that eliminated the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 2003 and transferred the Border Patrol to the newly created US Customs and Border Protection within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (Heyman and Ackleson 2009).
In 2011, DHS launched an initiative dubbed the “consequence delivery system” (CDS), which corresponded with additional increases in the Border Patrol’s budget in subsequent years. The aim of CDS was to alleviate what the agency perceived as the shortcomings of the prevention-through-deterrence strategy. The CDS assigns escalating punishments tailored to categories of individual unauthorized border-crossers with the end goal of reducing recidivism or repeat migration attempts (Slack, Martínez, Whiteford, and Peiffer 2015; Slack, Martínez, and Whiteford 2018; Martínez, Slack, and Martínez-Schuldt 2019). Specific programs associated with the CDS include increased criminal prosecutions and imprisonment for unlawful entry and re-entry through Operation Streamline, fast-track proceedings, and lateral repatriations through the Alien Transfer and Exit Program (ATEP). Despite these policy changes, such programs have a relatively weak long-term deterrent effect when placed against the powerful pull of “place,” especially among migrants who have established homes in the United States (Martínez, Slack, and Martínez-Schuldt 2019).
Social scientists have documented the consequences of increased border enforcement over the past three decades. Perhaps most notable have been the thousands of undocumented border-crosser deaths since the mid-1990s (Eschbach, Hagan, Rodriguez, Hernandez-León and Bailey 1999; Cornelius 2001; Rubio-Goldsmith et al. 2006; Martinez, Reineke, Rubio-Goldsmith, and Parks 2014; Soto and Martínez 2018), the killing of at least 110 people by CBP agents between 2010 and 2020 (SBCC 2020), and expanded ethno-racial profiling in southwestern communities by immigration authorities (Goldsmith, Romero, Rubio-Goldsmith, Escobedo, and Khoury 2009). Less attention has been paid to the pervasive and routine mistreatment immigrants experience in US custody. The abuse of immigrants by CBP agents is particularly concerning both because the agency encounters hundreds of thousands of people annually and because of a lack of oversight and accountability of CPB (Heyman 2017)—despite being funded by US taxpayers to the tune of $18.2 billion by fiscal year (FY) 2020 (White House 2020).
Mistreatment of Migrants while in US Custody: The Pre-Trump Status Quo
The routine mistreatment and abuse of migrants in US custody is not new. It predates the Trump administration by several decades (Heyman 1995; Dunn 1996). Nevertheless, the effort to document this mistreatment is a much more recent development. This information comes from three main sources: abuse documentation efforts by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), empirical studies conducted by social scientists, and formal complaints lodged against CBP.
Documentation by Nongovernmental Organizations
Over the past decade, NGOs along the US-Mexico border have made a concerted effort to document the various forms of abuse and mistreatment experienced by immigrants in US custody. In 2008, the humanitarian organization No More Deaths released a report that documented over 400 distinct accounts of abuse—which often involved multiple victims—in short-term Border Patrol custody along the Arizona-Sonora border. The report did not seek to establish the prevalence of mistreatment, but No More Deaths published an additional report in 2011 that aimed to do just that. Between the fall of 2008 and spring of 2011, No More Deaths conducted 4,130 interviews with 12,895 individuals in Naco, Nogales, and Agua Prieta, Sonora about their experiences with Border Patrol agents. It found that about 10 percent of interviewees experienced physical abuse (e.g., excessive use of force; strikes with hand, feet, and objects), while 13 percent reported verbal abuse (e.g., racial, ethnic, and sexual epithets; profanity; yelling and screaming).
The Kino Border Initiative (KBI) published a similar report in 2013 based on surveys conducted with 4,963 Mexican and Central American migrants to whom KBI provided meals at a day shelter in Nogales, Sonora. All surveys were conducted between March and August 2012. Among the 3,209 respondents who had experienced encounters with Border Patrol agents, nearly 25 percent reported being abused in some way, including 6 percent who reported experiencing physical abuse and 13 percent verbal abuse. Finally, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom has documented how CBP officers avoid or bypass asylum processes mandated by law for persons subject to expedited removal who express a fear of return (USCIRF 2016).
Systematic Surveys by Social Scientists
Research by social scientists largely corroborates the findings from NGO abuse documentation efforts. Drawing on a random sample of 211 adult Salvadoran deportees in 1999 and 2000, Phillips, Rodriguez, and Hagan (2002) found that 16 percent reported being physically abused (i.e., more physical coercion than handcuffs) when apprehended by US authorities. In a separate study conducted several years later, consisting of 300 adult Salvadoran deportees, the authors found that 16 percent experienced excessive (non-justifiable) use of force when apprehended and 11 percent while detained. Twenty-five percent experienced racial slurs when apprehended, and 26 percent while in detention (Phillips, Hagan, and Rodriguez 2006).
Data collected through the first two iterations of the Migrant Border Crossing Study (MBCS) offer further insight on the mistreatment migrants experience by CBP agents. Between 2007 and 2009, Martínez and colleagues conducted 415 surveys with a random sample of recently repatriated adult Mexican migrants in a migrant shelter in Nogales, Sonora (Martinez et al. 2017). Eleven percent of respondents reported being physically abused (e.g., being punched, slapped, kicked, or thrown to the ground) and 34 percent verbally abused (e.g., racist, sexist, homophobic slurs; yelling; or cursing) by US officials when apprehended during their most recent unauthorized border-crossing attempt. In 2009, Slack, Martínez, and Whiteford replicated and expanded upon the first wave of the MBCS. Between 2009 and 2012, the research team, led by Jeremy Slack, completed surveys with a random sample of 1,109 recently deported Mexican migrants in Tijuana and Mexicali, Baja California; Nogales, Sonora; Juarez, Chihuahua, Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, and Mexico DF. Drawing on the same mistreatment questions used in the first MBCS, Slack and colleagues found that 12 percent and 20 percent of respondents experienced physical abuse and verbal abuse, respectively, while in US custody (Martínez, Slack, and Heyman 2013; Slack, Martínez, and Whiteford 2018).
Most academic studies examining migrant mistreatment have focused on adult populations. In an attempt to overcome this limitation, Coulter and colleagues (2020) completed 97 surveys with recently repatriated unaccompanied Mexican minors in Nogales, Sonora and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The researchers found that CBP’s treatment of “unaccompanied alien children” (UAC) did not conform with standards set forth in the Flores settlement, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), or CBP’s own procedures and directives. Instead, border officials did not consistently screen unaccompanied minors for fear of returning to their country of origin or fully inform them about the removal process. Indeed, over half of respondents did not know what forms they signed in CBP custody, and 14 percent stated they felt that CBP agents forced or pressured them to sign the forms. These children were also often held in poor conditions. Moreover, the study noted that UAC experience abusive situations in CBP custody beyond the agency’s failure to conform with official policies, protocols, or procedures. Nearly 15 percent of respondents experienced verbal abuse, seven percent physical abuse, and seven percent were threatened with a weapon by CBP agents.
Another academic source of data on migrant mistreatment has been El Colegio de la Frontera Norte’s Encuesta sobre Migración en la Frontera Norte de México (EMIF-Norte) survey. Since 2005, EMIF-Norte has gathered data on Mexican deportees’ physical and verbal abuse during their most recent Border Patrol apprehension. Figure 2 provides the unweighted physical and verbal abuse rates documented in each iteration of the EMIF-Norte survey through 2019. Overall, reported physical and verbal abuse rates tend to be lower among EMIF-Norte respondents when compared to the other data sources previously described. Several factors might account for these discrepancies, including selection bias, social desirability bias, and variation in interview contexts. For instance, EMIF-Norte surveys are typically administered in Mexican governmental offices, while most other academic studies have drawn on samples of deportees in migrant shelters, outside of official ports of entry, or in other nongovernmental spaces. Moreover, it is difficult to determine from the EMIF-Norte data when a respondent’s most recent apprehension took place, which could lead to retrospective bias if this event had occurred several months or years prior to being surveyed.
Figure 2. EMIF-Norte Abuse Rates and Southwestern Apprehension Statistics, FY 2005-2019
Sources: Encuesta sobre Migración en la Frontera Norte de México (2005-2019; N = 83,929) and US Customs and Border Protection 2020c.
Methodological caveats aside, the EMIF-Norte data, which consists of repeated cross-sectional surveys, offer insight about changing trends in the treatment of Mexican migrants during apprehension. In addition to providing physical and verbal abuse rates captured in the EMIF-Norte survey, Figure 2 illustrates aggregate southwestern Border Patrol apprehensions of Mexican and non-Mexican border-crossers between 2005 and 2019. (EMIF-Norte only surveys Mexican deportees and therefore cannot speak to the mistreatment non-Mexicans experience, an increasingly large portion of those apprehended by the Border Patrol. Nevertheless, we included apprehensions of non-Mexicans in Figure 2 to provide additional context regarding the changing nature of migration patterns, which is pertinent to our subsequent discussion in the second half of the paper.)
Overall, Figure 2 demonstrates that the general downward trends in physical and abuse rates appear to be associated with changes in migration patterns. First, the decreases in abuse rates have coincided with an overall decrease in border crossings, which immigration scholars often measure by using southwestern apprehensions. This suggests that volume matters. The tension between Border Patrol agents and border-crossers may be higher when more people are crossing the border and being apprehended. In a similar vein, abuse rates, especially verbal abuse rates, decreased as the proportion of Mexican apprehensions decreased. This suggests that context matters. It is possible that the general comportment of Border Patrol agents toward Mexican border-crossers has changed as they have apprehended a higher proportion of non-Mexicans, especially Central American asylum seekers, a higher proportion of whom are women and children. Again, this data does not speak to whether Border Patrol’s treatment of non-Mexicans is better when compared to their treatment of Mexicans. Rather, we simply offer this shifting context as a possible explanation for decreasing abuse rates over time reported by EMIF-Norte respondents.
Perhaps more important, figure 2 also unmistakably illustrates that rates of physical and verbal abuse reported by Mexican deportees began to decrease well before Trump assumed office. The enormous post-1993 Border Patrol hiring surge ended by September 2010 (CBP 2020a), so over time there were fewer inexperienced officers. In addition, Gil Kerlikowske served as commissioner of CBP from March 2014 to January 2017 and implemented some important reforms in conduct standards, including those initiated by DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson. Finally, despite decreases in abuse rates, EMIF-Norte data also demonstrate that the physical and verbal mistreatment of apprehended Mexican border-crossers persists, suggesting there is a need for additional reforms.
Formal Complaints against Customs and Border Protection
Abuse documentation efforts by NGOs suggest that the mistreatment of migrants in US custody is not a rare occurrence. This assertion is supported by several peer-reviewed academic studies that yield consistent results despite drawing on different samples. Nevertheless, abuse documentation and self-report studies shed little light on the extent to which the perpetrators of these abuses are held accountable for their actions. Other researchers have helped overcome this limitation by examining the nature and disciplinary outcomes of formal complaints lodged against CBP officials by people held in their custody.
Through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from CBP’s Office of Internal Affairs (OIA), now renamed the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), the American Immigration Council (AIC) secured data on 809 formal complaints of alleged abuse filed against Border Patrol agents between January 2009 and January 2012 (Martínez, Cantor, and Ewing 2014). AIC found that 40 percent of all cases cited “physical abuse” as the reason for the complaint, followed by “excessive use of force” (38 percent), “unspecified abuse” (13 percent), and “Other” (3 percent). These data also demonstrated persistent inaction by CBP’s OIA. Fifty-eight percent of formal complaints resulted in “no action taken” against the officer who perpetrated the abuse, while 40 percent were still pending investigation when AIC received their data request (Martínez, Cantor, and Ewing 2014). Only 13 formal complaints resulted in some form of disciplinary action. In other words, among cases in which a decision was made, over 97 percent resulted in “no action taken,” with an average of 122 days taken to arrive at the decision. Although AIC was not able to assess independently the merit of each complaint, the notable absence of disciplinary action is concerning, especially considering that 78 percent of complaints alleged physical abuse or excessive use of force.
Findings from the 2014 AIC report received the attention of Jeh Johnson who, at the time, served as the Secretary of the DHS. In September of 2014, Johnson announced several changes aimed to increase transparency and streamline the investigation of complaints filed against CBP officials. For instance, the newly instituted policies allowed qualified CBP OIA employees to “serve as criminal rather than general investigators,” which gave the agency the authority “to investigate or act upon claims of abuse within the organization” (Cantor and Ewing 2017, 4). CBP also implemented a standardized review process for use-of-force incidents to expedite the investigation process and “adopted a new ‘Integrity and Personnel Accountability Strategy’ for all employees to foster a culture of integrity and eradicate corruption within the agency” (ibid.).
In 2017, AIC published a follow-up report using a similar methodology to examine an additional 2,178 cases of alleged misconduct by Border Patrol agents filed between January 2012 and October 2015. Although AIC was unable to assess the effect of the policy changes set forth by Secretary Johnson in late 2014, nor the impacts of changes stemming from recommendations made in a 2015 Pivotal Practices Consulting report commissioned by CBP, the findings of the 2017 report were strikingly similar to those of the AIC report published three years earlier. The complaints ranged from physical, sexual, and verbal abuse, to general misconduct and conflicts of interest, with over 59 percent of allegations citing “physical abuse.” As Cantor and Ewing note, “even though assessing which cases did or did not merit disciplinary action was not feasible with the information CBP provided, the overall findings of this report are still remarkable” (ibid., 1). Among all complaints filed, 55 percent resulted in “no action,” while 42 percent were “pending investigation” when AIC received the data. Only 52 complaints resulted in formal action, including counseling (25 cases), suspension (11 cases), reprimand (11 cases), alternative remedy (2 cases), other (2 cases), and resignation (1). In other words, “no action” was taken against the accused officer in nearly 96 percent of cases in which an outcome was determined. Systematic data since 2015 have not been published.
Other indicators suggest pervasive problems within CBP’s Border Patrol. For instance, a 2017 report by the Cato Institute, drawing on data from the Office of Personnel Management, found that “Border Patrol agents are more likely to be terminated for discipline or performance reasons than officers in other large federal law enforcement agencies (those with 5,000 or more officers)” (Nowrasteh 2017, 1). Nevertheless, as Nowrasteh notes, “A high relative termination rate could be a sign of effective internal affairs but not in the case of Border Patrol, which is inadequately overseen” (2017, 10).
The triangulation of NGO abuse documentation efforts, peer-reviewed studies and data sources, and complaints lodged against CBP suggests that the routine mistreatment of migrants while in US custody: (1) preceded the Trump administration; (2) is widespread and often consists of serious allegations of physical and sexual abuse; and (3) seldom results in sanctions against abusers.
To the best of our knowledge, there have not yet been any systematic empirical, peer-reviewed studies that have examined the treatment of migrants in CBP custody during Trump’s tenure, although extensive journalistic reporting is available. One data source—the EMIF-Norte—suggests that physical and verbal abuse rates during apprehension among Mexican deportees may be declining. However, these declines predate the Trump administration and are likely a function of shifting institutional contexts due to changes in staffing and migration patterns as well as late Obama period reforms. Additional systematic research is required to assess whether the trends identified in the EMIF-Norte data are generalizable. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that mistreatment of migrants while in custody persists. Moreover, as the American Immigration Council and Cato Institute have each pointed out, an absence of organizational oversight as well as a lack of accountability of CBP agents engaging in the abuse of migrants continue to be concerns.
Changes in Border Enforcement and Migration Patterns During the Trump Administration
Within the first few weeks of his administration, Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order (EO) 13767, titled “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements.” The executive order carried notable implications for enforcement along the US-Mexico border. It expanded the use of expedited removals in the border region, authorized an increase in Border Patrol staffing by 5,000 agents, mandated the detention of immigrants apprehended for unlawful entry, and prioritized criminal prosecutions for immigration offenses committed at the border (US Department of Homeland Security, 2017b). EO 13767 also effectively served as the precursor to the controversial Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) or “Remain in Mexico” policy. Specifically, it allows DHS to return apprehended immigrants “to the foreign contiguous territory from which they arrived, pending the outcome of removal proceedings” if the person does not “pose a risk of a subsequent illegal entry” (US Department of Homeland Security, 2017).
EO 13767 also called on DHS to “identify and allocate all sources of available funding for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of a wall” (US Department of Homeland Security 2017). Among the changes in border enforcement during the Trump administration, the construction of a new border wall and large-scale family separations at the border have garnered the most public attention. Native American nations, NGOs, elected officials in border communities, activists, legal scholars, academics, and environmental justice groups have been outspoken in their opposition to the expansion and construction of the wall. Other policy changes, including MPP and “metering,” which limits the number of asylum seekers CBP agents will interview in a given day at ports of entry, have also had devastating impacts on immigrants, particularly asylum seekers and other vulnerable populations.
Despite Trump’s obsession with the border wall, increases in the volume of border crossings, changes in the demographic profile of border-crossers, and shifts in people’s modes of crossing appear to have had the most influence on border enforcement during the first three-and-a-half years of his presidency. As illustrated in Figure 3, though border crossings along the US-Mexico border—measured as southwestern Border Patrol apprehensions—dipped significantly the first year Trump was in office, they then increased from 303,916 in 2017 to 396,579 in 2018, before more than doubling to 851,508 in 2019 (CBP 2020d). The notable increase in apprehensions, combined with the 126,001 people deemed “inadmissible” at southwestern ports of entry, made 2019 the busiest year for attempted border-crossings in over a decade (CBP 2020e). In the wake of this increased volume, the Trump administration made it more difficult to process and detain families, administer credible fear interviews, and respect the legal requirements of asylum. This includes a lack of access to legal counsel, especially in the Prompt Asylum Claim Review (PACR) and Humanitarian Asylum Review Process (HARP) programs, as well as attempts to change the status of individuals entering the country to limit access to bond. Under MPP, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has argued that individuals enrolled in this program are not eligible for bond even if they originally entered the country between ports of entry (Entry Without Inspection [EWI]), and is classifying everyone as an “Arriving Alien” (AA), meaning that ICE is in charge of granting parole. This has resulted in extended periods in detention with often horrific conditions (Costello 2019). Additionally, there have been record high numbers of unaccompanied minors stuck in privately operated shelters because of new requirements for sponsors that made people afraid to come forward or unable to place children in their final destination (usually with immediate family members in the United States) (Long 2018).
Figure 3. Southwestern Border Patrol Apprehensions, FY 2007-2019

Unlike earlier periods of unauthorized migration along the US-Mexico border, which consisted largely of single Mexican male migrants (see FY 2007 in Figure 2), Central American families have made up the bulk of the population crossing the border and being apprehended by authorities in recent years. Border Patrol apprehension data illustrate the changing demographic profile of border-crossers since the beginning of the Trump administration. In 2017, 53 percent of southwestern apprehensions were of people from the so-called “Northern Triangle” countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. By 2019, this proportion increased to 71 percent (CBP 2020f) (see Figure 3). Trump’s constant critique of what he described as “open borders,” as well as his threats to eliminate asylum have likely contributed to this increase in asylum-based migration. While this demographic change began in earnest in 2014 as crime and violence simultaneously began forcing people to leave Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, an expanded awareness of the asylum process has led to changes in the way people have attempted to cross the border in recent years. Rather than attempting to cross the border and avoid detection, people have begun to seek out CBP agents so they can declare fear of returning to their countries of origin and initiate the asylum process. However, the major increase in 2019 does not track with any significant changes on the ground in Central America. It is still too early to fully understand what drove this recent migration, but it is likely a combination of opportunity through “migrant caravans” that decreased the cost and danger of traveling through Mexico, as well as a higher profile given to the border and asylum by the Trump administration. Many individuals we have spoken to in the field expressed concern that this opportunity might not be available in the future and therefore they had to make the journey now.
Increased apprehensions, the changing profile of those apprehended, and changes in people’s modes of crossing have played significant roles in altering US-Mexico border enforcement during the Trump presidency. These changes have also effectively turned debates over unauthorized immigration into a fight about asylum. With an insistence on calling asylum seekers “illegals,” the Trump administration has staked a position against people’s legal right to apply for asylum. In fact, this discourse seems to have made its way into CBP’s everyday encounters with migrants seeking asylum. Recent research conducted at a migrant shelter in Arizona found that asylum seekers who have been granted “notices to appear” reported that CBP agents routinely treated them like criminals or made them feel as if they had engaged in illegal activity by seeking asylum, despite being well within their right to do so (Dormer 2019).
The discourse equating asylum seekers with criminals has led to numerous attacks on asylum, including: (1) an attempt to prevent people who cross between ports of entry from applying for asylum that was struck down by the courts; (2) a ban on applications from asylum-seekers who have failed to first apply for asylum in a third country (still in litigation but in effect); (3) “metering”; (4) the Migrant Protection Protocols; (5) PACR/HARP–rapid asylum trials with no legal representation; and (6) family separation policies. All these programs largely follow the same logic of previous enforcement modalities: make the process more difficult, dangerous, and expensive while increasing suffering so that people give up their claims or do not attempt to migrate in the first place.
The construction of a new border wall and family separation are the policies that have generated the most visibility and outrage during Trump’s tenure. However, the broader assault on legal immigration, both through asylum, as well as limiting refugees, visa applicants, and the refusal to renew passports or the denaturalization of US citizens, particularly through scrutiny of birth certificates from midwives along the border, are each cause for concern (Sieff 2018). These processes, which are occurring with less fanfare and outrage, are in fact more effective in realizing the broader goals of preventing demographic change and limiting foreigners from entering and integrating into the United States. The issues with border enforcement are part of a wider turn against all forms of immigration, legal and unauthorized, from all international sources.
Border Enforcement and the COVID-19 Pandemic 
The Trump administration has used the COVID-19 pandemic as a rationale for drastically altering immigration policy, with profound consequences on the border and the operations of CBP (Slack and Heyman 2020). In fact, COVID-19 has provided the cover to enact all of the Trump administration’s most drastic and draconian policies, effectively ending asylum and severely limiting many forms of legal migration. According to reports, persons arrested at the border are summarily removed from the United States to Mexico with an average of ninety minutes in processing time. Others are returned to their home countries, although there are still questions about who is being sent where and why, including asylum-seekers and other people with claims of protection. With these policies in place, asylum at the US-Mexico border has in practice come to an end. While exceptions exist for migrants who can make a case to the arresting officer of fear covered by the Convention Against Torture (which will soon require that they meet a heightened standard) and persons whom officers believe are trafficked, these narrow exceptions are at the discretion of CBP officers. Past studies have shown that CBP officers have ignored evidence of fear and trafficking (USCIRF 2016). Additionally, Border Patrol agents have taken a larger role in conducting credible fear interviews and have rejected claims at a significantly higher rate than Asylum Officers.
Such barriers have reduced arriving migrants’ hope of receiving asylum or otherwise gaining admission to the United States, but they have not completely ended movement northward by other means. Desperate asylum-seekers still arrive at the border, as do non-asylum seeking migrants. A smaller proportion of non-Mexicans and family groups are arrested, but more Mexicans and more men enter. Unable to enter via an open process, current field research suggests that migrants seem to have shifted to the more expensive option of smugglers and to more sophisticated or dangerous modes of entry. It is too recent to measure effects on changes in the undocumented population inside the United States, using demographic methods, and arrests represent interdicted attempts, but border arrests do continue at a substantial level (452,665 apprehensions/inadmissibles Oct. 1, 2019-June 30, 2020 [CBP 2020g]). The border closure is likely to follow the same path of border militarization in the 1990s and will likely increase migrant deaths. However, further escalations of state-sanctioned violence along the border are a constant threat and people must be aware of the potential for this possibility.
The asylum hearings of persons subject to the MPP have been indefinitely suspended during the pandemic. However, MPP-status asylum-seekers were still forced to line up at 4 AM to check in and receive a new court date. Those that did not present themselves at the port of entry on their original court date to receive a rescheduled hearing date were ordered removed in abstentia. This practice ended in July as the docket was moved online, but many asylum seekers are not aware of the changes and still present themselves for their hearings. New asylum-seekers are simply removed to Mexico or to their home countries, and enrolled in MPP without any definitive hearing date.
During 2018 and 2019 a substantial number of people were subjected to “metering”; that is, made to wait at ports of entry to be able to apply for asylum. This process led to lists of thousands of names run by a variety of governmental and non-governmental organizations along the US-Mexico border. During the pandemic, these lists have disappeared; however, people who present themselves at ports of entry to apply for asylum are being turned away. This exercise in futility has been called the “Corona Returns” locally. Little is known about this group of people, including how many have stayed in Mexico, returned home, or crossed into the US between ports of entry. Nonetheless, it is clear that a highly vulnerable population of migrants remains stuck in Mexican northern border cities.
Legal border crossings also continue, though numbers are down. Under an agreement reached between the United States and Mexico, US citizens and lawful permanent residents are permitted to return to the United States but may encounter a health check going through the land border to Mexico. The agreement also allows the admission of other categories of “essential” travelers, which include Mexican business people, farmworkers, health workers, and even some shoppers. While categories of border crossers have been defined officially, in our field experience, more often than not, the vital decision on whether a would-be crosser is “essential” is left to the discretion of CBP officers at ports of entry. Port traffic is down significantly, but questioning at US ports lasts longer and waits have remained prolonged.
Conclusion
Enforcement of the US-Mexico border has intensified dramatically over the past three decades, as signaled by increased Border Patrol staffing and budget allocations. Nevertheless, the Border Patrol and CBP, more generally, operate with little external oversight or accountability. Despite significant changes in migration patterns, these abuses have continued under the Trump administration, which may be in part attributed to the abhorrent xenophobic discourse perpetuated by the president and his closest advisors, an anti-immigrant organizational culture within CBP itself, and specific border enforcement policies stemming from Executive Order 13767. Perhaps the most significant shift in border enforcement during the Trump administration has been the effort to push immigration enforcement south of the US-Mexico border through agreements with the Mexican government to arrest and remove “transmigrants” passing through Mexico, the Migrant Protection Protocols, and “metering.” Given these changes, it is imperative that social scientists expand their focus to include examining asylum-seekers’ experiences while in a state of limbo near the border, while also continuing to gather reliable and valid data on migrants’ treatment in US custody. In what follows, we provide specific recommendations that might help alleviate some of the key concerns raised in this paper, with specific attention to diminishing the mistreatment of migrants in US custody.
Recommendations
The goal is to improve CBP’s culture, to instill professional standards of conduct, and to develop an internal organizational culture that accepts both accountability and transparency. Our recommendations refer to Border Patrol agents and CBP officers. The recommendations principally respond to the review above of CBP conduct and accountability, but we include some additional topics since this list functions as a unified source for suggested actions affecting the border that can be done administratively.
Hiring
CBP should review and improve its hiring process to ensure that it is identifying potential problem officers/agents. The current hiring process requires a polygraph test, background checks, and evaluations of applicants. These procedures should be strengthened, and CBP should adhere to the overall standards for federal law enforcement agencies, including best practices in vetting, and investigations and checks of employees. It should not hire officers/agents that have been decertified by other law enforcement agencies. To this end, CBP should participate in the National Decertification Index.
CBP should develop and implement plans to increase the hiring of women, other under-represented groups, and college-educated officers/agents. It should review posted qualifications to encourage and increase applications from individuals with experience in child welfare and family trauma.
Improving Officer/Agent Experience and Outcomes
CBP should develop a robust conduct data analysis system to cover officers/agents and units, and which focuses on patterns of abuse and other issues. This system should include complaints, officer/agent discipline, and trend analyses regarding potentially and actual deadly force incidents.
CBP should design and implement a strong data-based early intervention system, which includes patterns of public/migrant complaints, self- and other officer/agent-evaluation, and behaviors such as absence and tardiness.
CBP should train supervisors and officers/agents in stress- and frustration-recognition and handling.
The CBP Commissioner’s office should institute an initiative to improve the climate for women and other underrepresented groups in the organization, including a review of harassment protocols.
Make Conduct Principles Extend Across the Entire Organization and Its Activities
CBP should take a transversal approach to conduct improvement described in this document. Principles and guidelines that are originally taught in the academy are reinforced in post-academy and are central to periodic evaluation, retention, and promotion. Implementation of and performance by subordinates on these principles should be central to supervisor/manager evaluation, retention, and promotion at all levels. The record of standards implementation, performance improvement, and progressive discipline should be a core expectation for supervisors and criteria for their evaluation. CBP should develop written policies and practices for progressive discipline on these standards, up to termination, and train managers on effective discipline. CBP should finalize and implement current draft penalty guidelines. CBP should develop indicators of implementation of these standards across all levels, and act on those indicators in evaluating and governing CBP management.
CBP should affirm that it is the duty for officers/agents to intervene to stop and to report any misconduct, including verbal and physical abuse. CBP should reward, not retaliate against, officers who report misconduct.
CBP should finalize and publish its policy for investigation of suspected disciplinary and conduct cases, including clarifying jurisdiction of the Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), flow of information, communication with complainants, expected standard punishments, and finalization and implementation of decisions. CBP should resume publishing comprehensive reports from OPR, semi-annually, and issue a full public accounting of which the Integrity Advisory Panel recommendations from 2015-16 have been implemented and when remaining ones will be. It should set a standard above which misconduct must be referred to the Joint Intake Center, copying OPR, and should discipline supervisors for keeping such misconduct cases to themselves. CBP should end informal resolution and cease allowing field office and sector leadership to overrule disciplinary actions taken at headquarters.
CBP should establish an independent civilian review board with sufficient investigatory resources. All cases above a threshold (to be defined explicitly) must be reviewed by the board; the review board also should have the power to review all cases or conduct at its discretion, including past cases, and to observe Discipline Review Board and Use of Force Review Board (national and local) proceedings. A random selection of misconduct cases should be reviewed annually by this independent board to evaluate the appropriate handling and resolution of cases. CBP should task the new board with initial policy reviews of (1) BORTAC’s role and limits on its deployment and (2) legal positions taken by CBP on cases brought by individuals or families harmed by officers and agents. The reports of the board should be public and issued simultaneously to the Commissioner and Inspector General of DHS.
CBP should initiate a review of the collective bargaining agreements with unions representing law-enforcement personnel. This review should be led by an outside labor law expert with experience in law-enforcement CBAs and include other outside nongovernmental stakeholders. The review should assess and recommend changes to CBP’s disciplinary process, including an assessment of whether the current protocol of OPR reporting on policy violations and Human Resources deciding disciplinary recommendations is effective, with reference to the 2016 Pivotal Practices report done for CBP.
Abuse and Mistreatment Reduction
CBP should improve training (academy and post-academy/refresher), and in conjunction, establish and reinforce standards of conduct through regular and case-based evaluations to reduce loss after training. Such standards should include: social and cultural background of migration and migrants (including indigenous people, women, children, asylum-seekers, and other non-traditional migrants); fundamentals of human rights and constitutional rights (overall principles as well as specific laws and procedures); real-world problem-solving (beyond memorizing laws) involving human and constitutional rights; lawful use of force, de-escalation tactics, and alternatives to the use of force; implicit bias and racial profiling; and appropriate interaction (language, physical actions, expressed attitudes) with migrants and the public. CBP should include non-agency experts in training on these and other topics; bring CBP fully within DOJ’s 2014 Guidance for Federal Law Enforcement Agencies Regarding the Use of Race, Ethnicity, Gender, National Origin, Religion, Sexual Orientation, or Gender Identity; and issue a DHS counterpart.
Agents and officers should be accountable for failures to implement the law, policy, and standards on which they are trained. The supervisory hierarchy should be accountable from first-line supervisors to top of CBP and DHS for officer/agent conduct in their areas. Accountability includes handling of complaints and other evidence of misbehavior, thorough investigation of and action on specific cases, and overall conduct of units under supervisors/managers. Accountability includes documentation of incidents, investigation of incidents, and the command review of/solutions for patterns and trends. CBP should require this to be central in supervisory/managerial evaluation and promotion.
Officers/agents should receive, record, and process all statements suggesting fear without judging or discouraging them. Likewise, they should refrain from making any comments on potential asylum. CBP should train officers/agents on, issue standards for, and evaluate them on appropriate interactions with any people who indicate any fear of persecution or evidence of trafficking. Officers/agents should effectively record statements of fear and effectuate prompt turnover to asylum officers or ICE, as appropriate. The CBP role in I-213s should be as devoid of obstacles and automatic as possible. Quality control should be instituted based on random recordings used only to ensure appropriate officer conduct, not introduced as evidence in immigration proceedings.
CBP and ICE should eliminate expedited removal. They should not prosecute or initiate removal proceedings for asylum applicants until a decision on asylum is completed, and only prosecute them in extraordinary circumstances presenting serious non-immigration offenses. This should be done in conjunction with cessation of the exclusion of asylum seekers under the CDC regulation authorizing suspension of entry of persons to prevent communicable disease (see Asylum Policies).
CBP should train on, issue standards for, and evaluate on appropriate dealings with all persons. This should include instruction on screening, identifying, and responding to vulnerable populations, such as children, victims of human trafficking, indigenous people, and the acutely ill. CBP should train on, issue standards for, and evaluate on sensitivity towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals. CBP should train on, issue standards for, and evaluate on standards to reduce racism, conscious or unconscious, in interactions. CBP should train on, issue standards for, and evaluate on non-biased questioning and interactions. Officer/agent interactions with all persons, and especially vulnerable people, should encourage and not discourage them from expressing fear or evidence of persecution and trafficking; and initiating, recording, and submitting I-213s should be effective and devoid of barriers.
Verbal and physical abuse are unacceptable. CBP should establish and enforce standards of appropriate speech that proscribe verbal abuse, and that distinguish command speech from abusive speech. CBP should establish and enforce standards in which specific physical actions are necessary and not injurious, and those beyond are proscribed as abusive. These standards should be central to officer/agent evaluation, with serious consequences for their violation; and effective enactment of such standards likewise should be central to the evaluation of supervisors and managers.
CBP should eliminate sexual and other harassment and assault, internal and external to the organization. CBP should assess current policies and procedures to investigate cases and complaints to ensure that they are rapid, effective, and consequential.
Use of Force
The CBP force policy must include detailed protocols related to officer/agent documentation of incidents, the investigation of incidents, and the command review of patterns and trends. CBP should track and provide statistics on all cases where weapons are drawn, whether used on not.
CBP should make public existing standards for vehicular pursuit and shooting at vehicles, and issue strengthened standards that weigh risks (to officer/agent, community, migrants, and guides) against law enforcement objectives. CBP should promptly complete investigation and review of vehicular pursuit cases and implement recommendations.
Other improvements in use of force and related issues can be done administratively by CBP: these include prohibition of chokeholds; new standards for thrown projectiles that weigh actual risk against use of force options; and standards that minimize cross-border use of force by requiring self-protection and de-escalation by retreat into the United States. CBP should establish a standard of exhausting all alternatives before shooting or striking with a vehicle, and only when fully justified under Tennessee v. Garner. CBP should train to and implement the PERF de-escalation training and practice recommendations to support that standard. Agents/officers have a duty to de-escalate from potential use of force as much as possible.
CBP should make public within 24 hours the facts of any use-of-force incident that results in serious injury or death (of an officer or a member of the public) and comply fully with the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013.
CBP must make clear to all agents/officers and supervisors that there will be a serious investigation of all force and misconduct cases, with appropriate consequences even if no actual injury/death occurred. All National Use of Force Review Board (UFRB) and local UFRB reviews should be conducted promptly and reports posted publicly. The “no harm – no foul” practice can lead to tacit approval of bad practices. Officers/agents must be certain that they will be forced to give true and complete accounts of why they used force, and CBP must fully discipline them. CBP must implement use of body-worn cameras for all officers/agents, and penalize cameras not being turned on.
The DHS Inspector General (OIG) should review all case investigations above a published threshold of seriousness that are closed without action taken for completeness and appropriate application of standards. In cases where OIG identifies problems in the investigations, OIG should reopen them. OIG should publish reviews of all cases for completeness and appropriate application of standards. The public reports should identify problems and deficiencies and include recommendations for improvement in investigation and reporting, as well as information about particular cases. The external civilian review board described above should annually review a sample of cases for adequacy of the disciplinary process and issue a public report on the same. Recommendations from the OIG and public review board shall be implemented as promptly as possible. Supervisors should be held responsible for all limitations in case investigation/review and action. CBP should end port directors’/sector chiefs’ ability to override disciplinary recommendations from Headquarters.
Case records should be public information, including officer/agent names, camera footage consistent with policy, locations, events, and outcomes, and investigatory resolution. CBP counsel should cease arguing otherwise.
Holding Cells, Documents and Possessions, and Transportation
CBP should ensure that all persons in custody—children, families, and adults—have access to good food, drinking water, appropriate space (space to sit and to sleep), appropriate vehicle and room temperature (within a range used by GSA, not correctional guidelines), sanitation and hygiene, medical care (including mental health care), and access to communication and direct consultation with legal representation and family members. Personnel must conduct themselves in a courteous manner and absolutely no verbal, physical, and sexual abuse by CBP personnel will be permitted. TEDS and Flores decision standards should be required in all cases, and supervisors should be responsible for adherence, indicated in regular evaluations.
CBP should follow the 12-hour limit on CBP (Ports and Border Patrol) detention stated in the 2008 Border Patrol Detention Standards. People should not be held outside buildings except for fully sheltered and serviced tents. CBP should strengthen medical care in holding and transportation, including first response (with review by nongovernmental medical groups such as Physicians for Human Rights and the American Academy of Pediatrics), and should not take medications away from arrested or detained people unless approved by a doctor.
CBP should regularly provide the public with specific data on processing and holding capacity of ports and BP stations, including both space and personnel. Non-governmental monitoring organizations should be identified and invited for regular standards inspections in all major Border Patrol sectors/OFO districts.
CBP should improve the handling of documents and possessions, including full accountability for all such items, tracking, and return of all nonperishable items that are not contraband. It should establish a uniform set of policies and procedures for the handling and movement of possessions that is specific to immigration detainees, rather than to the institution that currently holds them in custody; clear channels should be implemented to recuperate lost possessions; and CBP should maintain a chain of custody that can easily be followed to help people retrieve their belongings. Document seizure by officers/agents should always require a written justification and a process for recovery when appropriate. CBP should provide regular training of agents/officers on documents, including new ones, and how to handle documents in the field.
Border Communities and Ports
CBP should require agents to have fully articulated fact-justification for search and seizure on local roads and streets, paths, parks, and other community spaces, and should hold supervisors accountable for the performance of agents. Border Patrol agents should only enter yards or dwellings with judicial warrants or direct witnessing of law violation, and should not deceive or use physical force to enter such spaces or place cameras. CBP should record, track, and report on the race and ethnicity of people stopped and questioned inside the 100 mile zone in inhabited areas, on streets and roads, in private vehicles, and in public carriers and private vehicles. At checkpoints, Border Patrol should record and track the race and ethnicity of people detained for longer than a brief immigration inquiry and all those pulled into secondary. CBP should develop standards, policies, and procedures to address inequities seen in this data.
Distant surveillance must be as limited by the standards of reasonable suspicion (or higher) as in-person searches. CBP should develop and apply this policy specifically for border communities within the 100-mile zone. For each sector, evaluate what a “reasonable distance” for operations is and reduce the zone accordingly. End measurements of “reasonable distance” that do not begin at an external boundary, such as using the Great Lakes as “functional equivalents” of the border.
CBP should hold regular non-uniformed community liaison meetings, post liaison emails and phone numbers, and make complaint process efficient and accessible. CBP should improve relations with border communities, including reduced surveillance and use of lights, entry into homes and sensitive locations, better interactions with the public, and caution with vehicular pursuits.
CBP should end boarding of common carriers other than those crossing international borders, and end presence at transportation hubs. CBP should limit apprehensions of people in the 100-mile zone to those people who actually have entered the border in the last 14 days. CBP should eliminate use of expedited removal and use prosecutions only in extraordinary cases involving serious non-immigration violations; all legal actions should require full non-expedited processes.
CBP and ICE should affirm the sensitive location memos and strictly require them of officers/agents. CBP and ICE should add courthouses and other locations for legal processing to the sensitive locations memos. Officers/agents should be knowledgeable about policies for operating in locations where there are limitations on cooperation by local law enforcement.
CBP should review canine operations with external experts to recommend changes to improve efficacy and respect individual rights.
CBP should review drone operations with external experts to establish privacy protections and limit loans to other agencies to exceptional circumstances.
CBP should initiate a major program to improve performance of land ports of entry, including standards of interaction with the public. CBP should evaluate officers on interaction with the public and supervisors on the performance of their officers, including routine randomized review of recordings from inspection booths. CBP should provide well-displayed, multilingual signage at ports on complaint procedures. Professionalism Service Managers emails and phone numbers should be posted online and on signage. CBP should provide real-time transparency regarding crossing times.
CBP should provide accountability and transparency for search and seizure at ports; all seizure of documents and personal technologies and investigative detention require written reasons based on detailed, articulable facts. CBP should permit and improve counsel access at Ports. Camera recording of interactions and holding cells should be retained for at least a year.
CBP should address the social and economic costs of under-resourced ports relative to enforcement outside ports. CBP should stop using ports as personnel reserves for the Border Patrol; instead, CBP should study the economic and social benefits of re-assigning of Border Patrol as CBP inspectors at ports to improve legitimate trade and travel, and interdict contraband.
CBP should restore dedicated pedestrian lanes for US citizens and Legal Permanent Residents where they previously existed. CBP should restore the dedicated pedestrian lane for students where they previously existed. CBP should restore the “All Lanes Open Initiative,” which kept all bridge lanes staffed during morning rush hours. CBP should cease “port-hardening measures” including concrete barriers topped with razor wire that create a choke point at the top of the bridges, take down limit line booths, and cease stopping traffic at ports to practice “tactical exercises.”
Complaints
The complaint process should be open, accessible, and streamlined, with a toll-free phone number and online portal, available in all widely used languages. CBP should provide an opportunity for people to place complaints prior to removal or release. Complainants, including third parties, should be given the option to submit anonymously or with identification. Retaliation for complaints should be strictly punished. An external review board should adjudicate complaints. CBP should develop a mechanism for communicating complaint outcomes to complainants and should keep records of its follow-through on all complaints. It should develop safeguards to prevent retribution by officer/agents against complainants, including monitoring individual complainants’ routine treatment at ports of entry for signs of retaliation.
CBP should analyze complaints to identify patterns that can be addressed and improved; this should be done for officers/agents, units, locations, and activities. CBP should keep records of how complaints have been addressed, both specific cases and in terms of general patterns at all levels of management. Use of the record in policy implementation, improvement, and progressive discipline is a core expectation for supervisors and criteria for their evaluation. CBP should produce an annual public report on complaints and improvement.
Officers/agents should never hide their identities, badges, or organizations, and will be seriously penalized for doing so.
CBP should provide rapid, effective, and complete response to FOIA requests, reviewing and improving existing guidelines, consulting stakeholders, and increasing resources as appropriate.
Minors
CBP should take immediate steps to improve the treatment of Unaccompanied Children (UAC) using the standards in the Flores settlement. CBP and other entities responsible for the care of UAC should be monitored to ensure their compliance with US law and policy. CBP should undertake a hiring initiative to recruit personnel with background or expertise in social work, child welfare, and/or child development to work with UAC.
Mexican UACs should be afforded the same procedures and protection under the TVPRA as UACs from noncontiguous states.
DHS should address the problem of the removal of children from parents and non-parental guardians. In particular, the burden of proof should be on the government to demonstrate that a child is a victim of trafficking or otherwise in imminent risk of bodily harm. This should require review by a court, or at least an independent child welfare expert. Children should be left in the custody of non-parental kin guardians (such as siblings, grandparents, aunts/uncles) unless such a burden of proof can be met. Family units should not undergo separation—all parents, minor children, and other adult relatives should be kept whole in CBP custody and released together.
CBP should create a coherent and functional tracking system for all UAC, including the exceptional case of children removed from adults.
Other
CBP should not refer migrants for prosecution under 8 USC sec. 1325(a) and 8 USC sec. 1326(a). CBP and federal prosecutors should investigate and pursue persons suspected of involvement in smuggling, trafficking, and other offenses under the relevant provisions in the federal code. Revise the Consequence Delivery System accordingly and create a mechanism for external input on a new version.
Border Patrol agents and CBP officers should not serve as Asylum Officers.
Under the authority of DHS, active duty military and National Guard should be disengaged from border enforcement, including training exercises, surveillance, construction, and logistics.
DHS should stop border wall construction by halting all land acquisition proceedings and all contracting (open or pending), and establish a commission to review and redress the harms of existing barriers including removal where feasible.
DHS should commission external studies on the risks and outcomes of interior checkpoints at the northern and southern borders, which capture data on racial inequities in searches.
Consistent with existing budgets, CBP should administratively reallocate internal resources to increase the number of OPR investigators.
CBP should end its prevention-through-deterrence strategy. Border Patrol agents–who are required to aid migrants when asked–should be forbidden, with serious consequences, from damaging and destroying life-saving resources such as water caches. Border Patrol search and rescue resources should be bolstered, including beacons and cooperation with nongovernmental organizations.

CBP Enforcement Statistics Fiscal Year 2020
Printer-friendly version
U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the nation’s largest federal law enforcement agency charged with securing the nation’s borders and facilitating international travel and trade. Our top priority is to keep terrorists and their weapons from entering the United States.
At the nation’s more than 300 ports of entry, CBP officers have a complex mission with broad law enforcement authorities tied to screening all foreign visitors, returning American citizens and imported cargo that enters the U.S. Along the nation’s borders, the United States Border Patrol and Air and Marine Operations are the uniformed law enforcement arms of CBP responsible for securing U.S. borders between ports of entry.
The following is a summary of CBP enforcement actions related to inadmissibles, apprehensions, arrests of individuals with criminal convictions and individuals who have been apprehended multiple times crossing the border illegally.
Visit CBP's Southwest Border Migration page for demographic information regarding apprehensions and inadmissibles on the southwest border and the Use of Force page for use-of-force statistics and case summaries.

        Maritime Law Enforcement Program
The Maritime Law Enforcement program protects America’s maritime borders from encroachment, defends our Nation’s maritime sovereignty from illicit activity, facilitates legitimate use of the waterways, and suppresses violations of federal law on, under and over the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The Coast Guard is the lead federal maritime law enforcement agency and the only agency with both the authority and capability to enforce national and international law on the high seas, outer continental shelf, and inward from the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to inland waters. Coast Guard responsibilities include detecting and interdicting contraband and illegal drug traffic; at sea enforcement of U.S. immigration laws and policies; enforcing our Nation’s fisheries and marine protected resource laws and regulations; ensuring the integrity of the EEZ, monitoring compliance with international living marine resource regimes and international agreements to which the U.S. is party; and through compliance with international agreements, combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing that negatively impacts maritime and economic security in coastal and regional areas worldwide.

Against Their Will: The Situation in Xinjiang
Against Their Will: The Situation in Xinjiang
The People's Republic of China has arbitrarily detained more than one million Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in China's far western Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. (1) It is estimated that 100,000 Uyghurs and other ethnic minority ex-detainees in China may be working in conditions of forced labor following detention in re-education camps. (2) Many more rural poor workers also may experience coercion without detention. (3; 4) China has been included on the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor of Forced Labor (TVPRA List) since 2009. In 2020, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) added five goods produced by forced labor by Muslim minorities in China to the 2020 edition of the TVPRA List. These goods include gloves, hair products, textiles, thread/yarn, and tomato products. In 2021, ILAB added an additional good, Polysilicon, produced by forced labor by Muslim minorities in China.
The production of these goods through forced labor takes place primarily in Xinjiang. (5) While previous research has focused on goods and products produced in Xinjiang, recent external reports indicate that Uyghurs also have been transported to work in other provinces in China, increasing the number of goods potentially made with forced labor and broadening the risk of forced labor in supply chains. (5; 3) Other minorities may be forced to work under the guise of ""poverty alleviation"" without having been detained. (6) Moreover, the government gives subsidies to companies moving to Xinjiang or employing Muslim minority workers. (2) These practices exacerbate a demand for members of Muslim ethnic minority groups that the government wants placed in work assignments where they can be controlled and watched, as well as receive Mandarin Chinese training and undergo political indoctrination. (2) Once at a work placement, workers are usually subjected to constant surveillance and isolation. Given the vast surveillance state in Xinjiang and the threat of detention, individuals have little choice but to face the difficult situations present in these work assignments. (3)
The Department of Labor's (DOL) research utilized published victims' testimonies, and media and think tank reports, to determine the various industries implicated in this system of forced labor. Given the vast state-sponsored structure in place and the control of information, it is likely that more goods also are produced with forced labor in China. (7) In July 2020, the U.S. Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security released an advisory for businesses with potential ties to Xinjiang. This business advisory, as well as the TVPRA List and ILAB's Comply Chain due diligence tool for businesses, are practical guides for raising awareness and addressing this issue. Companies with supply chains that link to China, including, but not limited to, Xinjiang, should conduct due diligence to ensure that suppliers are not engaging in forced labor. With such severe and well-documented, widespread abuses, it is important that the world remains vigilant with respect to labor and goods linked to Xinjiang, including reasonable measures to guard against complicity in these violations.
Two Stories, One Goal: Repression
The People's Republic of China officially recognizes 55 ethnic groups in addition to the Han majority. Uyghurs are one of those groups. Along with other mostly Muslim minorities in China, Uyghurs confront abuse and discrimination in places like Xinjiang and elsewhere in the country.
Uyghurs detained in camps and forced to labor in factories must endure dreadful conditions. In one internment camp in Kashgar, Xinjiang, Uyghur detainees work as forced laborers to produce textiles. They receive little pay, are not allowed to leave, and have limited or no communication with family members. If family communication and visits are allowed, they are heavily monitored or cut short. When not working, the Uyghur workers must learn Mandarin and undergo ideological indoctrination. However, these abuses are not just limited to Xinjiang.
Beyond Xinjiang, in the coastal Chinese province of Fujian, Uyghur workers at a factory in Quanzhou face similar abuses. Uyghur workers are made to live in separate dormitories from Han workers. These dormitories are surrounded by an iron gate and security cameras. When finished for the day, often working more hours than their Han co-workers, the Uyghur workers are escorted back to their dormitories by provincial police officers from Xinjiang – not Fujian. The local police say the roll call is to ensure no one is missing. Uyghur workers at this factory are not allowed to exercise their free will to leave. Even if they could leave, they would not get far, as local police have confiscated their identification materials.
Sadly, these two stories fail to capture the individual struggles of the more than one million Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities arbitrarily detained in the far western region of Xinjiang and across China. These two stories are just a snapshot of the vast scale of abuse and serve as a notice for the world to ask questions, take action, and demand change.

China – Gloves – Forced Labor
There are reports of glove factories forcibly training and employing 1,500 to 2,000 ethnic minority adult workers with the government's support. Victim testimonies, news media, and think tanks report that factories, including for gloves, frequently engage in coercive recruitment; limit workers' freedom of movement and communication; and subject workers to constant surveillance, retribution for religious beliefs, exclusion from community and social life, and isolation. Further, reports indicate little pay, mandatory Mandarin lessons, ideological indoctrination, and poor living conditions. In some instances, workers have been reported to be subject to torture. More broadly, according to varied estimates, at least 100,000 to hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities are being subjected to forced labor in China following detention in re-education camps. In addition to this, poor workers in rural areas may also experience coercion without detention. Workers are either placed at factories within the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where the camps are located, or transferred out of Xinjiang to factories in eastern China.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection services for trademark owners
Some imported goods bear trademarks that are counterfeits or infringing versions of federally registered trademarks. The importation of such goods threatens the U.S. economy, the competitiveness of our businesses, and in some cases, the health and safety of consumers. 
Recording your trademark registration
If your business’s products are likely targets for international counterfeiters (e.g., popular or high-demand products), consider applying to record your trademark registration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Recording your trademark registration helps CBP detain and seize imported goods if they violate your recorded trademark. The recordation process is a critical tool in CBP’s efforts to protect intellectual property rights at the border. 

To record with CBP, you must: 
Own a federally registered trademark. Your trademark must be on the Principal Register. It must be registered for use on goods. 
Apply for recordation. You can apply electronically or on paper. Apply electronically using CBP’s Intellectual Property Rights Recordation system(link is external).
Pay the application fee. There is a fee for recording your trademark registration with CBP.
Periodically apply to renew. To maintain your recordation, you must apply for renewal and pay renewal fees at regular intervals that correspond to your trademark registration renewal at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Trademark owners who record with CBP often provide information to CBP about authorized manufacturers and importers as well as potential unauthorized shipments to aid in CBP’s efforts to detain and seize infringing goods before they enter the U.S. market. 
Checking for unauthorized recordation
To ensure your registration hasn't been recorded by an unauthorized party, check the Intellectual Property Rights Search system(link is external) for your trademark.
Contact CBP’s Intellectual Property Rights Branch at iprrquestions@cbp.dhs.gov(link sends email) or 202-325-0020 for assistance. 

Learn more about CBP’s role in protecting intellectual property rights on the CBP website(link is external).

What Can I Bring?
Planning ahead and packing properly can facilitate the screening process and ease your travel experience at the airport. Know what you can pack in your carry-on and checked baggage before arriving at the airport by reviewing the lists below.

Border Security
Border Patrol History
Since its inception in 1924, the U.S. Border Patrol has had a proud history of service to our nation. Although enormous changes have affected nearly every aspect of its operations from its earliest days, the basic values that helped shape the Patrol in the early years; professionalism, honor, integrity, respect for human life, and a shared effort, have remained.
The Origins of the Border Patrol
Mounted watchmen of the U.S. Immigration Service patrolled the border in an effort to prevent illegal crossings as early as 1904, but their efforts were irregular and undertaken only when resources permitted. The inspectors, usually called Mounted Guards, operated out of El Paso, Texas. Though they never totaled more than seventy-five, they patrolled as far west as California trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.
In March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of Mounted Guards, often referred to as Mounted Inspectors. Most rode on horseback, but a few operated cars and even boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese immigrants trying to avoid the Chinese exclusion laws. These patrolmen were Immigrant Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times. Military troops along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to ""the more serious work of military training."" Aliens encountered illegally in the U.S. by the military were directed to the immigration inspection stations. Texas Rangers were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as ""singularly effective.""
Always referred to as ""the first Immigration Border Patrolman"", Jeff Milton (left) poses outside the Birdcage Theatre in Tombstone, Arizona. Milton became a Texas Ranger in 1879 and later joined the U.S. Immigration Service, retiring in 1932. Milton died at his home in 1947 and according to his wishes, his ashes were scattered in the Arizona desert.
Customs violations and intercepting communications to ""the enemy"" seemed to be of a greater concern than enforcing immigration regulations in the early years of the twentieth century. Agencies charged with inspecting people and goods entering and leaving the U.S. noticed that their efforts were totally ineffective without border enforcement between inspection stations. After 1917, a higher head tax and literacy requirement imposed for entry prompted more people to try to enter illegally.
In 1918, Supervising Inspector Frank W. Berkshire wrote to the Commissioner-General of Immigration expressing his concerns about the lack of a coordinated, adequate effort to enforce immigration and customs laws along the border with Mexico.
Prohibition and Border Control
The Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, prohibiting the importation, transport, manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages went into effect at midnight on January 16, 1920. With the passage of this constitutional amendment and the numerical limits placed on immigration to the United States by the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924, border enforcement received renewed attention from the government. The numerical limitations resulted in people from around the world to try illegal entry if attempts to enter legally failed. Therefore, the mission of the Border Patrol became more important to the U.S. Government.
These events set the wheels of change into motion. On May 28, 1924, Congress passed the Labor Appropriation Act of 1924, officially establishing the U.S. Border Patrol for the purpose of securing the borders between inspection stations. In 1925 its duties were expanded to patrol the seacoast.
The Early Years
Officers were quickly recruited for the new positions. The Border Patrol expanded to 450 officers. Many of the early agents were recruited from organizations such as the Texas Rangers, local sheriffs and deputies, and appointees from the Civil Service Register of Railroad Mail Clerks.
The government initially provided the agents a badge and revolver. Recruits furnished their own horse and saddle, but Washington supplied oats and hay for the horses and a $1,680 annual salary for the agents. The agents did not have uniforms until 1928.
In 1932 the Border Patrol was placed under the authority of two directors, one in charge of the Mexican border office in El Paso, the other in charge of the Canadian border office in Detroit. Liquor smuggling was a major concern because it too often accompanied alien smuggling. The majority of the Border Patrol was assigned to the Canadian border. Smuggling was commonplace along the Mexican border also. Whiskey bootleggers avoided the bridges and slipped their forbidden cargo across the Rio Grande by way of pack mules along the Southern border.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt combined the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization into the Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1933. The first Border Patrol Academy opened as a training school at Camp Chigas, El Paso, in December 1934. Thirty-four trainees attended classes in marksmanship and horsemanship.
Although horses remained the transportation of choice for many years, by 1935, the Border Patrol began using motorized vehicles with radios. Rugged terrain and the need for quick, quiet transportation guaranteed that horses would remain essential transportation to the Patrol even to the present day.
The War Years
The workload and accomplishments of the Patrol remained fairly constant until 1940, when the Immigration Service was moved from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice. An additional 712 agents and 57 auxiliary personnel brought the force to 1,531 officers. Over 1,400 people were employed by the Border Patrol in law enforcement and civilian positions by the end of WWII. During the war, the Patrol provided tighter control of the border, manned alien detention camps, guarded diplomats, and assisted the U.S. Coast Guard in searching for Axis saboteurs. Aircraft proved extremely effective and became an integral part of operations.
Border Patrol Role Expands
Legislation in 1952 codified and carried forward the essential elements of the 1917 and 1924 acts. The same year, Border Patrol agents were first permitted to board and search a conveyance for illegal immigrants anywhere in the United States. For the first time, illegal entrants traveling within the country were subject to arrest.
As illegal immigration continued along the Mexican border, sixty-two Canadian border units were transferred south for a large-scale repatriation effort. In 1952, the government airlifted 52,000 illegal immigrants back to the Mexican interior. The program was terminated after it ran out of funds during its first year. The Mexican government offered train rides into the Mexican interior for nationals being returned from the San Antonio and Los Angeles districts, but this program was halted after only five months. Throughout the early 1950s, a special taskforce of 800 Border Patrol agents was assigned by the United States Attorney General to round up and ship home thousands of illegal immigrants in southern California. The task force moved to the lower Rio Grande valley, then to Chicago and other interior cities. The Border Patrol began expelling adult Mexican males by boatlift from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz in September 1954. The project was discontinued two years later after nearly 50,000 illegal aliens had been returned home. Various other flights, train trips, and bus trips originated along the border and terminated in the Mexican interior. In spite of the major successes in repatriation, many deportees simply turned around and recrossed the seriously undermanned border. Repatriation programs proved extremely expensive and were phased out primarily because of cost.
Significant numbers of illegal aliens began entering the U.S. on private aircraft in the late 1950s. In cooperation with other federal services, the Border Patrol began tracking suspect flights. During the Cuban missile crisis of the early 1960s, Cuban defectors living in Florida flew aircraft out over the ocean in an effort to harass their former homeland. The American government made this harassment illegal, and assigned the Border Patrol to prevent unauthorized flights. The Patrol added 155 officers, but discharged 122 of them when the crisis ended in 1963.
The early 1960s also witnessed aircraft-hijacking attempts and President John F. Kennedy ordered Border Patrol agents to accompany domestic flights to prevent takeovers. The Miami Sector of the Border Patrol coordinated the effort. By that time the business of alien smuggling began to involve drug smuggling also. The Border Patrol assisted other agencies in intercepting illegal drugs from Mexico.
Today's Border Patrol
The 1980s and 1990s saw a tremendous increase of illegal migration to America. The Border Patrol responded with increases in manpower and the implementation of modern technology. Infrared night-vision scopes, seismic sensors, and a modern computer processing system helped the Patrol locate, apprehend, and process those crossing into the U.S. illegally.
In an effort to bring a level of control to the border, Operation ""Hold the Line"" was established in 1993 in El Paso, and proved an immediate success. Agents and technology were concentrated in specific areas, providing a ""show of force"" to potential illegal border crossers. The drastic reduction in apprehensions prompted the Border Patrol to undertake a full-scale effort in San Diego, California, which accounted for more than half of illegal entries. Operation ""Gatekeeper"" was implemented in 1994, and reduced illegal entries in San Diego by more than 75% over the next few years. A defined national strategic plan was introduced alongside Operation Gatekeeper and set out a plan of action for the Border Patrol into the future. With illegal entries at a more manageable level, the Patrol was able to concentrate on other areas, such as establishing anti-smuggling units and search and rescue teams such as BORSTAR. The Border Safety Initiative (BSI) was created in 1998 with a commitment by the Border Patrol and the promised cooperation of the Mexican government.
Homeland security became a primary concern of the nation after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Border security became a topic of increased interest in Washington. Funding requests and enforcement proposals were reconsidered as lawmakers began reassessing how our nation's borders must be monitored and protected. On March 1, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established, and the U.S. Border Patrol became part of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a component of DHS.
The U.S. Border Patrol continues its efforts to control our nation's borders. The 21st century promises to provide enormous leaps in technology that can be applied to border enforcement. The modernization of the Patrol advances at a dizzying rate as new generations of agents develop innovative ways to integrate the contemporary technology into field operations. New and specialized technology is being created within the Border Patrol that holds increasing potential to assist agents in fulfilling the mission of the Patrol. Additionally, cooperation with neighboring countries increases border safety and law enforcement efforts. The future of the U.S. Border Patrol promises to be as exciting and interesting as its past, and will continue to echo the motto that agents have lived by since 1924.
Honor First.

Home About DHS Organization Operational and Support Components Management Directorate Office of Biometric Identity Management Biometrics
Biometrics
Biometrics are unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints, that can be used for automated recognition. At the Department of Homeland Security, biometrics are used for detecting and preventing illegal entry into the U.S., granting and administering proper immigration benefits, vetting and credentialing, facilitating legitimate travel and trade, enforcing federal laws, and enabling verification for visa applications to the U.S.
DHS provides biometric identification services to protect the Nation through its Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM), which supplies the technology for matching, storing, and sharing biometric data. OBIM is the lead designated provider of biometric identity services for DHS, and maintains the largest biometric repository in the U.S. Government.
This system, called the Automated Biometric Identification System or IDENT, is operated and maintained by OBIM. IDENT currently holds approximately 300 million unique identities and processes more than 400,000 biometric transactions per day.
Through biometric interoperability with the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Justice (DoJ), DHS shares critical biometric information using advanced data filtering and privacy controls to support the homeland security, defense, and justice missions.

DHS/CBP/PIA-079 Guam-Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Visa Waiver Program
In general, nonimmigrant visitors to the U.S. territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) are required to obtain a visa from the U.S. Department of State before being admitted. CBP created the Guam-Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (G-CNMI) Visa Waiver Program (VWP) which allows certain nonimmigrant visitors to seek admission to Guam and/or the CNMI without a visa for a period of authorized stay not to exceed 45 days. Nonimmigrants use the Form I-736, Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Information, to determine eligibility to travel under the G-CNMI Visa Waiver Program. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is publishing this Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to provide notice and assess the privacy risks associated with the G-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, including the newly created restricted sub-program CNMI Economic Vitality & Security Travel Authorization Program (EVS-TAP), and the newly established electronic Form I-736, which is used to grant travel authorization to nonimmigrants prior to their embarkation to Guam or the CNMI.

DHS/TSA/PIA-046 Travel Document Checker Automation Using Facial Identification
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enhance the identity verification of passengers by using facial verification technology at airports. In a previous proof of concept, TSA used a Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) device equipped with a camera (CAT-C) to validate that the identity document presented by the passenger was authentic and to compare the passenger’s live facial image against the image from the passenger’s identity document. Building on its previous work, TSA will now network the CAT-C to the TSA Secure Flight system so that passenger boarding pass information can be passed from Secure Flight to the CAT-C. This will provide improved real-time boarding pass instructions with improved identity matching and reduced physical handling of travel documents to limit unnecessary exposure, such as during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Border Patrol Violently Assaults Civil Rights and Liberties
Ending Border Patrol’s long-standing abuses and impunity requires divestment, accountability, and removing the agency from U.S. communities.

In the past week, unidentified federal officers in camouflage fatigues, labeled only “police,” abducted people off the streets of Portland in unmarked vehicles and threatened the “Wall of Moms” standing up for our Constitution. The administration later confirmed the unidentified officers were Border Patrol agents.  
This blatant demonstration of unconstitutional authoritarianism is demonstrating to the entire country the cruel capabilities of the U.S. Border Patrol. For communities that have historically borne the brunt of Border Patrol’s abuses — and still do — seeing these agents pose as a “secret federal police” force on the streets of Portland is no surprise. The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency, which includes Border Patrol, has been conducting secret, violent arrests of immigrants for years.    
CBP is the largest federal law enforcement agency in the United States, with nearly 20,000 Border Patrol agents across the country. CBP, in fact, has the largest law enforcement air force in the world — roughly equivalent to the size of Brazil’s entire combat air force — including fleets of planes, helicopters, and Predator drones. 
CBP and Border Patrol have expanded rapidly for almost 20 years, since CBP was relocated into the then-newly formed DHS. Fueled by unprecedented funding from Congress, Border Patrol’s abuses have grown increasingly violent and common. Their militarized over policing of border communities is deeply rooted in the nation’s history of over-policing of Black and Brown people. 
At least 102 people have died as a result of encounters with Border Patrol in the last decade. Six of these deaths were caused by Border Patrol agents shooting across the border into Mexico — murders met with complete impunity. The agency also lacks basic accountability practices: No agent has ever been convicted of criminal wrongdoing while on duty, despite deaths in custody and uses of excessive, deadly force. Border Patrol agents engage in criminal activities outside their official duties at five times the rate of other law enforcement agencies’ officials. The agency’s discipline system is broken and agency leadership has not weeded out corrupt agents. As James Tomsheck, CBP’s former internal affairs chief, described the agency’s culture: It “goes out of its way to evade legal restraints” and is “clearly engineered to interfere with [oversight] efforts to hold the Border Patrol accountable.” 
U.S. border communities have long understood the cruel capacity and impunity of this rogue agency. Witness El Paso, Texas. In the last month alone, a Border Patrol chase resulted in the deadliest crash in the city’s history, killing seven people, including four locals. In separate incidents also this month, a Border Patrol agent ran over a migrant with his vehicle and deported the survivor before local reporting exposed the incident, and Border Patrol found a woman dying at the base of President Trump’s border wall and side-stepped investigating or reporting her death. These grotesque examples are in addition to the thousands of children and families subjected to rape, kidnapping, or disappearance after being subjected to CBP’s unlawful asylum policies, or the horrors of Border Patrol’s systematic abuse of migrants in its custody. 
While Border Patrol’s foundation of overreach and culture of cruelty predates President Trump, this administration has boasted that it took the proverbial “handcuffs” off the agency, fueling even more abuses and trampling the rights of migrants and border residents alike.
Since June, in response to nationwide protests against the murder of George Floyd, CBP deployed surveillance drones and helicopters over U.S. cities, including Buffalo, New York, Minneapolis, Miami, Chicago, and Philadelphia. CBP personnel flooded the streets of Washington, D.C. and other cities, with zero transparency around the agency’s mission, claimed authority, or any accountability for misconduct. As CBP officials cracked down on protesters in Portland, an internal DHS memo expressed the agency’s own concerns that CBP lacks the necessary training to respond to crowds or protests. Even with this knowledge, DHS has deployed these officers into our streets, with complete disregard for potential consequences. 
Now, the administration appears poised to expand its deployment of federal forces to what it calls “Democrat-run cities” across the country, including 150 agents to Chicago this week, risking another unconstitutional nightmare of police violence. This is a mistake that could prove lethal.
This month, the House of Representatives took important first steps in cutting funding to CBP and other immigration enforcement agencies. But reining in the nation’s largest and least accountable law enforcement agency will require divestment from the nation’s massive border agency, and reinvestment in Black and Brown communities. Just this week, DHS announced it is transferring funds, allocated for accountability measures, to pay for a surge in unaccountable CBP staffing and paychecks. This is unacceptable and dangerous. We must collectively dismantle the systems of racism and xenophobia that have allowed Border Patrol — with its bloated budget, overbroad authority, and staff of unaccountable agents — to terrorize and kidnap protesters from the streets of Portland and undermine the civil rights and liberties of all American communities, near and far from the border.

VAN HOLLEN, HARRIS, COLLEAGUES DEMAND ANSWERS ON FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE IN AMERICAN CITIES
Today, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and sixteen of their Senate colleagues sent a letter to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, and Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Matthew Albence demanding answers about the use of federal law enforcement against protestors expressing their constitutional First Amendment rights. Senator Van Hollen introduced legislation Monday with Senators Merkley and Wyden (both D-Ore.) to block the President from using federal police to occupy American cities as he has done in Portland, Oregon and threatens to do in various other cities – including Baltimore, Maryland. Senator Van Hollen discussed the situation in Portland and the legislation on MSNBC with Ali Velshi last night.
“Over the past week, multiple reports have emerged of federal authorities arresting demonstrators without any explanation in Portland, Oregon. These federal law enforcement officers have reportedly acted without displaying any identification or badges, and using unmarked vehicles, to detain individuals. Federal agents are reportedly using tear gas, rubber bullets, and acoustic weapons against demonstrators,” the senators wrote. 
They continued, “It is essential to understand precisely which DHS personnel are involved in these activities, relevant policies and procedures, and mechanisms for accountability in the event that personnel engage in misconduct.”
“People have taken to the streets to exercise their First Amendment rights and call for racial justice after the killing of George Floyd by individuals in the Minneapolis Police Department. The reported federal law enforcement actions in Portland, Oregon raise serious concerns in light of your statements implying that such actions will be replicated across the nation, including in Oakland, California. We therefore request that DHS, CBP, ICE, and FPS respond to all questions in the June 5 letter, along with the below questions, by July 28, 2020,” the senators concluded.
The senators asked a range of questions, including how many people federal law enforcement has detained, what documentation was being preserved on arrests, the list of equipment used by officers, and how DHS has addressed any complaints they have received.
Today’s letter was also signed by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Cory A. Booker (D-NJ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Christopher Murphy (D-CT), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Tom Udall (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
The full text of the letter is available here and below.
Dear Acting Secretary Wolf, Acting Commissioner Morgan, and Acting Director Albence:
We write today regarding deeply disturbing reports of U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel arresting, searching, and detaining individuals participating in demonstrations and protests. 
Over the past week, multiple reports have emerged of federal authorities arresting demonstrators without any explanation in Portland, Oregon. These federal law enforcement officers have reportedly acted without displaying any identification or badges, and using unmarked vehicles, to detain individuals. Federal agents are reportedly using tear gas, rubber bullets, and acoustic weapons against demonstrators. Demonstrators report feeling “terrified” because unidentified individuals in camouflage were driving around areas of Portland in unmarked vehicles grabbing individuals off the street.  One demonstrator reported that the experience is “like being preyed upon.” A Navy veteran was reportedly beaten with a baton, sprayed in the face with a chemical irritant, and suffered a broken hand. Pregnant mothers, standing at protests with their arms linked, were reportedly teargassed. 
It is essential to understand precisely which DHS personnel are involved in these activities, relevant policies and procedures, and mechanisms for accountability in the event that personnel engage in misconduct.  
DHS includes U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) (including Border Patrol Tactical Unit, or BORTAC), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) (including Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI), and the Federal Protective Service (FPS), each of which has been involved in the federal response to demonstrations nationwide since DHS first commenced these deployments. On June 5, 2020, Sen. Harris, Rep. Scanlon, and Rep. Vargas along with 96 members of Congress wrote to CBP and ICE asking them a number of questions about these deployments, including what identification and equipment personnel are carrying, what forms of force they are authorized to use, how they are protecting the public’s constitutional rights and safety, and what surveillance they are conducting during these deployments. On June 25, 2020, during a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Acting CBP Commissioner Morgan was questioned about concerns with these deployments. To date, CBP and ICE have not responded to the letter.  In the meantime, deployments have continued, including under a newly formed task force created by Executive Order 13933, and multiple reports have emerged of people experiencing the sheer terror of being arrested by unidentified law enforcement for exercising their constitutional right to protest. 
People have taken to the streets to exercise their First Amendment rights and call for racial justice after the killing of George Floyd by individuals in the Minneapolis Police Department. The reported federal law enforcement actions in Portland, Oregon raise serious concerns in light of your statements implying that such actions will be replicated across the nation, including in Oakland, California. We therefore request that DHS, CBP, ICE, and FPS respond to all questions in the June 5 letter, along with the below questions, by July 28, 2020:
How many individuals have been detained or arrested for any period of time, regardless of whether charges were eventually filed, as part of these deployments? For each individual, please provide their age, the basis for the arrest or detention, the location, whether any charges were filed and, if so, what those charges were.
What documentation do you maintain relating to arrests made by federal law enforcement at protests?
Please provide a list of each form of force and all equipment that DHS personnel have utilized in connection with these deployments, including but not limited to: tear gas, smoke, rubber bullets, pepper spray, and/or flash bangs. For each piece of equipment, please include the source.
How many complaints have been received by DHS, ICE, CBP, or FPS in connection with these deployments? How many complaints have been forwarded to the DHS Office of Inspector General? Please provide descriptions of the nature of each complaint, including whether the complaint involved an allegation of non-compliance with 8 C.F.R. § 287.8, which requires DHS immigration officers to identify themselves as “an immigration officer who is authorized to execute an arrest” and “[s]tate that the person is under arrest and the reason for the arrest.” 
How has DHS, ICE, CBP, and FPS responded to the complaints?
Have DHS, ICE, CBP, or FPS conducted investigations into the public reports of federal law enforcement officers’ conduct, including but not limited to the reports discussed above?  Please provide any documentation relating to such investigations along with their current statuses.
How many federal law enforcement agents are currently deployed in response to protests?  Please provide a breakdown by component and subdivision within DHS, including but not limited to CBP, BORTAC, ICE, HSI, and FPS, as well as their locations and dates of deployment.
For each component or subdivision, please provide the specific authority under which the component or subdivision is acting and a description of how these deployments advance the component or subdivision’s core mission. 
For each component or subdivision, please include any statutory authorities that DHS would attempt to invoke in connection with the deployments.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Print

Nationwide Enforcement Encounters: Title 8 Enforcement Actions and Title 42 Expulsions Fiscal Year 2021
On March 21, 2020 the President, in accordance with Title 42 of the United States Code Section 265, determined that by reason of existence of COVID-19 in Mexico and Canada, there is a serious danger of the further introduction of COVID-19 into the United States; that prohibition on the introduction of persons or property, in whole or in part, from Mexico and Canada is required in the interest of public health. Under this order, CBP is prohibiting the entry of certain persons who potentially pose a health risk, either by virtue of being subject to previously announced travel restrictions or because they unlawfully entered the country to bypass health screening measures. To help prevent the introduction of COVID-19 into border facilities and into the United States, persons subject to the order will not be held in congregate areas for processing and instead will immediately be expelled to their country of last transit. In the event a person cannot be returned to the country of last transit, CBP works with interagency partners to secure expulsion to the person’s country of origin and hold the person for the shortest time possible. This order does not apply to persons who should be excepted based on considerations of law enforcement, officer and public safety, humanitarian, or public health interests. Expulsions under Title 42 are not based on immigration status and are tracked separately from immigration enforcement actions, such as apprehension or inadmissibility, that are regularly reported by CBP.

Booker, Menendez, Colleagues Call on DHS to Halt Immigration Enforcement at Hospitals and Medical Facilities as Nation Braces for Coronavirus Outbreak
Threat of Deportation May Discourage Undocumented Immigrants from Seeking Medical Care for COVID-19
MARCH 05, 2020
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez (both D-N.J.), along with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) today urged the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to suspend all immigration enforcement actions in and around hospitals and other medical facilities as the nation prepares for potential outbreaks of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The lawmakers specifically called on the agencies to publicly announce this suspension to ensure that individuals who might otherwise refrain from seeking care due to fear of immigration enforcement are encouraged to seek treatment for COVID-19.
 DHS has previously acted to ensure that individuals—including undocumented individuals who might otherwise refrain from accessing medical care due to fears of deportation or other adverse immigration enforcement actions—can access health care and other services in the midst of public emergencies, and has done so following hurricanes, tropical storms, and other emergencies.
 In their letter, the lawmakers warned that immigration enforcement actions—when conducted in or around hospitals or other medical facilities—could discourage undocumented immigrants from seeking necessary medical care, rendering efforts to contain the virus more difficult.
 “As public health officials work to contain the spread of COVID-19, it would be extremely damaging to the nation’s public health efforts if individuals who may be suffering from the virus fear seeking medical help,” wrote the Senators to Acting Secretary Wolf, Acting Commissioner Morgan, and Deputy Director Albence. “To ensure that federal, state, and local public health responses to coronavirus are as robust and unhindered as possible, we urge your agencies to take a step similar to those they have taken during recent natural disasters and immediately announce the suspension of all immigration enforcement activities taking place in and around hospitals.”
 The Senators also asked DHS, CBP, and ICE to expand this suspension to include other medical facilities, such as clinics and urgent care facilities, and to include hospitals and other medical facilities within 100 miles of the international border in the list of facilities where the suspension is in place. In addition, the lawmakers requested a briefing on additional efforts underway at DHS and CBP to ensure that the agencies’ activities supplement and do not interfere with the response to COVID-19.
 Sens. Menendez and Booker have urged the Trump Administration to fully fund pandemic preparedness and response efforts in light of the global Coronavirus outbreak and are pushing to pass the $8 billion emergency fund package voted by the House of Representatives this week. Earlier today, the Senators announced the awarding of $1,750,000 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reimburse the State of New Jersey’s Department of Health (NJDOH) for its response and preparedness efforts to combat COVID-19.
 The full text of the letter can be found here and below.
 Dear Acting Secretary Wolf, Acting Commissioner Morgan, and Deputy Director Albence,
 As the nation prepares for an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we write to urge the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically U.S. Customers and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to suspend all immigration enforcement actions in and around hospitals and other medical facilities. In addition, we ask that DHS, specifically CBP and ICE, publicly announce this suspension to ensure that individuals who might otherwise refrain from seeking care due to fear of immigration enforcement are encouraged to seek treatment for COVID-19. Such a suspension has precedent in similar actions taken by DHS, ICE and CBP following hurricanes, tropical storms, and other public emergencies.
 DHS has traditionally taken steps to ensure that individuals—including undocumented individuals who might otherwise refrain from accessing medical care due to fears of deportation or other adverse immigration enforcement actions—can access health care and other services in the midst of public emergencies. In July 2019, for example, ICE chose to “temporarily suspend its routine targeted immigration enforcement activities” in parts of Louisiana and Mississippi impacted by Tropical Storm Barry.[1] ICE took a similar approach in 2017, during and after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and in 2018, during and after Hurricane Florence.[2] In August 2019, as Hurricane Dorian approached Florida, ICE also publicly reiterated that the agency “does not conduct immigration enforcement operations at hurricane evacuation sites or shelters,” stating that “a crisis such as the devastation and destruction caused by a hurricane is not time to compound on tragedy upon another by spreading fear in our community”—an acknowledgement that ICE operations can engender fear and have a chilling effect on a community.[3]
 A coronavirus pandemic also poses significant risks to the American public. In December, Chinese officials began reporting a novel virus originating in Wuhan, China. Researchers soon identified the virus as a new coronavirus strain (which causes COVID-19).[4] To date, the virus has infected nearly 90,000 people and killed over 3,000.[5] On January 30th, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a global health emergency,[6] and on January 31st, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar declared it a U.S. public health emergency.[7] Studies suggest that COVID-19 presents as a mild illness in the vast majority of people who contract it.[8] COVID-19, however, is highly transmissible, meaning that individuals with mild cases, if they do not seek treatment, run the risk of passing the virus on to other individuals who may experience more severe infections.[9] If individuals do not seek treatment for COVID-19 when they suspect they are infected, it renders containment efforts more difficult.[10]
 Immigration enforcement actions, when they take place in or around hospitals or other medical facilities, could discourage undocumented immigrants from seeking necessary medical care.[11] Under existing DHS and CBP policies, immigration enforcement actions—including “apprehensions, arrests, interviews, or searches, and for purposes of immigration enforcement only, surveillance”[12]—that are “at or focused on sensitive locations such as schools, places of worship, and hospitals should generally be avoided,” except under “limited circumstances.”[13] Under these policies, enforcement actions at sensitive locations like hospitals should only occur under “exigent circumstances, if other law enforcement actions have led officers to a sensitive location, or with prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official.”[14] Notably, this restriction on enforcement actions at sensitive locations does not apply to locations “within the immediate vicinity of the international border”—though officers operating within 100 miles of the border are “expected to exercise sound judgement and common sense while taking appropriate action, consistent with the goals of [CBP and DHS] policy.”[15]
 Recent reports, however, suggest that the agencies’ “sensitive locations” policy is inconsistently enforced.[16] Furthermore, medical providers across the country are seeing an uptick in “the presence of immigration authorities…at health care facilities.”[17] Doctors worry that this trend “could undermine public health in cities with large immigration populations” by “frightening patients” and “prompting them to avoid hospitals.”[18] As public health officials work to contain the spread of COVID-19, it would be extremely damaging to the nation’s public health efforts if individuals who may be suffering from the virus fear seeking medical help.
 To ensure that federal, state, and local public health responses to coronavirus are as robust and unhindered as possible, we urge your agencies to take a step similar to those they have taken during recent natural disasters and immediately announce the suspension of all immigration enforcement activities taking place in and around hospitals.  We also ask that you expand this suspension to include other medical facilities, such as clinics and urgent care facilities, and to include hospitals and other medical facilities within 100 miles of the international border in the list of facilities where the suspension is in place. We urge you to publicize this suspension to ensure that individuals who may be dissuaded from seeking care due to fears of immigration enforcement actions are instead able to seek COVID-19 testing and treatment. In addition, we request a staff-level briefing on additional efforts underway at DHS and CBP to ensure that the agencies’ activities supplement and do not interfere with the response to COVID-19.
 Sincerely,
  ###

About Foreign-Trade Zones and Contact Info
An Introduction to Foreign-Trade Zones
Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) are secure areas under U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) supervision that are generally considered outside CBP territory upon activation. Located in or near CBP ports of entry, they are the United States' version of what are known internationally as free-trade zones.
Authority for establishing these facilities is granted by the Foreign-Trade Zones Board under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u). The Foreign-Trade Zones Act is administered through two sets of regulations, the FTZ Regulations (15 CFR Part 400) and CBP Regulations (19 CFR Part 146).
Foreign and domestic merchandise may be moved into zones for operations, not otherwise prohibited by law, including storage, exhibition, assembly, manufacturing, and processing. All zone activity is subject to public interest review. Foreign-trade zone sites are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States as well as those of the states and communities in which they are located.
Under zone procedures, the usual formal CBP entry procedures and payments of duties are not required on the foreign merchandise unless and until it enters CBP territory for domestic consumption, at which point the importer generally has the choice of paying duties at the rate of either the original foreign materials or the finished product. Domestic goods moved into the zone for export may be considered exported upon admission to the zone for purposes of excise tax rebates and drawback.
Qualified public or private corporations that may operate the facilities themselves or contract for the operation sponsors foreign-trade zones. The operations are conducted on a public utility basis, with published rates. A typical general-purpose zone provides leasable storage/distribution space to users in general warehouse-type buildings with access to various modes of transportation. Many zone projects include an industrial park site with lots on which zone users can construct their own facilities.
Subzones are normally private plant sites authorized by the Board and sponsored by a grantee for operations that usually cannot be accommodated within an existing general-purpose zone.
The Advantages of Using a Foreign-Trade Zone
CBP duty and federal excise tax, if applicable, are paid when the merchandise is transferred from the zone for consumption.
While in the zone, merchandise is not subject to U.S. duty or excise tax. Certain tangible personal property is generally exempt from state and local ad valorem taxes.
Goods may be exported from the zone free of duty and excise tax.
CBP security requirements provide protection against theft.
Merchandise may remain in a zone indefinitely, whether or not subject to duty.
The rate of duty and tax on the merchandise admitted to a zone may change as a result of operations conducted within the zone. Therefore, the zone user who plans to enter the merchandise for consumption to CBP territory may normally elect to pay either the duty rate applicable on the foreign material placed in the zone or the duty rate applicable on the finished article transferred from the zone whichever is to his advantage.
Merchandise imported under bond may be admitted to a FTZ for the purpose of satisfying a legal requirement of exporting the merchandise. For instance, merchandise may be admitted into a zone to satisfy any exportation requirement of the Tariff Act of 1930, or an exportation requirement of any other Federal law (and many state laws) insofar as the agency charged with its enforcement deems it so.
Establishing a Foreign-Trade Zone
The Foreign-Trade Zones Act of 1934 created a Foreign-Trade Zones Board to review and approve applications to establish, operate, and maintain foreign-trade zones. The Board may approve any zone or subzone which it deems necessary to serve adequately ""the public interest"".
The Board also regulates the administration of foreign-trade zones and the rates charged by zone ""grantees"".
CBP must approve activation of the zone before any merchandise is admitted under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act.
It is the intent of the U.S. foreign-trade zone program to stimulate economic growth and development in the United States. In an expanding global marketplace there is increased competition among nations for jobs, industry and capital. The FTZ program was designed to promote American competitiveness by encouraging companies to maintain and expand their operations in the United States.
The FTZ program encourages U.S.-based operations by removing certain disincentives associated with manufacturing in the United States. The duty on a product manufactured abroad and imported into the U.S. is assessed on the finished product rather than on its individual parts, materials, or components. The U.S. based manufacturer finds itself at a disadvantage compared with its foreign competitor when it must pay a higher rate on parts, materials, or components imported for use in a manufacturing process. The FTZ program corrects this imbalance by treating products made in the zone, for the purpose of tariff assessment, as if it were manufactured abroad. At the same time, this country benefits because the zone manufacturer uses U.S. labor, services, and inputs.
Role of CBP
CBP is responsible for the transfer of merchandise into and out of the FTZ and for matters involving the collection of revenue. The Office of Regulations and Rulings at CBP Headquarters provides legal interpretations of the applicable statute, CBP Regulations and procedures.
The Port Director of CBP, in whose port a zone is located, is charged with overseeing zone activity as the local representative of the Foreign-Trade Zones Board. He or she controls the admission of merchandise into the zone, the handling and disposition of merchandise in the zone, and the removal of merchandise from the zone. In addition to the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, he or she enforces all laws normally enforced by CBP that are relevant to foreign-trade zones.
Zones are supervised by FTZ Coordinators (i.e., CBP Officers, Import Specialists, Entry Specialists or Agricultural Specialists, etc.) through compliance reviews and visits; the security of the zone must meet certain requirements.
What may be placed in zones
Any foreign or domestic merchandise not prohibited by law or other exception listed below, whether dutiable or not, may be taken into a foreign-trade zone.
Merchandise, which lawfully cannot be imported into the United States, is prohibited without exception. Furthermore, placing merchandise subject to a quota into a zone cannot circumvent quota on the imported merchandise.
On the other hand, merchandise for which a quota is filled or for which a quota on entry is established, may be placed into a zone until the quota opens or is removed since foreign-trade zones are considered outside CBP territory for entry purposes. Such products, with the exception of certain textiles (19 CFR 146.63(d)), may be manipulated or manufactured while in the zone into a product not subject to quota.
Some Federal agencies regulate storage and handling in the United States of certain types of merchandise, such as explosives. Depending on the nature of the requirements and the particular characteristics of the zone facility, such merchandise may be excluded. Moreover, agencies, which license importers or issue importation permits may block admissions to a zone, which are not properly licensed or permitted.
The Foreign-Trade Zones Board may exclude from a zone any merchandise that is in its judgment detrimental to the public interest, health, or safety. The Board may place restrictions on certain types of merchandise, which would limit the zone status allowed, the kind of operation on the merchandise in a zone, the entry of the merchandise into the commerce, or similar transactions or activities.
What may be done in zones
The Foreign-Trade Zones Board may exclude from a zone any merchandise that is in its judgment detrimental to the public interest, health, or safety. The Board may place restrictions on certain types of merchandise, which would limit the zone status allowed, the kind of operation on the merchandise in a zone, the entry of the merchandise into the commerce, or similar transactions or activities.
Many products subject to an internal revenue tax may not be manufactured in a zone. These products include alcoholic beverages, products containing alcoholic beverages except domestic denatures distilled spirits, perfumes containing alcohol, tobacco products, firearms, and sugar. In addition, the manufacture of clock and watch movements is not permitted in a zone.
No retail trade of foreign merchandise may be conducted in a FTZ. However, foreign and domestic merchandise may be stored, examined, sampled, and exhibited in a zone.
Entering merchandise from a zone into the United States for consumption
The entry, classification, and appraisement of merchandise transferred from a foreign-trade zone is affected by the ""status"" of the merchandise.
Privileged foreign status
Prior to any manipulation or manufacture, which would change its tariff classification, an importer may apply to the Port Director to have imported merchandise in the zone given privileged foreign status. The merchandise is classified and appraised and duties and taxes are determined as of the date the application is filed. When such merchandise is transferred from the zone for U.S. consumption, either in its original state or after manipulation or manufacture the applicable duties and taxes would be paid based on the rate established when privileged foreign status was granted.
Zone restricted status
Merchandise transferred to a zone from CBP territory for storage or for the purpose of satisfying a legal requirement for exportation or destruction is considered exported and cannot be returned to CBP territory for consumption unless the Foreign-Trade Zones Board rules that it's return is in the public interest. The status of merchandise transferred to a zone under these circumstances is ""zone restricted."" Zone restricted merchandise may not be manipulated, except to destroy it, or manufactured in a zone. As in the case of privileged foreign status, the zone user must apply for zone restricted status on the appropriate CBP form.
Nonprivileged foreign status
Merchandise composed entirely of or derived entirely of nonprivileged merchandise are appraised and classified in its condition at the time of transfer into CBP territory for consumption or for CBP bonded warehousing. Waste recovered from privileged foreign merchandise is assigned NPF status. Domestic merchandise, which has lost its identity, will be assigned NPF status. NPF may be changed to PF prior to manipulation or manufacture.
Domestic status
Domestic status, which may be approved upon application to the Port Director, is available for merchandise which is (a) the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States on which all internal revenue taxes, if applicable, have been paid, (b) previously imported merchandise on which all internal revenue taxes have been paid, or (c) merchandise previously admitted free of duty. Domestic merchandise may be admitted to a zone without a CBP permit, and also removed from a zone without a CBP permit if it has not been combined with any other merchandise of any other status.

DHS/CBP/PIA–024 Arrival and Departure Information System
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) consolidates data from a variety of systems to create a unique person-centric record with complete travel history. Originally, CBP created ADIS to identify individuals who had overstayed their class of admission (“visa overstays”); however, due to ADIS’s unique abilities to conduct biographic matching, data-tagging, and filtering, CBP is broadening its use of ADIS for all traveler encounters regardless of citizenship. CBP is republishing this Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to provide notice, and assess the privacy risks, of expanding ADIS beyond its original visa overstay mission. As the primary CBP system used to determine person-centric travel history and immigration status, ADIS supports a variety of non-law enforcement use cases that often require U.S. citizen travel history. CBP is reissuing this PIA to document the expanded uses of ADIS and its maintenance of all CBP travel records, including those of U.S. citizens. January 2020

As January marks the 20th anniversary of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, CBP serves as frontline defense against human trafficking and forced labor.

Airport. Photo by Glenn Fawcett
It’s a problem of epic proportions but many times hides in plain sight. Worldwide, the United Nations estimates more than 40.3 million adults and children are enslaved through human
trafficking and forced labor at any given time, with the slave laborers exploited by the private sector in other countries to do domestic work, construction or agriculture. About 4.8 million are victims of the commercial sex industry, many times young women and minors. It’s something U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer Lisa Caselli saw firsthand.
During an encounter with a young Russian woman who was trying to enter the U.S., Caselli questioned her about why she was coming into America, how she obtained her visa, and what she would be doing in this country. While not evasive, Caselli found the woman’s answers vague and not making sense, tipping off the CBP officer to a possible crime.
“She wasn’t trying to get over on me; she genuinely believed she was coming as a model. But based on what she presented to me and what she was saying, I believed she was a victim of human trafficking,” Caselli said of the encounter more than a dozen years ago. “I said to her, ‘I believe that tonight you’ll be in a brothel, and you’ll be a prostitute.’”
The woman was shocked, but Caselli told her it didn’t appear to be a real job with a genuine modeling agency. The young woman was sent back to Russia, because at the time, CBP had no mechanism in place to deal with human trafficking. But that has changed. Caselli is a program manager in CBP who works with airline carriers to identify human trafficking victims and get them to the right law enforcement authorities, as well as non-profit groups who can help. “Now we refer them to non-government services and people [in the U.S. government, including Homeland Security Investigations] to help with trafficking victims.”
With more than 42,000 CBP officers and Border Patrol agents along the nearly 7,000 miles of land border and 328 ports of entry, the agency is uniquely positioned to deter and disrupt human trafficking. Those on the border and the ports of entry are many times the first law enforcement officers victims might encounter. Through an online course and mentoring from senior officers and agents in the field, CBP trains all its frontline law enforcement personnel to recognize the signs of human trafficking and the immediate actions necessary to protect the innocent. The first step is identifying victims.
Looking for the Signs
CBP officers and Border Patrol agents are trained to look for several signs of possible human trafficking. A victim:
Lacks control of identification documents or travel documents
Lacks freedom of movement
Shows signs of having been abused or physically assaulted. Such signs range from the more obvious, such as broken bones, to the more subtle, such as branding or tattooing
Seems submissive or fearful in the presence of others

provides a variety of materials to help officials and the
public recognize the signs of human trafficking.

Beyond these signs, Caselli said officers and agents are taught how to ask the right questions.
“When we do interviews, we are trained to ask the questions, listen to the answers, and follow up with more questions,” she said. “You have to make sure you’re listening to what they’re saying.”
For example, a CBP officer might ask if someone has ever been arrested, the entrant answers, “Yes,” and the officer moves on to the next question, “Why are you coming to the U.S.” Caselli said they’re taught to make sure they listen to that yes answer and follow up with when and why the person was arrested. “Don’t just get into the zone; you have to listen to the answers and follow up on what they said,” she said.

available in languages other than English.

Furthermore, CBP officers and Border Patrol agents are taught to look for telltale signs: children coming off a long, tiring flight being too well-behaved while waiting in line, how people are interacting with each other – especially if someone is acting too shy or submissive, as well one person not letting the others speak and controlling the travel documents. But Caselli said they also recognize other cultures might not conform to the American standard, or the lead person in the group might be the only one who speaks English well enough. She said screening a passenger is a very fine art of looking for subtleties.
“You have to take into consideration where the person is coming from, what the family dynamic is,” adding in some male-dominated cultures, the husband might be the only one who speaks or even makes eye contact with the officer or agent. “That doesn’t indicate there’s trafficking going on; it’s cultural. You can’t make a blanket assumption for everybody.”
Blue Lightning Initiative
While CBP trains its men and women to recognize the signs and intervene, the agency also enlists the aid of more sets of eyes outside of CBP. Through the Blue Lightning Initiative, CBP, its parent organization – the Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Department of Transportation train airline workers what to look for and how to report suspected human trafficking. So far, more than two dozen airlines and more than 100,000 workers in the aviation industry have been trained. It’s just a short, 17-minute training video, but Caselli said, once they know what to watch for, these workers recognize the indicators of human trafficking and know how to be proactive and report it to the Homeland Security Investigations tip line.
“Airline personnel know their jobs, so if you just direct them what to look for, they will recognize the signs,” she said, adding another key point they teach airline workers is never to confront the victim or trafficker; instead they are taught to call the tip line’s director of field operations for the Houston area.
Officials also pointed out that human trafficking is the second largest criminal enterprise in the world – just behind drug smuggling, generating an estimated $31.6 billion in profits to criminal organizations that use the money to fund other crimes and possibly terrorist actions. “There are myths that human trafficking doesn’t happen in the United States, but that’s not true; it happens in every country,” Caselli said. Eventually, many victims of human trafficking are exploited as slaves and coerced into forced labor around the globe.
Slave/Forced Labor
The United Nation’s International Labour Organization estimates that about 25 million people are trapped in forced labor worldwide, producing dozens of items ranging from cotton to gold (see the recent Frontline article, “CBP Takes Aim at Forced Labor”). Sixteen million victims find themselves working in private sector industries such as mining, agriculture, and construction, while 4 million work directly for state authorities. Others, like the young woman Caselli suspected, may be sold in the commercial sex trade.
In order to prevent and disrupt the importation of products generated by forced labor, CBP created the Forced Labor Division within the Office of Trade to enforce the law outlined by the Trade Facilitation and Enforcement Act of 2015 – better known as TFTEA – which amended rules regarding imports produced by forced labor.  CBP analysts in the Forced Labor Division accept allegations of forced labor from a variety of sources, review and investigate those allegations, and, if the evidence supports it, pursue enforcement actions to prevent the importation of such goods.
“CBP is firmly committed to identifying and preventing products made with the use of forced labor from entering the stream of U.S. commerce,” said Brenda Smith, Executive Assistant Commissioner, CBP Office of Trade. “Our agency works tirelessly behind the scenes to investigate and gather information on forced labor in global supply chains.”
When information reasonably but not conclusively indicates that the merchandise being imported was produced using forced labor, CBP’s commissioner may issue a withhold release order, allowing CBP to detain the goods. Once the order is in place, importers have the opportunity either to re-export the detained shipments at any time, or to submit information to CBP demonstrating that the goods are not in violation of the law. However, the goods in question may not enter the country at any point until the importer sufficiently demonstrates that they were not produced by forced labor.
Since the enactment of TFTEA, CBP has issued 13 withhold release orders covering various countries and products suspected of forced labor violations, seven of which were issued in 2019. Most recently, CBP issued orders covering clothing from a company in Xinjiang, China; disposable rubber gloves from a company in Malaysia; gold mined in artisanal small mines in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo; rough diamonds from the Marange diamond fields in Zimbabwe; bone black manufactured in Brazil; and tobacco products from Malawi.

“We want to send a message that we’re holding our business community to a standard of not using forced labor in their supply chains, and that companies must know their entire supply chain,” Smith said. Ultimately, CBP’s goal is to protect the victims of human smuggling and human trafficking by sending the message that the United States will not support the practice of forced labor in the manufacturing of U.S. goods.
A Crime Against the Person
Many people confuse human smuggling with human trafficking. But Caselli said while some people are smuggled in for the purposes of being trafficked later on, the real key is what or who is victimized.
“Smuggling is a crime against the border, but trafficking is a crime against the person,” she said. While smugglers often treat their people as just cargo designed to be dropped off and forgotten, traffickers want to make sure their victims arrive with no issues preventing them from entering the country.
While Caselli wishes she could have done more for the young Russian woman years ago, she’s glad all CBP officers and Border Patrol agents have more tools to help them prevent this crime.
“We are getting better at recognizing the signs of human trafficking and reporting has increased,” she said, adding human trafficking is a preventable crime, and CBP is key in stopping it. “The victims are often afraid to seek help because of threats from the trafficker. It’s only after the agent or officer builds a relationship with the person that the victim will admit they are being threatened.”
U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between official ports of entry. CBP is charged with securing the borders of the United States while enforcing hundreds of laws and facilitating lawful trade and travel.

As January marks the 20th anniversary of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, CBP serves as frontline defense against human trafficking and forced labor.

It’s a problem of epic proportions but many times hides in plain sight. Worldwide, the United Nations estimates more than 40.3 million adults and children are enslaved through human
trafficking and forced labor at any given time, with the slave laborers exploited by the private sector in other countries to do domestic work, construction or agriculture. About 4.8 million are victims of the commercial sex industry, many times young women and minors. It’s something U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer Lisa Caselli saw firsthand.

Border Crisis: CBP Fights Child Exploitation
Without a choice, thousands of children are forced to make a perilous journey

It’s a situation Border Patrol Agent Hermann Rivera faced far too often: an adult illegal alien approaching him with a child in tow, seeking asylum in the United States.
“He initially stated that the child was his kid,” Rivera said. But after carefully checking his documents and pressing the issue, the man admitted the truth. “’I’m not sure whose child this is,’” Rivera said the man told Border Patrol agents when he finally revealed the truth.

It’s something that has happened thousands of times in the past year. In fact, Border Patrol agents identified more than 6,200 fraudulent family members in fiscal year 2019, which runs from Oct. 1, 2018 through Sept. 30, 2019. This is at a time when Border Patrol agents apprehended over 473,000 people who presented themselves as a family unit.
The reason so many are making the perilous journey through Mexico with a child – whether it’s a fraudulent family or a biological parent or legal guardian – is obvious: many before them were allowed to stay in the United States despite their illegal entry across the border. In the recent past, CBP could hold most families just a few days before releasing them into the U.S. or transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who by a 2015 court order had to release families into the United States within 20 days. The result was that these families were able to remain in the U.S. – often indefinitely.
During a news conference Oct. 29, in El Paso, Texas, Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan explained the role of transnational criminal organizations in driving the surge in illegal migration. “[Illegal aliens] were coached and mentored and given what to say by the cartels and the human smuggling organizations: You grab a kid, and that is your U.S. passport,” said Morgan. “That will guarantee you entry into the United States. And guess what, they were right.”
But at the end of September, the Department of Homeland Security launched a series of initiatives to effectively enforce the law and instill integrity into the immigration system. The government of Mexico also ramped up immigration enforcement efforts along their borders and smuggling corridors.
That led Acting Commissioner Morgan to announce “We have essentially ended catch and release along the Southwest Border,” during the news conference in El Paso.
“Mass releases of processed, non-criminal families into the U.S. was the only option we had to keep up with last year’s record apprehension levels,” said Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol Carla Provost. “We know smuggling organizations tried to exploit this to use children as a commodity to facilitate their release into the U.S. Now, with the tools we have in place to stop the release of families, we are removing the incentive to exploit children in this way.”

 When “catch-and-release” was still in effect, transnational criminal organizations found a new way to profit from smuggling and exploiting immigrants, and that money funded – and continues to fund – other illicit activities, such as drug smuggling into the United States, Acting Commissioner Morgan said during the Oct. 29 news conference. “We’re closing the loopholes that are driving these individuals to turn their lives over to the cartels to be abused and be treated as nothing more than a commodity, diminishing the smugglers’ abilities to make billions of dollars on [illegal aliens’] backs. The message that is going out now, for the first time in a long time: If you grab a kid, it’s NOT an automatic passport into the United States.”
The new demographic of families and unaccompanied children posed new challenges for the Border Patrol, as its facilities were built to process adult males from Mexico – historically the predominant demographic apprehended crossing the Southwest border. These single, adult males were easier to process and quickly returned to Mexico.
Caught in between are the children being exploited – by strangers and their own families.
“The children don’t have any say if they want to come or not. The parents are using that child as their ticket,” said Rivera, a parent himself. He also pointed to how families risk their children’s lives either by bringing those kids with them or by “renting” a child to a stranger who travels thousands of miles on a dangerous journey just to improve that person’s chances of being released into the U.S. “Why would anybody put their child at risk to do that?”
Rivera said the first thing Border Patrol agents do when encountering illegal aliens – especially children – is check on their physical condition: Do they need water? Are they hungry? Do they need medical help? Most of all, they make sure people in custody are treated with dignity and respect. “We treat them the way we want to be treated,” he said.
Between 120 and 150 migrants were apprehended in the timespan of about an hour after they crossed the Rio Grande in Los Ebanos, west of McAllen, Texas.

 After making sure their immediate needs are met, illegal aliens – including the families with children – are transported to a border station: a processing center of sorts, where families are held typically for 72 hours or less before they are handed off to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or, as is the case now, sent back to Mexico. During that time of custody, CBP maintains a high level of care, especially for the children in their charge, and ensures actual family members are identified.

“We’re trained to find those fake family units because that child could be trafficked,” said Border Patrol Intelligence Agent Edward Delgado, one of the many people who work at the central processing center in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley trying to root out the fraudulent claims. “[The child] could be recycled to some other adult in Central America or alien smuggling organizations using them for some other means just to get more money out of [that child].”
He said careful observations are part of what agents use to determine if a child actually belongs to an adult.
“Each of us goes into the holding areas of the family units, and we look at their documents, the children’s demeanor and interaction with the [alleged parents], and we look for fathers with young infants – 5 or 6 months old,” Delgado said. He added Border Patrol agents work closely with their Homeland Security Investigations colleagues to evaluate the families, including any documents they present as proof of the parent-child relationship.
If someone is caught with a fraudulent document, others coming from the same village or community are more closely scrutinized since it’s often a racket perpetrated at the source. In May, at the height of the apprehensions, Border Patrol agents caught an average of 285 fraudulent families each week. They’re continuing to catch the fraudulent families, even though the numbers are down due to overall apprehensions being lower right now. “We still continue to find these fraudulent documents and fake family units.”     
Delgado himself saw several times children being “rented out” to help illegal aliens try to game the system.
“The parents are poor, and a stranger offers to pay them $1,000 to use their child, that parent is going to go for that incentive,” Delgado said. “You have a child’s life in a stranger’s hands.”
He reiterated the scrutiny is to protect the U.S., as well as the exploited children.
“We’re here to determine who the real biological parent is,” he said. “We’re trying to take care of that child.”

cross border activity. Photo by CBP Officer

Furthermore, CBP is committed to the health and safety of the children in its custody. Henry Moak is CBP’s Chief Accountability Officer and Juvenile Coordinator. He conducts both announced and unannounced inspections at the holding facilities CBP maintains along the Southwest border to monitor compliance with the Flores Settlement Agreement. That 25-year-old agreement established a nationwide policy for the detention, release, and treatment of minors in CBP and ICE custody. During the past year, Moak inspected the facilities and conducted more than 60 voluntary interviews with adults and children to ensure appropriate treatment consistent with the terms of the agreement. Overall, Moak believes CBP continues to use all available resources to ensure the agency substantially complies with the agreement.
Moak said CBP continues to strike a balance between its law enforcement mission and its humanitarian commitment, considering how officers and agents face this huge influx of illegal aliens and the unique challenges caring for families, especially small children, brought. “CBP has done miraculous work, knowing the flow [of illegal immigrants] changed so dramatically this year,” he said.
Moak pointed out a conversation he had with an agent at one Border Patrol station with a large number of families and unaccompanied children and how that large number of families forced them to take agents off patrol. Border Patrol officials said 40-60% of staff have been dedicated to humanitarian efforts.
Delgado emphasized, that despite being pulled in different directions, all agents have the children’s best interests at heart.
“We’re all fathers. We’re not mistreating children,” he said. “I see agents comforting kids. We try to comfort them as a father would,” adding when they see a sick child, they immediately take that child to get medical care.
Rivera said if potential migrants think they have a legitimate asylum claim, they should consider all legal options before they leave their home country. Bringing a child on a dangerous journey through Central America and Mexico only exposes them to hardships and suffering.
“These children are vulnerable; they’re actually the ones who need the help,” Rivera said. “They’re brought against their will, and they have no say in where they’re going, whether it’s mom or dad, aunt or uncle, or some stranger getting something out of it.”

It’s a situation Border Patrol Agent Hermann Rivera faced far too often: an adult illegal alien approaching him with a child in tow, seeking asylum in the United States.
“He initially stated that the child was his kid,” Rivera said. But after carefully checking his documents and pressing the issue, the man admitted the truth. “’I’m not sure whose child this is,’” Rivera said the man told Border Patrol agents when he finally revealed the truth.

It’s something that has happened thousands of times in the past year. In fact, Border Patrol agents identified more than 6,200 fraudulent family members in fiscal year 2019, which runs from Oct. 1, 2018 through Sept. 30, 2019. This is at a time when Border Patrol agents apprehended over 473,000 people who presented themselves as a family unit.
The reason so many are making the perilous journey through Mexico with a child – whether it’s a fraudulent family or a biological parent or legal guardian – is obvious: many before them were allowed to stay in the United States despite their illegal entry across the border. In the recent past, CBP could hold most families just a few days before releasing them into the U.S. or transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who by a 2015 court order had to release families into the United States within 20 days. The result was that these families were able to remain in the U.S. – often indefinitely.
During a news conference Oct. 29, in El Paso, Texas, Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan explained the role of transnational criminal organizations in driving the surge in illegal migration. “[Illegal aliens] were coached and mentored and given what to say by the cartels and the human smuggling organizations: You grab a kid, and that is your U.S. passport,” said Morgan. “That will guarantee you entry into the United States. And guess what, they were right.”
But at the end of September, the Department of Homeland Security launched a series of initiatives to effectively enforce the law and instill integrity into the immigration system. The government of Mexico also ramped up immigration enforcement efforts along their borders and smuggling corridors.
That led Acting Commissioner Morgan to announce “We have essentially ended catch and release along the Southwest Border,” during the news conference in El Paso.
“Mass releases of processed, non-criminal families into the U.S. was the only option we had to keep up with last year’s record apprehension levels,” said Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol Carla Provost. “We know smuggling organizations tried to exploit this to use children as a commodity to facilitate their release into the U.S. Now, with the tools we have in place to stop the release of families, we are removing the incentive to exploit children in this way.”

 When “catch-and-release” was still in effect, transnational criminal organizations found a new way to profit from smuggling and exploiting immigrants, and that money funded – and continues to fund – other illicit activities, such as drug smuggling into the United States, Acting Commissioner Morgan said during the Oct. 29 news conference. “We’re closing the loopholes that are driving these individuals to turn their lives over to the cartels to be abused and be treated as nothing more than a commodity, diminishing the smugglers’ abilities to make billions of dollars on [illegal aliens’] backs. The message that is going out now, for the first time in a long time: If you grab a kid, it’s NOT an automatic passport into the United States.”
The new demographic of families and unaccompanied children posed new challenges for the Border Patrol, as its facilities were built to process adult males from Mexico – historically the predominant demographic apprehended crossing the Southwest border. These single, adult males were easier to process and quickly returned to Mexico.
Caught in between are the children being exploited – by strangers and their own families.
“The children don’t have any say if they want to come or not. The parents are using that child as their ticket,” said Rivera, a parent himself. He also pointed to how families risk their children’s lives either by bringing those kids with them or by “renting” a child to a stranger who travels thousands of miles on a dangerous journey just to improve that person’s chances of being released into the U.S. “Why would anybody put their child at risk to do that?”
Rivera said the first thing Border Patrol agents do when encountering illegal aliens – especially children – is check on their physical condition: Do they need water? Are they hungry? Do they need medical help? Most of all, they make sure people in custody are treated with dignity and respect. “We treat them the way we want to be treated,” he said.
Between 120 and 150 migrants were apprehended in the timespan of about an hour after they crossed the Rio Grande in Los Ebanos, west of McAllen, Texas. Smugglers guide the migrants across the river from Mexico in rafts that hold from 10 to 20 people. Once across, they are apprehended by Border Patrol agents who start processing them in the field and then transport them to a processing center. Photo by Mani Albrecht
 After making sure their immediate needs are met, illegal aliens – including the families with children – are transported to a border station: a processing center of sorts, where families are held typically for 72 hours or less before they are handed off to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or, as is the case now, sent back to Mexico. During that time of custody, CBP maintains a high level of care, especially for the children in their charge, and ensures actual family members are identified.

“We’re trained to find those fake family units because that child could be trafficked,” said Border Patrol Intelligence Agent Edward Delgado, one of the many people who work at the central processing center in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley trying to root out the fraudulent claims. “[The child] could be recycled to some other adult in Central America or alien smuggling organizations using them for some other means just to get more money out of [that child].”
He said careful observations are part of what agents use to determine if a child actually belongs to an adult.
“Each of us goes into the holding areas of the family units, and we look at their documents, the children’s demeanor and interaction with the [alleged parents], and we look for fathers with young infants – 5 or 6 months old,” Delgado said. He added Border Patrol agents work closely with their Homeland Security Investigations colleagues to evaluate the families, including any documents they present as proof of the parent-child relationship.
If someone is caught with a fraudulent document, others coming from the same village or community are more closely scrutinized since it’s often a racket perpetrated at the source. In May, at the height of the apprehensions, Border Patrol agents caught an average of 285 fraudulent families each week. They’re continuing to catch the fraudulent families, even though the numbers are down due to overall apprehensions being lower right now. “We still continue to find these fraudulent documents and fake family units.”     
Delgado himself saw several times children being “rented out” to help illegal aliens try to game the system.
“The parents are poor, and a stranger offers to pay them $1,000 to use their child, that parent is going to go for that incentive,” Delgado said. “You have a child’s life in a stranger’s hands.”
He reiterated the scrutiny is to protect the U.S., as well as the exploited children.
“We’re here to determine who the real biological parent is,” he said. “We’re trying to take care of that child.”

Furthermore, CBP is committed to the health and safety of the children in its custody. Henry Moak is CBP’s Chief Accountability Officer and Juvenile Coordinator. He conducts both announced and unannounced inspections at the holding facilities CBP maintains along the Southwest border to monitor compliance with the Flores Settlement Agreement. That 25-year-old agreement established a nationwide policy for the detention, release, and treatment of minors in CBP and ICE custody. During the past year, Moak inspected the facilities and conducted more than 60 voluntary interviews with adults and children to ensure appropriate treatment consistent with the terms of the agreement. Overall, Moak believes CBP continues to use all available resources to ensure the agency substantially complies with the agreement.
Moak said CBP continues to strike a balance between its law enforcement mission and its humanitarian commitment, considering how officers and agents face this huge influx of illegal aliens and the unique challenges caring for families, especially small children, brought. “CBP has done miraculous work, knowing the flow [of illegal immigrants] changed so dramatically this year,” he said.
Moak pointed out a conversation he had with an agent at one Border Patrol station with a large number of families and unaccompanied children and how that large number of families forced them to take agents off patrol. Border Patrol officials said 40-60% of staff have been dedicated to humanitarian efforts.
Delgado emphasized, that despite being pulled in different directions, all agents have the children’s best interests at heart.
“We’re all fathers. We’re not mistreating children,” he said. “I see agents comforting kids. We try to comfort them as a father would,” adding when they see a sick child, they immediately take that child to get medical care.
Rivera said if potential migrants think they have a legitimate asylum claim, they should consider all legal options before they leave their home country. Bringing a child on a dangerous journey through Central America and Mexico only exposes them to hardships and suffering.
“These children are vulnerable; they’re actually the ones who need the help,” Rivera said. “They’re brought against their will, and they have no say in where they’re going, whether it’s mom or dad, aunt or uncle, or some stranger getting something out of it.”

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently completed an investigation into the death of a Guatemalan child who died in U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) custody.  
The investigation found no misconduct or malfeasance by DHS personnel:
•    On December 6, 2018, a 7-year-old child and her father were apprehended in Antelope Wells, New Mexico.  

•    On December 7, 2018, during transport from Antelope Wells to another USBP facility 90 miles away in Lordsburg, New Mexico, the child’s father reported that she was ill with a fever and vomiting.  The child also started having seizures.  

•    When the child arrived at the USBP station in Lordsburg, USBP Emergency Medical Technicians initiated medical care and flew the child to the hospital by commercial air ambulance.  

•    USBP personnel drove the father to the hospital.

•    The child was pronounced dead at the hospital the next day. 

•    OIG conducted a detailed investigation and coordinated with the local medical examiner’s office.  

•    The state medical examiner’s autopsy report found the child died of natural causes due to sequelae of Streptococcal sepsis.

DOJ and DHS OIGs Release a Joint Review of Law Enforcement Cooperation on the Southwest Border between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations

Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz and Department Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari announced today the release of a joint review examining law enforcement cooperation on the Southwest border between DOJ’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).  The FBI and HSI share many of the same statutory authorities to investigate certain crimes, underscoring the need for agents to share information and manage investigative overlap effectively.
The Offices of Inspector General (OIGs) found that the majority (63%) of FBI and HSI Southwest border agents did not encounter cooperation failures, and agents reported that task forces improved cooperation and allowed for increased collaboration between the FBI and HSI.  However, of the 37% of agents who did experience cooperation failures, 87% reported at least one negative impact as a result, such as loss of trust, unnecessarily prolonged investigations, and failure to gather evidence or apprehend a target. 

The report identified several factors that may have contributed to these cooperation failures, including:
• The FBI and HSI had inconsistent practices, lacked specific policies, and many agents were unaware of requirements related to deconfliction. In February 2019, ICE issued an agency-specific deconfliction policy that may result in improvements.
• Many agents did not understand the other agency’s mission and authorities and did not trust the other agency or its personnel. 
• DOJ and DHS do not have a memorandum of understanding related to cooperation on the Southwest border. 

The DOJ OIG and DHS OIG made five recommendations to the FBI and HSI to address these cooperation challenges.  The FBI agreed with all five recommendations.  HSI agreed with three of the recommendations and did not concur with two of them.

Today’s report is available:
• On the DOJ OIG website: https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2019/e1903.pdf
• On the DHS OIG website: https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-08/OIG-19-57-Jul19.pdf

Travel
Civil Enforcement
Prohibited Items
Planning ahead and packing properly can facilitate the screening process and ease your travel experience at the airport. Know what you can pack before arriving at the airport by checking the prohibited items list. Carrying prohibited items may cause delays for you and other travelers, but they may also lead to fines and sometimes even arrest.
Passengers may transport unloaded firearms in checked baggage if they are transported in a locked, hard-sided container and declared to the airline before traveling. Consistent with the new ATF definition of firearm, TSA now considers frames, receivers, and 3D printed guns to be firearms under its civil enforcement program. These items remain prohibited items and must be transported in accordance with TSA regulations in a passenger's checked bag. In addition, TSA considers a firearm to be ""loaded"" when both the firearm and its ammunition are accessible to the passenger. For example, if an individual has a firearm in accessible baggage and ammunition in his/her pocket, or any combination where the individual has access to both, the firearm is considered ""loaded"" for purposes of assessing a civil penalty. Read the requirements for transporting firearms and ammunition. In addition, local and state governments, and other countries, may have their own rules on firearm possession or transportation. As a result, prohibited items may result in both a TSA civil enforcement action and a criminal enforcement action.
Before leaving home, remember to check your baggage to ensure you are not carrying any prohibited items to avoid a possible arrest and/or civil penalties.
Enforcement Sanctions Guidance
Individuals/Travelers
TSA may impose civil penalties of up to $14,950 per violation per person. This table outlines some of the penalties that may be imposed on individuals for prohibited items violations and violations of other TSA regulations. Repeat violations will result in higher penalties. See the TSA Enforcement Sanctions Guidance Policy for a more detailed list of the penalty guidelines.
Security Violations by Individuals for Prohibited Items Discovered at Checkpoint/Sterile Area/Onboard Aircraft
Security Violations for Prohibited Items Discovered in Checked Baggage
Other Security Violations by Individuals or Persons
Action Plan Program
Read the Action Plan Program for eligible parties and TSA to discuss and reach an agreement on corrective actions to address the root cause of any security vulnerability or noncompliance with TSA security requirements that qualify for this program, and resolve that vulnerability or noncompliance with administrative action instead of a civil enforcement action. This program became effective on August 26, 2019.

The Coast Guard manages six major operational mission programs:
Maritime Law Enforcement: The Maritime Law Enforcement mission program protects America's maritime borders, defends the Nation's maritime sovereignty, facilitates legitimate use of the waterways, and suppresses violations of U.S. Federal law on, under, and over the seas to include illegal migration and Transnational Organized Crime.
        Maritime Response: The Maritime Response mission program seeks to mitigate the consequences of marine casualties and disastrous events. The Coast Guard is the Nation’s premiere maritime first responder, minimizing loss of life and property by searching for and rescuing persons in distress. The Coast Guard is capable of rapidly mobilizing resources to provide an immediate and reliable response to maritime incidents in coordination with, and in support of, Federal, State, local, territorial, and tribal agencies, as well as private sector partners.
    Maritime Prevention: The Maritime Prevention mission program seeks to prevent marine casualties and property losses, minimize security risks, and protect the marine environment. The Coast Guard does so by developing and enforcing federal regulations, conducting safety and security inspections, and analyzing port security risk assessments.
        Marine Transportation System Management: The Marine Transportation System Management mission program seeks to ensure a safe, secure, and environmentally sound waterways system. The Coast Guard works in concert with other Federal, State, local, tribal and territorial agencies, the marine industry, maritime associations, and the international community to safeguard the efficient and economical movement of $5.4 trillion in overall economic activity flowing through the Nation’s ports and waterways.
      Maritime Security Operations: The Maritime Security Operations mission program encompasses activities to detect, deter, prevent, and disrupt terrorist attacks, and other criminal acts in the U.S. maritime domain. It includes the execution of antiterrorism, response, and select recovery operations. This mission performs the operational element of the Coast Guard's Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security mission and complements our Maritime Response and Prevention efforts.
      Defense Operations: The Defense Operations mission program exercises the Coast Guard's unique authorities and capabilities to support the National Defense Strategy. Every day, Coast Guard is deployed around the globe in support of Combatant Commanders to protect the security of our Nation far from U.S. soil.
      The operational mission programs oversee 11 Missions codified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. That act delineates the 11 missions as “homeland security” or “non-homeland security” missions.

Examining Public Information Campaigns as a Strategy of Border Enforcement
An NSF grant will help a University of Arizona researcher analyze public information campaigns as a strategy of border enforcement, comparing case studies from the United States and Australia.
By Lori Harwood, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences
Oct. 14, 2019

Managing the transnational flow of people is one of the greatest challenges facing countries, requiring governments to negotiate complex issues of sovereignty, national security, and human safety and well-being.
Public information campaigns, or PICs, present a potentially promising approach to regulating transnational mobility, as they are often less expensive and easier to implement than traditional enforcement strategies. However, little is known about the use of PICs as a strategy of border enforcement.
Jill Williams, associate research professor in the University of Arizona Southwest Institute for Research on Women in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, received a grant from the National Science Foundation to examine these issues. She is collaborating with co-principal investigator Kate Coddington, assistant professor in the Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Albany, SUNY.  
The researchers will compare case studies in the United States and Australia to explore how specific cultural, economic, political and geographic contexts affect the development and implementation of PICs as a mechanism of border enforcement. Research methods include textual analysis, interviews and geo-visualization techniques that combine quantitative and qualitative data.
""United States and Australian border enforcement agencies have spent millions of dollars over the last 15 years on public information campaigns aimed at discouraging unauthorized migration, but very little research has examined these campaigns and their impact,"" said Williams, who is also an assistant research social scientist in the School of Geography and Development and the director of the Women in Science and Engineering Program.
The research will provide insight on the best practices for effectively mobilizing PICs as an enforcement strategy. The findings will have implications for national security, ensuring that border enforcement efforts are effective, economically efficient and safe.
""This project will be an important step towards understanding how PICs function within the larger context of border enforcement and provide information necessary for policy makers interested in developing effective and humane border enforcement policies,"" Williams said.
The dissemination plan, including a publicly available website, will enable public engagement and provide easily accessible information for migration research and education.
""We are particularly excited to compile the data we collect into interactive and publicly available 'StoryMaps' so that the research findings are easily understandable and accessible to the general public,"" Williams said.

Examining Public Information Campaigns as a Strategy of Border Enforcement
An NSF grant will help a University of Arizona researcher analyze public information campaigns as a strategy of border enforcement, comparing case studies from the United States and Australia.
By Lori Harwood, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences
Oct. 14, 2019

Managing the transnational flow of people is one of the greatest challenges facing countries, requiring governments to negotiate complex issues of sovereignty, national security, and human safety and well-being.
Public information campaigns, or PICs, present a potentially promising approach to regulating transnational mobility, as they are often less expensive and easier to implement than traditional enforcement strategies. However, little is known about the use of PICs as a strategy of border enforcement.
Jill Williams, associate research professor in the University of Arizona Southwest Institute for Research on Women in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, received a grant from the National Science Foundation to examine these issues. She is collaborating with co-principal investigator Kate Coddington, assistant professor in the Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Albany, SUNY.  
The researchers will compare case studies in the United States and Australia to explore how specific cultural, economic, political and geographic contexts affect the development and implementation of PICs as a mechanism of border enforcement. Research methods include textual analysis, interviews and geo-visualization techniques that combine quantitative and qualitative data.
""United States and Australian border enforcement agencies have spent millions of dollars over the last 15 years on public information campaigns aimed at discouraging unauthorized migration, but very little research has examined these campaigns and their impact,"" said Williams, who is also an assistant research social scientist in the School of Geography and Development and the director of the Women in Science and Engineering Program.
The research will provide insight on the best practices for effectively mobilizing PICs as an enforcement strategy. The findings will have implications for national security, ensuring that border enforcement efforts are effective, economically efficient and safe.
""This project will be an important step towards understanding how PICs function within the larger context of border enforcement and provide information necessary for policy makers interested in developing effective and humane border enforcement policies,"" Williams said.
The dissemination plan, including a publicly available website, will enable public engagement and provide easily accessible information for migration research and education.
""We are particularly excited to compile the data we collect into interactive and publicly available 'StoryMaps' so that the research findings are easily understandable and accessible to the general public,"" Williams said.

CBP has the critical responsibility to enforce U.S. trade laws prior to merchandise arriving at U.S. ports of entry, once merchandise arrives at our ports, and even after merchandise is released into the U.S. marketplace. Among other critical mission sets, CBP is charged with balancing the facilitation of legitimate trade that supports economic growth with the duty to shield the American public and businesses from unsafe products, intellectual property theft, and unfair trade practices.
To enforce trade laws effectively and minimize the unnecessary slowing of trade, CBP leverages its expertise to identify the highest-risk imports prior to release. In the post-release environment, CBP utilizes a sophisticated system of reviews and audits to verify import compliance and accurate revenue collection. CBP expertly applies an increasing number of complex U.S. and international trade laws and when CBP detects a discrepancy, actions are taken to address the violation and deter future non-compliance.
To accomplish comprehensive, agile, and uniform enforcement, CBP employs a national trade enforcement program that offers a framework for national collaboration within CBP and among other government agencies and multinational partners.
The below data is only a snapshot of CBP's critical trade mission. It summarizes CBP's revenue collection efforts; implementation of the recent trade remedies taken pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and Sections 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974; and trade enforcement actions.

DHS/ICE/PIA-015 Enforcement Integrated Database
The Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shared common database repository used by several DHS law enforcement and homeland security applications. EID stores and maintains information related to the investigation, arrest, booking, detention, and removal of persons encountered during immigration and criminal law enforcement investigations and operations conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), all components within DHS. The Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for EID was first published in January 2010. Since its publication, the PIA has been updated several times to reflect the expansion of information stored in EID, the types of information shared with external parties, and an enhanced electronic sharing capability. This PIA update is being conducted to address certain applications that use EID data for the identification of individuals encountered and/or arrested by ICE. This PIA update will discuss how the DHS Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) uses the EID Arrest Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Law Enforcement (EAGLE); introduce the EAGLE Directed Identification Environment (EDDIE); and introduce the Digital Application for Victim Witness Identification (DAVID). ICE is publishing this PIA because EAGLE, EDDIE, and DAVID all process personally identifiable information (PII) about ICE investigation subjects and/or individuals subject to removal from the United States.

ICYMI: Democrats Dismiss Efforts to Protect Children, Uphold Rule of Law, Protect Law Enforcement
Homeland Democrats Ram Through Hyper-Partisan Border Bill, Reject Republican Amendments  
WASHINGTON – Today, the House Homeland Security Committee advanced H.R. 2203, which would undermine border security, endanger children, threaten our communities and do nothing to address the root cause of the border crisis.
Committee Republican made efforts to improve the bill, but committee Democrats rejected them all.
Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) offered an amendment that would have provided greater protections to migrant children from human smugglers. Every single Democrat on the committee rejected it.
“My amendment…would strike section 205, a provision [that]…prohibits trained federal law enforcement officers from saving migrant children from the clutches of dangerous human smugglers or individuals who have been convicted of violent or sexual crimes,” Ms. Lesko said. “There’s an example as recently as May of this year where DHS law enforcement officers caught a Honduran man trying to enter the country with an unrelated, wasn’t his children, 6-month-old infant. They arrested man and placed the infant in the care of HHS, thankfully. But under this bill…that 6-month-old infant would have remained in the custody of the human smuggler because under this section [law enforcement is] prohibited from removing the child.” 
Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) offered an amendment to restore rule of law to H.R. 2203. It would strike a provision requiring all migrants from being released into U.S. communities after 72 hours of arrest, would allow the administration to continue its efforts to fix our broken asylum process, and eliminate a provision designed to shut down border and immigration operations. Every single Democrat on the committee rejected it.
“My amendment strikes some of the bill’s most egregious attacks on the rule of law,” Higgins said. “It would remove the catch and release provision that releases all illegal immigrants into the interior of our country within 72 hours of arrest. Remote stations and large migrant groups mean that it can take days to move them to ICE or HHS facilities. Mandating a 72-hour limit on our border officers is an open invitation to cartels and smugglers stating that there are no real consequences for illegal entry into the United States…”
Higgins continued, “My amendment would also remove…restrictions on President Trump’s Migrant Protection Protocols and recognize the recently announced asylum reforms. These protocols are designed to address dangerous overcrowding at ports and patrol stations by working with Mexican officials to have asylum seeks wait in Mexico for an appointment with a CBP officer… the underlying bill includes a provision that requires federal, state, and local law enforcement officers to comply with a dozen new administrative requirements for every single routine traffic stop or encounter…My amendment would strike this provision, which is designed to pull agents away from their primary mission and overburden or even shut down border and immigration enforcement operations.”
Rep. John Joyce (R-Pa.) offered an amendment to eliminate a partisan commission stacked with Democrats to “investigate” President Trump’s handling of the border crisis. Every single Democrat on the committee rejected it.
“Title I of the Escobar bill establishes a partisan commission stacked with Democrat lawmakers to ‘investigate’ President Trump’s handling of the border crisis,” Joyce said. “Establishing a partisan commission to further harass this administration is not in the best interest in assembling a bipartisan consensus that will be necessary to deal with this issue. Some of the major problems with the structure set out in this bill are: six of the ten members are Democrats, with the chairman appointed by Speaker Pelosi; commissioners are not required to have the any border security or law enforcement experience; [and] it authorizes a baseline of $3 million to carry out prescribed functions, and six-figure salaries for the staff of the commission. This commission will only look at the last two years rather than go back to when the crisis truly started under President Obama with the unaccompanied minor crisis of 2014.”
Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) offered an amendment to protect Customs and Border Protection officers from H.R. 2203’s new mandates that assume the worst of law enforcement. Every single Democrat on the committee rejected it.
“This bill’s array of new mandates are designed to second guess officers and insert open-border activists into the law enforcement process,” Green said. “Activists whose unintended consequences will be more people in harm’s way. My amendment replaces these errors with common-sense operations procedures, preventing any of these accidents from occurring. For example, striking the bill’s extra-judicial and unconstitutional Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is designed to investigate complaints made by illegal immigrants against officers and unilaterally provide whatever remedies the office deems appropriate. This could include adjustment of immigration status or monetary damages. Such changes could be made through proper authorities, but doing so through a singular unelected bureaucrat with no accountability sets up a system that gives an executive branch office the ability to undo our legislative branch actions”
Bottom line: Speaker Pelosi is rushing open border bills to the floor to appease the radical left in her caucus and vilify the president for his efforts to enforce our immigration laws. Instead of wasting time on political exercises that have no chance of becoming law, House Democrats should work across the aisle on bipartisan solutions that actually address the root causes of the border crisis.

Countering Terrorism
Terrorist groups such as ISIS, al-Qa’ida, and Hizballah continue to plot attacks against the United States and our allies and partners. As the threats posed by these organizations continue to evolve, the Department of State works to build global consensus to degrade and defeat these adversaries.  Through a combination of diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance, the Department works with foreign government partners to build the capabilities necessary to prevent, degrade, detect, and respond to terrorist threats.  This includes efforts to strengthen law enforcement and judicial capabilities, expand aviation and border security, deepen global information sharing, counter terrorist financing, improve crisis response, and counter violent extremism.  Through its global engagement, the State Department promotes greater burden sharing to address terrorist threats and encourages countries to build counterterrorism capacity in their own regions.  The State Department also works closely with the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, Treasury, and the Intelligence Community to lead an integrated whole-of-government approach to international counterterrorism.

Bringing Food into the U.S.
Many agriculture products are prohibited entry into the United States from certain countries because they may carry plant pests and foreign animal diseases.  All agriculture items must be declared and are subject to inspection by a CBP Agriculture Specialist at ports of entry to ensure they are free of plant pests and foreign animal diseases. Prohibited or restricted items may include meats, fresh fruits and vegetables, plants, seeds, soil and products made from animal or plant materials.  For generally allowed food items please visit USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
Declared agriculture items, in non-commercial quantities, that are found to be prohibited or restricted by the CBP Agriculture Specialists can be abandoned at the port of entry should the traveler wish to continue into the U.S. However, undeclared prohibited agriculture items will be confiscated and can result in the issuance of a civil penalty to the traveler for failure to declare the prohibited item. All agricultural items that are abandoned or confiscated at ports of entry are destroyed in accordance with USDA approved destruction methods to prevent spread of pests and diseases.
Agricultural pests and diseases are a threat to U.S. crop production and to the livestock industry. Some animal diseases can be highly contagious and could cause severe economic damage to livestock and result in losses in production, which could lead to increased costs for meat and dairy products. Plant pests and disease, as well as invasive plant material can cause crop loss and also damage lawns, ornamental plants, and trees.  Plant pest infestations can result in increased costs to consumers due to pest eradication efforts as well as lower crop yields.  High risk plant pest and animal disease outbreaks within the U.S. could also adversely affect the economy as a result of reduced trade of U.S. origin goods to countries around the world.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security are partners in the effort to protect American agriculture against the introduction of pests and diseases at our nation's ports of entry. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service determines what agricultural products are admissible into the U.S. and what products pose a risk and should be prohibited or restricted entry. U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforce these agricultural rules and regulations at ports of entry. Learn more about protecting agriculture.

Bringing Food into the U.S.
Many agriculture products are prohibited entry into the United States from certain countries because they may carry plant pests and foreign animal diseases.  All agriculture items must be declared and are subject to inspection by a CBP Agriculture Specialist at ports of entry to ensure they are free of plant pests and foreign animal diseases. Prohibited or restricted items may include meats, fresh fruits and vegetables, plants, seeds, soil and products made from animal or plant materials.  For generally allowed food items please visit USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
Declared agriculture items, in non-commercial quantities, that are found to be prohibited or restricted by the CBP Agriculture Specialists can be abandoned at the port of entry should the traveler wish to continue into the U.S. However, undeclared prohibited agriculture items will be confiscated and can result in the issuance of a civil penalty to the traveler for failure to declare the prohibited item. All agricultural items that are abandoned or confiscated at ports of entry are destroyed in accordance with USDA approved destruction methods to prevent spread of pests and diseases.
Agricultural pests and diseases are a threat to U.S. crop production and to the livestock industry. Some animal diseases can be highly contagious and could cause severe economic damage to livestock and result in losses in production, which could lead to increased costs for meat and dairy products. Plant pests and disease, as well as invasive plant material can cause crop loss and also damage lawns, ornamental plants, and trees.  Plant pest infestations can result in increased costs to consumers due to pest eradication efforts as well as lower crop yields.  High risk plant pest and animal disease outbreaks within the U.S. could also adversely affect the economy as a result of reduced trade of U.S. origin goods to countries around the world.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security are partners in the effort to protect American agriculture against the introduction of pests and diseases at our nation's ports of entry. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service determines what agricultural products are admissible into the U.S. and what products pose a risk and should be prohibited or restricted entry.

DHS/TSA/PIA-018 TSA Secure Flight Program
The purpose of the Secure Flight program is to screen individuals before they access airport sterile areas or board aircraft. This screening is designed to identify known or suspected terrorists or other individuals who may be a threat to transportation or national security, to prevent some identified individuals from gaining access to airports and airplanes where they may jeopardize the lives of passengers, and to ensure that other identified individuals receive enhanced physical screening prior to accessing airport sterile areas or boarding an aircraft. Secure Flight performs watch list matching on carrier-provided traveler information to the No Fly and Selectee portions of the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), as well as other watch lists to identify individuals who may need additional screening or are prevented from travel.

“We have implemented an unprecedented action that will address the urgent humanitarian and security crisis at the Southern border. This humanitarian approach will help to end the exploitation of our generous immigration laws. The Migrant Protection Protocols represent a methodical commonsense approach, exercising long-standing statutory authority to help address the crisis at our Southern border.” – Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen M. Nielsen
What Are the Migrant Protection Protocols?
The Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) are a U.S. Government action whereby certain foreign individuals entering or seeking admission to the U.S. from Mexico – illegally or without proper documentation – may be returned to Mexico and wait outside of the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings, where Mexico will provide them with all appropriate humanitarian protections for the duration of their stay. 
Why is DHS Instituting MPP?
The U.S. is facing a security and humanitarian crisis on the Southern border. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using all appropriate resources and authorities to address the crisis and execute our missions to secure the borders, enforce immigration and customs laws, facilitate legal trade and travel, counter traffickers, smugglers and transnational criminal organizations, and interdict drugs and illegal contraband.  
MPP will help restore a safe and orderly immigration process, decrease the number of those taking advantage of the immigration system, and the ability of smugglers and traffickers to prey on vulnerable populations, and reduce threats to life, national security, and public safety, while ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the protections they need.
Historically, illegal aliens to the U.S. were predominantly single adult males from Mexico who were generally removed within 48 hours if they had no legal right to stay; now over 60% are family units and unaccompanied children and 60% are non-Mexican. In FY17, CBP apprehended 94,285 family units from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador (Northern Triangle) at the Southern border. Of those, 99% remain in the country today.
Misguided court decisions and outdated laws have made it easier for illegal aliens to enter and remain in the U.S. if they are adults who arrive with children, unaccompanied alien children, or individuals who fraudulently claim asylum. As a result, DHS continues to see huge numbers of illegal migrants and a dramatic shift in the demographics of aliens traveling to the border, both in terms of nationality and type of aliens- from a demographic who could be quickly removed when they had no legal right to stay to one that cannot be detained and timely removed.
In October, November, and December of 2018, DHS encountered an average of 2,000 illegal and inadmissible aliens a day at the Southern border. While not an all-time high in terms of overall numbers, record increases in particular types of migrants, such as family units, travelling to the border who require significantly more resources to detain and remove (when our courts and laws even allow that), have overwhelmed the U.S. immigration system, leading to a “system” that enables smugglers and traffickers to flourish and often leaves aliens in limbo for years. This has been a prime  cause of our near-800,000 case backlog in immigration courts and delivers no consequences to aliens who have entered illegally.
Smugglers and traffickers are also using outdated laws to entice migrants to undertake the dangerous journey north where on the route migrants report high rates of abuse, violence, and sexual assault. Human smugglers and traffickers exploit migrants and seek to turn human misery into profit. Transnational criminal organizations and gangs are also deliberately exploiting the situation to bring drugs, violence, and illicit goods into American communities.  The activities of these smugglers, traffickers, gangs and criminals endanger the security of the U.S., as well as partner nations in the region.
The situation has had severe impacts on U.S. border security and immigration operations.  The dramatic increase in illegal migration, including unprecedented number of families and fraudulent asylum claims is making it harder for the U.S. to devote appropriate resources to individuals who are legitimately fleeing persecution. In fact, approximately 9 out of 10 asylum claims from Northern Triangle countries are ultimately found non-meritorious by federal immigration judges. Because of the court backlog and the impact of outdated laws and misguided court decisions, many of these individuals have disappeared into the country before a judge denies their claim and simply become fugitives.
The MPP will provide a safer and more orderly process that will discourage individuals from attempting illegal entry and making false claims to stay in the U.S., and allow more resources to be dedicated to individuals who legitimately qualify for asylum.
What Gives DHS the Authority to Implement MPP?
Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) addresses the inspection of aliens seeking to be admitted into the U.S. and provides specific procedures regarding the treatment of those not clearly entitled to admission, including those who apply for asylum.  Section 235(b)(2)(C) provides that “in the case of an alien  . . . who is arriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival) from a foreign territory contiguous to the U.S.,” the Secretary of Homeland Security “may return the alien to that territory pending a [removal] proceeding under § 240” of the INA.”  The U.S. has notified the Government of Mexico that it is implementing these procedures under U.S. law.
Who is Subject to MPP?
With certain exceptions, MPP applies to aliens arriving in the U.S. on land from Mexico (including those apprehended along the border) who are not clearly admissible and who are placed in removal proceedings under INA § 240.  This includes aliens who claim a fear of return to Mexico at any point during apprehension, processing, or such proceedings, but who have been assessed not to be more likely than not to face persecution or torture in Mexico.  Unaccompanied alien children and aliens in expedited removal proceedings will not be subject to MPP.  Other individuals from vulnerable populations may be excluded on a case-by-case basis.
How Will MPP Work Operationally?
Certain aliens attempting to enter the U.S. illegally or without documentation, including those who claim asylum, will no longer be released into the country, where they often fail to file an asylum application and/or disappear before an immigration judge can determine the merits of any claim.  Instead, these aliens will be given a “Notice to Appear” for their immigration court hearing and will be returned to Mexico until their hearing date.
While aliens await their hearings in Mexico, the Mexican government has made its own determination to provide such individuals the ability to stay in Mexico, under applicable protection based on the type of status given to them.  
Aliens who need to return to the U.S. to attend their immigration court hearings will be allowed to enter and attend those hearings.  Aliens whose claims are found meritorious by an immigration judge will be allowed to remain in the U.S.  Those determined to be without valid claims will be removed from the U.S. to their country of nationality or citizenship.
DHS is working closely with the U.S. Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review to streamline the process and conclude removal proceedings as expeditiously as possible.
Will Migrants in MPP Have Access to Counsel?
Consistent with the law, aliens in removal proceedings can use counsel of their choosing at no expense to the U.S. Government.  Aliens subject to MPP will be afforded the same right and provided with a list of legal services providers in the area which offer services at little or no expense to the migrant. 
What Are the Anticipated Benefits of MPP?
Every month, tens of thousands of individuals arrive unlawfully at the Southern Border.  MPP will reduce the number of aliens taking advantage of U.S. law and discourage false asylum claims.  Aliens will not be permitted to disappear into the U.S. before a court issues a final decision on whether they will be admitted and provided protection under U.S. law.  Instead, they will await a determination in Mexico and receive appropriate humanitarian protections there.  This will allow DHS to more effectively assist legitimate asylum-seekers and individuals fleeing persecution, as migrants with non-meritorious or even fraudulent claims will no longer have an incentive for making the journey.  Moreover, MPP will reduce the extraordinary strain on our border security and immigration system, freeing up personnel and resources to better protect our sovereignty and the rule of law by restoring integrity to the American immigration system.

DHS Releases Southwest Border Enforcement Statistics
Release Date: January 9, 2019
Today, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the number of enforcement actions at the southwest border for the month of December.  Due to the lapse in funding, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is unable to publish the enforcement actions for December on its website.
Total Enforcement Actions (individuals apprehended in between the ports of entry and deemed inadmissible at the ports of entry) for the month of December in Fiscal Year 2019 was 60,782. December marks the third consecutive month of enforcement actions surpassing 60,000.
The United States Border Patrol apprehended 50,753 individuals (83.5% of all enforcement actions) between the ports of entry on the southern border. The total number of individuals deemed inadmissible for entry at the ports of entry was 10,029.
Key statistics:

In Fiscal Year 2017, CBP averaged 13,210 family units and unaccompanied alien children each month – in Fiscal Year 2019 CBP is now averaging 31,188 a month. That is a 136% increase.
The total number of FMUAs apprehended in between the ports of entry was 27,518. December was a record-breaking month for FMUAs apprehended at the border.
FMUA apprehensions through December total 75,794 – higher than 5 out of the last 7 years FY totals – exceeding all but FY16 and FY18, but currently tracking 253% higher than FY16 and 280% higher than FY18 for the same time frames.
Of FMUA apprehensions in December, 95% are from Northern Triangle. 96% for the first quarter.
For the first quarter, 77% of family units are from Guatemala and Honduras alone.
This month marks the third time FMUA apprehensions exceeded Single Adult apprehensions.
Apprehensions from Guatemala exceeded Mexico for the third consecutive month (only happened four times) and Honduras has exceeded Mexico for the second consecutive month.
The total number of unaccompanied children apprehended in between the ports of entry and deemed inadmissible at the ports of entry: 5,121
Total number of unaccompanied children apprehended in between the ports of entry: 4,766
Total number of unaccompanied children deemed inadmissible at the ports of entry: 355

ALABAMA LAW ENFORCEMENT HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY HOMELAND SECURITY
The Alabama Homeland Security Office works with federal, state and local partners to prevent, protect and respond to acts of terrorism in the State of Alabama.  Since the attacks of 9/11, our nation as we knew it changed forever.  This office is committed to protecting the citizens of Alabama by supporting local first responders and private sector partners.   
Reporting Suspicious Activity
A vigilant and aware public is paramount to the safety of Alabama.  Alabama is a partner in the US Department of Homeland Security’s ‘If you see something, say something” campaign.  This is a national campaign that raises public awareness and promotes the importance of reporting suspicious activity to state and local law enforcement.
Suspicious activity is any observed behavior that could indicate terrorism or terrorism-related crime. This includes, but is not limited to: 
Unusual items or situations: A vehicle is parked in an odd location, a package/luggage is unattended, a window/door is open that is usually closed, or other out-of-the-ordinary situations occur.
Eliciting information: A person questions individuals at a level beyond curiosity about a building’s purpose, operations, security procedures and/or personnel, shift changes, etc.
Observation/surveillance: Someone pays unusual attention to facilities or buildings beyond a casual or professional interest. This includes extended loitering without explanation (particularly in concealed locations); unusual, repeated, and/or prolonged observation of a building (e.g., with binoculars or video camera); taking notes or measurements; counting paces; sketching floor plans, etc.
If you see something, say something!

REMARKS
Remarks by President Trump on the Illegal Immigration Crisis and Border Security
IMMIGRATION
Issued on: November 1, 2018
ALL NEWS
Roosevelt Room
4:19 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, everyone. Appreciate it. And good afternoon. I would like to provide an update to the American people regarding the crisis on our southern border — and crisis it is.
Illegal immigration affects the lives of all Americans. Illegal immigration hurts American workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety; and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most. Illegal immigration costs our country billions and billions of dollars each year.
America is a welcoming country. And under my leadership, it’s a welcoming country. We lead the world in humanitarian protection and assistance, by far. There’s nobody even close. We have the largest and most expansive immigration programs anywhere on the planet.
We’ve issued 40 million green cards since 1970, which means the permanent residency and a path to citizenship for many, many people. But we will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws, defy our rules, violate our borders, break into our country illegally. We won’t allow it.
Mass, uncontrolled immigration is especially unfair to the many wonderful, law-abiding immigrants already living here who followed the rules and waited their turn. Some have been waiting for many years. Some have been waiting for a long time. They’ve done everything perfectly. And they’re going to come in. At some point, they’re going to come in. In many cases, very soon. We need them to come in, because we have companies coming into our country; they need workers. But they have to come in on a merit basis, and they will come in on a merit basis.
The communities are often left to bear the cost and the influx of people that come in illegally. We can’t allow that.
There’s a limit to how many people a nation can responsibly absorb into their societies. Every day, above and beyond our existing lawful admission programs, roughly 1,500 to 2,000 people try crossing our borders illegally. We do a very good job considering the laws are so bad. They’re not archaic; they’re incompetent. It’s not that they’re old; they’re just bad. And we can’t get any Democrat votes to change them. It’s only the Republicans that are — in unison, they want to change them. They want to make strong borders, want to get rid of any crime because of the borders, of which there’s a lot.
And we’ve done a great job with the laws that we have. We’re moving in tremendous numbers of people to get out the MS-13 gangs and others gangs that illegally come into our country. And we’re getting them out by the thousands.
But this is a perilous situation, and it threatens to become even more hazardous as our economy gets better and better. A lot of the cause of this problem is the fact that we right now have the hottest economy anywhere in the world. It’s doing better than any economy in the world. Jobs, unemployment — you look at any number.
Right now, we have more workers than any time in the history of our country. We have more people working, which is a tremendous statement. More people working than at any time in the history of our country. And people want to come in, and in some cases, they want to take advantage of that, and that’s okay. And we want them to come in, but they have to come in through merit. They have to come in legally.
At this very moment, large, well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an “invasion.” It’s like an invasion. They have violently overrun the Mexican border. You saw that two days ago. These are tough people, in many cases. A lot of young men, strong men. And a lot of men that maybe we don’t want in our country. But again, we’ll find that out through the legal process.
But they’ve overrun the Mexican police, and they’ve overrun and hurt badly Mexican soldiers. So this isn’t an innocent group of people. It’s a large number of people that are tough. They’ve injured, they’ve attacked, and the Mexican police and military has actually suffered. And I appreciate what Mexico is trying to do.
So let me begin by stating that these illegal caravans will not be allowed into the United States, and they should turn back now, because they’re wasting their time. They should apply to come into our country. We want them to come into our country very much. We need people to help us, with all of these companies that are coming in. We’ve never had anything like this. We have car companies coming in. We have Foxconn — so involved with the manufacturing of Apple products — coming in in Wisconsin. We have a lot of companies coming in, but they have to apply, and they have to be wonderful people that are going to love our country and work hard.
And we’ve already dispatched, for the border, the United States military. And they will do the job. They are setting up right now, and they’re preparing. We hope nothing happens. But if it does, we are totally prepared. Greatest military anywhere in the world, and it’s going to be, and is now, in great shape. No longer depleted like it was when I took over as the President of the United States.
The government of Mexico has generously offered asylum, jobs, education, and medical care for people within the caravan, but many members of the caravan have refused these offers, which demonstrate that these migrants are not legitimate asylum-seekers. They’re not looking for protection. Because if they were, they’d be able to get it from Mexico. Mexico has agreed to take them in and encouraged them to stay. But they don’t want to stay; they want to come into the United States. So this is no longer safety, and asylum is about safety.
Asylum is not a program for those living in poverty. There are billions of people in the world living at the poverty level. The United States cannot possibly absorb them all. Asylum is a very special protection intended only for those fleeing government persecution based on race, religion, and other protected status.
These caravans and illegal migrants are drawn to our country by Democrat-backed laws and left-wing judicial rulings. We’re getting rulings that are so ridiculous, so bad. They’re writing the laws. Can’t do that. Collectively known as — as an example, catch-and-release. It’s a disgrace that we have to put up with it.
These policies lead to the release of illegal aliens into our communities after they’ve been apprehended. But we’re not releasing anymore. Big change, as of a couple of days ago. We’re going to no longer release. We’re going to catch; we’re not going to release. They’re going to stay with us until the deportation hearing or the asylum hearing takes place. So we’re not releasing them into the community.
We have millions of people that, over the years, have been released into the community. They never show up for the trials. They never come back. They’re never seen again. And those people, they know who they are. And we know a lot of where they are, who they are. And those people will be deported, directly deported.
The biggest loophole drawing illegal aliens to our borders is the use of fraudulent or meritless asylum claims to gain entry into our great country. An alien simply crosses the border illegally, finds a Border Patrol agent, and using well-coached language — by lawyers and others that stand there trying to get fees or whatever they can get — they’re given a phrase to read. They never heard of the phrase before. They don’t believe in the phrase. But they’re given a little legal statement to read, and they read it. And now, all of a sudden, they’re supposed to qualify. But that’s not the reason they’re here.
This merely asserts the need for asylum, and then often released into the United States, and they await a lengthy court process. The court process will takes years sometimes for them to attend. Well, we’re not releasing them into our country any longer. They’ll wait for long periods of time. We’re putting up massive cities of tents. The military is helping us incredibly well.
I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. They’ve been so efficient, so good, so talented. And we have thousands of tents. We have a lot of tents; we have a lot of everything. We’re going to hold them right there. We’re not letting them into our country. And then they never show up — almost. It’s like a level of 3 percent. They never show up for the trial. So by the time their trial comes, they’re gone. Nobody knows where they are. But we know where a lot of them are, and they’re going to be deported.
There are now nearly 700,000 aliens inside the United States awaiting adjudication of their claims. Most of these people we have no idea how they got there, why they got there. And the number is actually going to be a much larger number as we look at all of the data. So if you look at just at a minimal number, it’s the size of Vermont, or bigger. And the overall number could be 10 million people; it could be 12 million people; it could be 20 million people. The record keeping from past administrations has not exactly been very good.
As human smugglers and traffickers have learned how the game is played and how to game the system, we have witnessed a staggering 1,700 [percent] increase in asylum claims since the year 2010. They understand the law better than the lawyers understand the law. You have a lot of professionalism there. You have a lot of professionalism involved with setting up the caravans. You take a look at the way that’s happening. Even the countries — you look at Honduras and El Salvador, and you look at what’s happening at the different levels and different countries, and what’s happening on the streets. There’s a lot of professionalism taking place, and there seems to be a lot of money passing. And then, all of a sudden, out of the blue, these big caravans are formed and they start marching up. They got a long way to go.
On average, once released, an asylum case takes three and half years to complete. Think of it. Somebody walks into our country, reads a statement given by a lawyer, and we have a three-and-a-half-year court case for one person, whereas other people tell them, “Out. Get out. Just get out.” Other countries — “Get out. We have a border. Get out.”
We go through years and years of litigation because of the Democrats and the incompetent, very, very stupid laws that we have. They’re the laughingstock all over the world, including the people that are marching up. They understand. But the difference is, we’re not allowing them in, and we’re not releasing, and we’re not doing any of the things that were done for so many years that really are terrible for our country.
The overwhelming majority of claims are rejected by the courts, but by that time, the alien has usually long since disappeared into our country. So they never get to see the judge. They never get to have a ruling. They don’t care because they’re in the country and nobody knows where they are.
All told, there are approximately 1 million aliens who have received final orders of removal. They’ve actually got final orders of removal. You don’t have to go to court anymore. The courts have already issued the orders of removal, and we’ve gotten a lot of them. But who remain at large in our country. So we’ve moving them out.
This endemic abuse of the asylum system makes a mockery of our immigration system, displacing legitimate asylum-seekers — and there are legitimate asylum-seekers — while rewarding those who abuse or defraud our system, which is almost everybody. Everybody is abusing it and just doing things to our system which were unthinkable, I’m sure even by the Democrats who were largely responsible for getting it done.
These individuals disrespect the foundations of American government by voluntarily choosing to break the law as their first act on American soil.
Furthermore, contained within this giant flow of illegal migration to our southwest border is the movement of illicit and deadly narcotics. It’s in the southwest, most of it comes in. Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters through the southern border– think of that: 100 percent, almost, of heroin comes in through the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, and the majority of meth, and a substantial portion of the ultra-lethal fentanyl killing our youth. Fentanyl is killing our youth.
These drugs destroy the lives and kill much more than 70,000 Americans every single year. And the number goes up. It goes up and up and up, because we are so foolish with our laws that we allow this to happen. A death toll equivalent of the size of an entire American city every year.
The current influx, if not halted, threatens to overwhelm our immigration system and our communities, and poses unacceptable dangers to the entire nation. We have to have our borders. Can’t let drugs come in. Not just — it’s not just people. It’s people; it’s drugs. It’s human traffickers.
Human trafficking is now at the highest level in the world that it’s ever been. And that’s because of the Internet. Think of it — human trafficking. You think back 200 years, 500 years. Human trafficking — where they steal children; in many cases, women, unfortunately. They steal women. The human traffickers, the lowest scum on Earth. The lowest scum on Earth. And it’s at a level that it’s never been. Worldwide — never been at a level like this.
If these caravans are allowed into our country, only bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow. And you see that’s what’s happening now. We have one that’s coming up, and it’s being somewhat dissipated, as they march. But then other people are joining it. And then it gets bigger. And now, if you look back at Honduras, and if you look at El Salvador, other ones are solving and they’re forming. They’re forming. You have new ones that are forming. And we call it “caravan number two” is unbelievably rough people. Very, very hard for the military to stop it. Our military will have no problem. But very, very hard. Mexico is having a very, very hard time with it.
Once they arrive, the Democrat Party’s vision is to offer them free healthcare, free welfare, free education, and even the right to vote. You and the hardworking taxpayers of our country will be asked to pick up the entire tab. And that’s what’s happening — medical and, in many cases, they’ve got some big medical problems before they get here.
No nation can allow itself to be overwhelmed by uncontrolled masses of people rushing their border. That’s what’s happening. They are rushing our border. They are coming up. And even before you get to the caravan, just on a daily basis, people coming in. And it’s a very bad thing for our country. It’s sad in many ways, but it’s a very bad thing for our country. And again, costs us billions and billions and billions of dollars a year.
And I will therefore take every lawful action at my disposal to address this crisis. And that’s what we’re doing. The United States military, great people.
My administration is finalizing a plan to end the rampant abuse of our asylum system — it’s abused — to halt the dangerous influx, and to establish control over America’s sovereign borders. We got borders. And once that control is set and standardized, and made very strong — including the building of the wall, which we’ve already started. $1.6 billion spent last year; $1.6 billion this year. We have another $1.6 [billion] that will be coming, but we want to build it at one time. All it does is turn people in a different direction if you don’t. We want to build it at one time.
Under this plan, the illegal aliens will no longer get a free pass into our country by lodging meritless claims in seeking asylum. Instead, migrants seeking asylum will have to present themselves lawfully at a port of entry. So they’re going to have to lawfully present themselves at a port of entry. Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our country. We will hold them — for a long time, if necessary.
The only long-term solution to the crisis, and the only way to ensure the endurance of our nation as a sovereign country, is for Congress to overcome open borders obstruction. That’s exactly what it is: It’s open border obstruction. No votes. You can come up with the greatest border plan, the greatest immigration plan. You won’t get one vote from a Democrat. They have terrible policy. In many cases, they’re terrible politicians. But the one thing I give them great credit for: They vote as a bloc. They stick together.
And we will end catch-and-release. We’re not releasing any longer. We also must finish the job that we started by being strong at the border. When we’re strong at the border, people will turn away and they won’t bother. You will see, in a year from now, or in certainly a period of time from now, despite our very good economy, which some of them come for that — I can’t blame them for that; you have to do it legally — but you will see that the numbers of people trying to get in will be greatly reduced.
But that can only happen if we’re strong at the border. And the southern border is a big problem, and it’s a tremendous problem for drugs pouring in and destroying our youth, and, really, destroying the fabric of our country. There’s never been a drug problem like we have today. And as I said, much of it comes from the southern border.
So in the meantime, I will fulfill my sacred obligation to protect our country and defend the United States of America. And this is a defense of our country. We have no choice. We have no choice. We will defend our borders, we will defend our country.
Thank you very much.
Q Mr. President, what happens to the children then? If you’re ending catch-and-release, what happens to those children? Do they stay in these tent cities? Or what happens?
THE PRESIDENT: We’re working on a system where they stay together. But I will say that, by doing that, tremendous numbers — you know, under the Obama plan, you could separate children. They never did anything about that. Nobody talks about that. But under President Obama, they separated children from the parents. We actually put it so that that didn’t happen.
But what happens when you do that is you get tremendous numbers of people coming. It’s almost like an incentive to — when they hear they’re not going to be separated, they come many, many times over. But President Obama separated the children, the parents. And nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, this country went crazy.
So we are going to continue and try to continue what we’re doing. But it is a tremendous incentive for people to try. But it’s going to be very, very hard for people to come into our country. So we think we’ll be able to do that.
Q With the military, do you envision them firing upon any of these people?
THE PRESIDENT: I hope not.
Q Could you see the military (inaudible)?
THE PRESIDENT: I hope not. It’s the military — I hope — I hope there won’t be that. But I will tell you this: Anybody throwing stones, rocks — like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military, Mexican police, where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico — we will consider that a firearm. Because there’s not much difference, where you get hit in the face with a rock — which, as you know, it was very violent a few days ago — very, very violent — that break-in. It was a break-in of a country. They broke into Mexico.
And you look at what’s happening in Guatemala, just to mention Guatemala, along with El Salvador and Honduras. It’s disgraceful that those countries aren’t able to stop this. Because they should be able to stop it before it starts.
And the United States pays them a fortune, and we’re looking at not doing that anymore. Because why should we be doing that when they do nothing for us?
Jeff. Jeff, go ahead.
Q Mr. President, how is this plan going to be legal, considering the current law?
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, this is totally legal. No. This is legal. We are stopping people at the border. This is an invasion, and nobody is even questioning that.
Q But in terms of your plans to change asylum, are you going to do this via executive order?
THE PRESIDENT: No, no, you don’t have to — you don’t have to release. You have — you can hold. The problem is, to hold people, you need massive facilities. It’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Another country says, “Sorry, you can’t come in.” With us, we take their name, take their phone number, take their everything, and say, “Good luck.” Only because we don’t have the facilities to hold people. But we’re building the facilities now. We’re building massive numbers of tents, and we will hold them in tents. But you don’t have to release them. They released them only because they didn’t have the facilities to hold them.
Q Mr. President, is there like an executive order that you’re going to be releasing today?
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, we will be doing an executive order sometime next week, yes.
Q (Inaudible) executive order dealing with ending catch-and-release and asylum?
THE PRESIDENT: It’s going to end — it’s going to be talking about everything. It’ll be quite comprehensive. Many of the things we’ve talked about today.
Q Mr. President, so you’re — so just to clarify, you are speaking of, in the tents, these family units that would arrive (inaudible) the children?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, we have other facilities also. But what’s happened is we are holding so many facilities — so many people that our facilities are being overrun. They’re being overrun. And we are putting up temporary facilities. Eventually, people won’t be coming here anymore when they realize they can’t get through.
Q So they will hold the children in those tents with their parents?
THE PRESIDENT: We will be holding the family and the children together. Remember this: President Obama separated children from families. And all I did was take the same law, and then I softened the law. But by softening the law, many people come up that would not have come up if there was separation.
Q Mr. President, what do you say to the critics who think this is a political thing before the midterms?
THE PRESIDENT: There’s nothing political about a caravan of thousands of people, and now others forming, pouring up into our country. We have no idea who they are. All we know is they’re pretty tough people when they can blast through the Mexican military and Mexican police. They’re pretty tough people. Even Mexico said, “Wow, these are tough people.” I don’t want them in our country. And women don’t want them in our country. Women want security. Men don’t want them in our country. But the women do not want them. Women want security. You look at what the women are looking for. They want to have security. They don’t want to have these people in our country. And they’re not going to be in our country. It’s a very big thing.
Yes.
Q Mr. President, when you talk about finalizing a plan to end asylum, is this a plan that would be included in that executive order?
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, no, people are going to have a chance to go for asylum. But if you look at the records, not very many people are allowed to stay once they go to court. But what happens is they’d go into — they were using asylum — first of all, they were told what to say by lawyers and others. “Read this statement.” You read the statement, and now you’re seeking asylum. The whole thing is ridiculous. And we won’t put up with it any longer.
Q President Trump, U.S. law and international law says that people who have valid claims have a right to seek asylum.
THE PRESIDENT: That’s right.
Q So why would — why would they be —
THE PRESIDENT: Well, they’re going to go to court. They’re going to go to court, as crazy as it sounds. They’re going to go —
Q But the law say that they don’t — they’re not —
THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. Excuse me. Ready? They’re going to go to court, and a judge is going to determine. But usually, when they go to court, they’re deported. It just seems that most of the people are deported once they go. The problem is they never end up going to court, because when they come in, they’re told to come back in a year, for a court case, and they disappear into the United States never to be seen again.
But we’re going to be —
Q But the current laws doesn’t say about holding people in tent cities.
THE PRESIDENT: And they’re given deportation notices. We will be deporting those people.
Q Mr. President, you’re saying rocks are — rock-throwing, like happened in Mexico, will be considered —
THE PRESIDENT: We will consider that the maximum that we can consider that, because they’re throwing rocks viciously and violently. You saw that three days ago. Really hurting the military. We’re not going to put up with that. If they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We’re going to consider — and I told them, consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say, consider it a rifle.
Jeff?
Q A separate topic, sir. Did you offer Heather Nauert the job of U.N. Ambassador?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, she’s under very serious consideration. She’s excellent. She’s been with us a long time. She’s been a supporter for a long time. And she’s really excellent. So she’s under very serious — we’ll probably make a decision next week. We have a lot of people that want the job, and there are a lot of really great people. But we’ll be talking about that next week sometime.
Q Did you see Oprah Winfrey’s comments today?
THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t. What did she say?
Q She was campaigning in Georgia at the same time that Vice President Pence was.
THE PRESIDENT: At the same time as who?
Q Excuse me, at the same time Vice President Pence was, encouraging people to vote and —
THE PRESIDENT: Well, that’s okay. I mean, I was on Oprah’s last week — the last week of her show. Oprah liked me very much. I’ve always liked Oprah. You know, Oprah is good. But the woman that she’s supporting is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia, by any stretch of the imagination.
And I’ll be in Georgia the next few days — the next few days — and we have a tremendous — around Macon — we have a tremendous crowd already. Nobody has a crowd like we have because people want to see a great governor of Georgia. And I think Brian is going to be a great governor of Georgia. I think he’ll be a fantastic governor. He’s totally qualified.
She is not qualified to be the governor of Georgia. She’s not qualified. And Georgia is a great state —
Q Why is she not qualified?
THE PRESIDENT: — it’s a great, great state. Take a — take a look. Take a look at her past. Take a look at her history. Take a look at what she wants to do and what she has in mind for the state. That state will be in big, big trouble very quickly. And the people of Georgia don’t want that.
Question?
Q Mr. President, really quickly, just on election integrity? Can you say for a fact that our elections are secure next week? What can you tell us?
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, yeah. I just met with — I just met with the FBI, with Chris; and the Justice Department; and with Secretary Nielsen. And they’ve spent a lot of time and effort and some money on making sure that everything with respect to the election coming up in five days is going to be perfect and safe. There will be hopefully no meddling, no tampering, no nothing. And we spent a lot —
Now President Obama had the chance to do that in September before ’16, but he chose not to do that because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. And while everybody agrees it didn’t affect the vote at all, nevertheless he could have done things that probably would have made it a little more obvious, a little clearer. But he was told by the FBI in September before the election in ’16 about potential meddling or potential Russian meddling, and he did nothing about it. He didn’t do that because he thought that Hillary Clinton would win.
All right, one more.
Q Are you optimistic that you can still get the continuing resolution through December 7th for Homeland Security funded, even if the Democrats take the House?
THE PRESIDENT: I think if — I think we’re going to do very well in the election, I must tell you. If you look at the races, if you look at the Senate, which is very important, obviously. I’m leaving today; I’ll be in Missouri. And I’ll be touching down at a number of places over the next five days. But I think we’re doing very well in the Senate, and I think we’re doing very well in the House.
The only problem is, with the House, there’s so many people. I’d like to stop for every one of them, but there’s so many people. But I think we’re doing very well in the House. I think people want to see strong borders. I think they want to see security. They want to see good healthcare. They want to see the things that we’re providing. They don’t want to have their taxes increased. We’re decreasing their taxes.
We just announced yesterday, you probably heard — Kevin Brady put it out — a reduction of tax. We’re going for a reduction of middle-income tax or 10 percent. The Democrats want to, I mean, double up your taxes. In some cases, you’ll have to pay three times what you’re paying right now in order to get bad healthcare.
And so what we’re doing is something that I think the people want, and I think we’re going to do very well in the election, even though history says that whoever President it — whoever the President may be, it trends the other way. It certainly does seem that way.
But nobody has ever been President that has the greatest economy in the history of our country. This is the greatest economy in the history of our country. These are the greatest unemployment and employment numbers in the history of our country. Nobody has ever had that to campaign with. So I do.
Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Myth vs. Fact
We have seen reporters, Members of Congress, and other groups mislead the public on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) policies. This page will be updated regularly.
Federal law enforcement officers have sworn duties to enforce the laws that Congress passes.  Repeating intentionally untrue and unsubstantiated statements about DHS agents, officers, and procedures is irresponsible and deeply disrespectful to the men and women who risk their lives every day to secure our border and enforce our laws.
MYTH: ICE allows for the transportation of detainees under inhumane conditions
FACT: ICE has zero tolerance for inappropriate and inhumane treatment of anyone we encounter, under any circumstance.  Every step possible is taken to ensure that these individuals are provided with food, water, restroom breaks and that they are processed as quickly as possible.
MYTH: DHS does not provide language translators
FACT: Both ICE and CBP have Language Access Plans in place to provide access to individuals with limited English proficiency. These plans include a process to identify the language spoken and the use of interpreters, either in-person or telephonically.
MYTH: ICE intimidates detainees into signing documents to separate them from their children
FACT: Asking parents in ICE custody, who are subject to a final order of removal, to make a decision about being removed with or without their children, is part of long-standing policy. For parents who have a final order of removal, and whose children have not received a final order, it is the parent’s decision whether to return with or without their children. ICE accommodates, to the extent practicable, the parent’s efforts to make provisions for the children. As appropriate, ICE will work with the parent to have the child return with the parent to their country of citizenship.  When a child is in the care and custody of HHS/ORR, ICE works with ORR to reunite the parent and child and with the consulate to assist the parent with obtaining a travel document for the child.  Alternatively, a parent may opt to have ORR pursue release of the child to another parent, guardian, or sponsor who has been approved by ORR.  ICE does not interfere in the parent’s decision to allow the child to remain in the U.S. to pursue his or her own legal claim.
When parents are removed without their children, ICE, ORR, and the consulates work together to coordinate the return of a child and transfer of custody to the parent or foreign government upon arrival in country, in accordance with repatriation agreements between the U.S. and other countries. Unaccompanied children often are received by the country’s child welfare agency, who facilitate the reunification. When possible, ORR and ICE coordinate with in-country repatriation programs, which provide services to returned, unaccompanied children.
MYTH: ICE makes arrests at sensitive locations like schools and hospitals
FACT: ICE policy states that enforcement actions at sensitive locations, such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship, should generally be avoided. This policy is intended to enhance public understanding and trust in ICE’s enforcement actions and to ensure that people seeking to participate in activities or use services provided at sensitive locations are free to do so without fear or hesitation. ICE policy does not consider courthouses as a sensitive location.
MYTH: ICE should obtain judicial arrest warrants to take custody of aliens
FACT: Congress has established no process, requirement, or expectation directing ICE to seek a judicial warrant from already overburdened federal courts before taking custody of an alien on civil immigration violations. The authority to issue an administrative arrest warrant has been granted to Executive Branch officials by Congress and that authority has been delegated to certain immigration officers (8 CFR 236.1). In an attempt to undermine immigration enforcement, many sanctuary policies and related rulings fail to recognize this lawful process established by Congress and instead seek to impose a requirement for which there is no legal authority.
MYTH: ICE Family Residential Centers do not provide medical care for detainees
FACT: As detailed in a DHS Inspector General’s report, the family residential centers are “clean, well-organized, and efficiently run.” Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment families arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay. Everyone receives medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to daily sick call and 24-hour emergency care. Pursuant to our commitment to the welfare of those in the agency’s custody, ICE annually spends more than $250 million on the spectrum of healthcare services provided to detainees.
MYTH: DHS is turning away asylum seekers at ports of entry
FACT: CBP processes all aliens arriving at all ports of entry without documents as expeditiously as possible without negatively affecting the agency's primary mission to protect the American public from dangerous people and materials while enhancing the nation’s economic competitiveness through facilitating legitimate trade and travel.
As the number of arriving aliens determined to be inadmissible at ports of entry continues to rise, CBP must prioritize its limited resources to ensure its primary mission is being executed.  Depending on port circumstances at the time of arrival, CBP officials will allocate the necessary resources to its primary mission and operate appropriate access controls and queue management procedures for those arriving aliens without proper travel documents.    
MYTH: DHS separates families who entered at the ports of entry and who are seeking asylum – even though they have not broken the law
FACT: If an adult enters at a port of entry and claims asylum, they will not face prosecution for illegal entry. DHS does have a responsibility to protect minors we apprehend and will only separate in three circumstances, as previous Administrations have done:1) when DHS is unable to determine the familial relationship, 2) when DHS determines that a child may be at risk with the parent or legal guardian, or 3) when the parent or legal guardian is referred for criminal prosecution.
MYTH: Checkpoints are unconstitutional and equivalent to a warrantless search
FACT: As the Supreme Court recognized in United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976), immigration checkpoints are both a constitutional and necessary law enforcement tool to determine the immigration status of all individuals passing through the checkpoint during its hours of operation. 
USBP checkpoints, both fixed and temporary, are a proven, effective layer in our multi-layered approach to securing the border and interdicting unlawful entry.  Checkpoints are strategically placed where potentially illegal cross border traffic is most likely to converge as it makes egress away from the border into the United States.  Travelers in vehicles are briefly questioned as to their citizenship to ensure those out of status are prevented from further entry into the interior of the country in violation of U.S. immigration laws.  USBP also makes significant seizures of illegal drugs at checkpoints each month.  In FY 2017, agents apprehended over 6,000 illegal aliens and seized over 75,000 pounds of illegal narcotics.
MYTH: The Administration is not building President Trump’s border wall
FACT: Construction is well underway on the wall. Congress appropriated $341M in FY17 and $1.375B in FY18.  Total = 1.716B. With FY 2017 and 2018 funding we are building 140 miles. Our FY 2019 request is for an additional 65 miles.
El Centro PF Replacement Project (2.25 miles):
Construction is on schedule for completion in October 2018.
El Paso VF Replacement Project (20 miles):
Construction is on schedule for completion in March 2019.
San Diego Primary Replacement Project (14 miles):
Construction is on schedule for completion in May 2019.
El Paso PF Replacement Project (4 miles):
Construction remains on track to start in September.
MYTH: The National Guard has not helped in efforts to secure the southern border
FACT: Operation Guardian Support has led to more than 13,600 arrests and the seizure of more than 14,000 pounds of illicit drugs. While National Guard troops are not physically arresting aliens or seizing contraband, these outcomes are attributed to the support they provide, including monitoring sensors and operating detection systems. Ultimately, the mission gives us more eyes on cameras, more aircraft in the air surveilling and more boots on the ground patrolling.

Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has implemented enhanced security procedures for small boat arrivals. This increased enforcement posture requires physical reporting to a designated local CBP office when returning from foreign ports or locations for a face-to-face inspection, unless enrolled in an alternative inspection program that would allow arrival reporting by app or phone.
Pleasure Boat Clearance Procedures
Clearance procedures for pleasure boats arriving at the United States from foreign port include: 
Arrivals to the US Virgin Islands from a foreign port and,
Arrivals to Puerto Rico (including Vieques and Culebra) from the US Virgin Islands and foreign ports

Senior Enlisted Leaders learn threats, challenges of Southwest Border firsthand
TUCSON, Ariz  –  
(Aug. 23, 2018) -- Command senior enlisted leaders, led by Army Command Sgt. Maj. John Wayne Troxell, senior enlisted advisor to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, traveled the U.S.-Mexico border last week to learn about the threats and challenges that affect the nation stemming from drug trafficking, human trafficking and other cartels.

Troxell and his 24-member Defense Senior Enlisted Leader Council traveled about 1,000 miles of Southwest border territory from Aug. 13 to 15 to observe and report back to their leaders about border concerns and the assistance the Defense Department and the National Guard are providing.

“We should promote what we can do at the tactical and strategic levels,” Troxell said following numerous briefings and Border Patrol tours. The senior enlisted contingent from all around the United States toured numerous ports of entry and border stations and were briefed by law enforcement officials of the threats that exist along the border.

Defense Secretary James N. Mattis authorized up to 4,000 National Guard troops in April, and 2,100 are deployed for the mission. The Guard members are working behind the scenes to free up U.S. Border Patrol agents and Customs and Border Patrol officers to search ports of entry and the border by four-wheel-drive vehicles, all-terrain vehicles, horseback, aviation and boats on the Rio Grande River.

“As we continue to get after bad people around the world, it was important that we brought this [summit] together so that we could see firsthand not only the interagency fusion that’s happening between the border, but more importantly, [we saw] the passion and quiet professionalism of every border patrol agent that’s on some of the roughest terrain that you can find,” Troxell said.

“They don’t have all the resources or people they want to have, but through the use of the ‘big three’ – people, technology and tactical infrastructure – they’re mitigating the risks as best they can, and leveraging our DoD assets to assist and continue to get after the mission,” he emphasized. “My takeaway is when people inside the Beltway – especially up on the Hill – start having these preconceived notions about what’s happening down there, I can say, ‘[That’s inaccurate]. I was just there; I had the senior-most enlisted leaders in the DoD with me.’”
Interagency Collaboration Vital

Troxell said he was impressed by interagency collaboration and cooperation among DoD, the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, Border Patrol agents and Customs and Border Patrol officers.  
“Defending the homeland by, with and through our partners is based on a DoD effort to detect and monitor in the other areas we call ‘find and fix’ so that our partner forces can [fix issues], whether it’s an illicit product, illegal aliens or drug trafficking,” he said.
The American public, Troxell added, needs to understand that its National Guard has an important mission, not only in their home states, but also in defending the U.S. homeland. 
“Our National Guardsmen … are not doing any law-enforcement activities. They are supporting law enforcement. So being able to get down here and get my eyes on that, along with this collective group of senior enlisted leaders, confirms what I already knew: We are not violating codes or authorities in the use of our Guardsmen,” he said.
If the United States was trying to end the war on drugs with a victory, it would take a lot more resources, Troxell noted.
“Joint Task Force North is doing an effective job within their mission and their respective authorities to assist law enforcement in disrupting and deterring drug trafficking organizations, transnational criminal organizations and illicit product coming in our country,” he said, speaking of a task force that falls under North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command.

Briefings Outline Concerns

“The threat is what’s getting away – the drugs, aliens and bad actors,” a Rio Grande Valley sector Border Patrol agent said of South Texas at one of the numerous briefings for the summit leaders.
The participants learned the Southwest border has nine sectors from California to Texas. In South Texas, no structure is in place to stop the cartels’ passage, and about 52 tons of marijuana comes over the border every week, along with about 6,000 people, resulting in about 3,800 apprehensions. Other challenges in South Texas are gang violence from groups such as MS13, home invasions and innovations such as drones carrying drugs across the border.
The senior enlisted leaders also learned that while the bulk of illegal aliens are South American, many come from all over the world, including 15 Yemen citizens this year. They were also told illegal border crossing is considered not just a U.S. problem, but an international one, and that the United States is working with Mexican authorities on the passage of the illegal cartels. More than 90 percent of drugs in the world come through Mexico, which also is the world’s third-largest heroin grower, the leaders learned. The Border Patrol says that every eight minutes, an American dies of an overdose.
Combatant Commands Attacking Networks

Senior enlisted leader Marine Corps Sgt. Maj. Bryan K. Zickefoose of U.S. Southern Command, which faces its own border challenges, said Southcom is about attacking the networks. “There are a lot of networks out there,” he said. “One of the biggest things is how the network with Southcom affects U.S. Northern Command, and that connection, and how it comes together [is] how we can work together better.”  

Marine Corps Sgt. Maj. Aaron G. McDonald, command senior enlisted leader for Joint Task Force North, organized the summit at Troxell’s request. “I hope that each one of the senior enlisted leaders walks away with a greater understanding of what Joint Task Force North does as far as the Title 10 forces provided by DoD [are concerned], and how we partner with our law enforcement agencies, from the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of Justice,” he said. 

McDonald said he also hopes the senior leaders at the summit saw opportunities that are available for their formations to volunteer and come to the Southwest border to take advantage of opportunities not only to support law enforcement agencies, “but also to enhance their readiness to take on emerging threats across the globe.”
He told the command senior enlisted leaders that 72,000 Americans died in 2017 because of drug overdoses, adding that this is more than those who died fighting during the Vietnam War and every conflict since then.
“So the threat is real -- it does affect national security -- but there are good men and women who are dedicated professionals both in law enforcement and in the Department of Defense getting after the problem,” McDonald said. “This mission is unique, and it develops the readiness of a force with specific skill sets that will make them even more effective in our national security as well as abroad.”

Global Policing Goals
Promoting security as a foundation for sustainable development
Today’s security challenges are interconnected and global, threatening the sustainable development of society. Multilateral collaboration among law enforcement agencies is therefore vital to address these complex and evolving security risks.
As the only police organization that works at the global level, INTERPOL plays a unique role in supporting international efforts to safeguard communities and make the world a safer place.
To do this in a consistent manner across the world, it is important that all actors in the global security architecture share an understanding of the threats and work towards the same outcomes.
We developed seven Global Policing Goals (GPGs) to address a range of issues related to crime and security. Endorsed by our member countries in 2017, the Goals were officially launched in 2018.
Consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principle of neutrality (enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution respectively), the Global Policing Goals are universal, ambitious and underpinned by collective action.
The Global Policing Goals focus on the collective efforts of the international law enforcement community to create a safer and more sustainable world for future generations.
INTERPOL’s seven Global Policing Goals
Goal 1: Enable the global law enforcement community to more effectively counter and prevent terrorism through international cooperation
Goal 2: Promote border security worldwide
Goal 3: Enhance the law enforcement response to protecting vulnerable communities
Goal 4: Reduce the global harm and impact of cybercrime
Goal 5: Tackle corruption and financial crime in all its forms
Goal 6: Counter serious organized crime and drug trafficking
Goal 7: Strengthen environmental security and support the promotion of sustainable livelihoods by countering crimes that affect the environment and climate
Positive impact on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
INTERPOL’s General Secretariat published a report in 2020 to show the relations – both direct and indirect – between each of the seven INTERPOL GPGs and individual United Nations SDGs and their targets.
In some cases, all seven INTERPOL GPGs support the same UN SDG, due to the crosscutting nature of the SDG in question. This is particularly the case for SDG 5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls), and SDG 17 (Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development). In other cases, the links between the GPGs and SDGs are more specific.
2023 Review Process
The evolving security landscape has been increasingly driven by technological innovation. The GPGs were therefore reviewed in 2023 as part of a collaborative process led by INTERPOL in cooperation with regional law enforcement agencies from around the world. The outcome of this review was adopted during our centenary police conference in Vienna, Austria.
The 2023 review process of the GPGs was conducted in parallel with the mid-term review of the implementation of the SDGs. This review identified five core areas which will have an impact on policing in the future:
Data and information sharing
Collaboration and partnerships
Good governance, rule of law and respect for human rights
Capacity building and training, innovation and digitalization
Enablers of cybercrime and financial crime

Stopping Illegal Immigration and Securing the Border
The Department of Homeland Security is committed to enforcing our immigration laws so that we can secure our border and keep the American people safe. DHS is taking action to disrupt cartels, smugglers, and nefarious actors. These actions include referring and then prosecuting 100 percent of illegal border crossers, building the first new border wall in a decade, and deploying the National Guard to the border.
However, smugglers, human traffickers, and nefarious actors know our loopholes well and continue to exploit them. To truly keep the American people safe, we must end legal loopholes that have left us with policies that serve as tremendous magnets for illegal immigration.

SPEECH
Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks Discussing the Immigration Enforcement Actions of the Trump Administration
Monday, May 7, 2018
Share
Location
San Diego, CA
United States
Thank you all for being here.

Thank you to Tom Homan.  Tom, you have done outstanding work leading ICE.  Thank you for your more than 30 years of service in law enforcement.  We are going to miss you.

Today we are here to send a message to the world: we are not going to let this country be overwhelmed.

People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border. 

We need legality and integrity in the system.

That’s why the Department of Homeland Security is now referring 100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution.  And the Department of Justice will take up those cases.

I have put in place a “zero tolerance” policy for illegal entry on our Southwest border.  If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you.  It’s that simple.

If you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, then we will prosecute you.

If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.

If you make false statements to an immigration officer or file a fraudulent asylum claim, that’s a felony. 

If you help others to do so, that’s a felony, too.  You’re going to jail.

So if you’re going to come to this country, come here legally.  Don’t come here illegally.

In order to carry out these important new enforcement policies, I have sent 35 prosecutors to the Southwest and moved 18 immigration judges to the border.  These are supervisory judges that don’t have existing caseloads and will be able to function full time on moving these cases.  That will be about a 50 percent increase in the number of immigration judges who will be handling the asylum claims.

These actions are necessary.  And they are made even more necessary by the massive increases in illegal crossings in recent months.  This February saw 55 percent more border apprehensions than last February.  This March saw triple the number from last March.  April saw triple the number last April. 

The trends are clear: this must end.

Eleven million people are already here illegally.  That’s more than the population of Portugal or the state of Georgia. 

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that those 11 million have 4.5 million children who are American citizens.  Combined, that group would be our fifth-most populous state.

This situation has been many years in the making. 

For decades, the American people have been pleading with our elected representatives for a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest—a system we can be proud of.

That is not too much to ask.  The American people are right and just and decent to ask for this.  They are right to want a safe, secure border and a government that knows who is here and who isn’t.

Donald Trump ran for office on that idea.  I believe that is a big reason why he won. He is on fire about this. This entire government knows it. 

The American people have a right to expect that the laws that their representatives voted for are going to be carried out.  Failure to enforce our duly-enacted laws would be an affront to the American people and a threat to our very system of self-government.

And these laws are the most generous immigration laws in the world.  We accept 1.1 million lawful permanent residents every year—that’s more than the population of Montana, every single year.  These are the highest numbers in the world.

I have no doubt that many of those crossing our border illegally are leaving difficult situations.  But we cannot take everyone on Earth who is in a difficult situation.

According to a Gallup poll from a few years ago, 150 million people around the world want to immigrate to the United States.  Gallup says that 37 percent of Liberians want to immigrate to the United States.  One fifth of Cambodians want to move here.  One-in-six Salvadorans are already in the United States—and another 19 percent tell Gallup they want to come here.

It’s obvious that we cannot take everyone who wants to come here without also hurting the interests of the citizens we are sworn to serve and protect.

We have to have limits.  And Congress has already set them. 

And if you want to change our laws, then pass a bill in Congress.  Persuade your fellow citizens to your point of view.

Immigrants should ask to apply lawfully before they enter our country.  Citizens of other countries don’t get to violate our laws or rewrite them for us. People around the world have no right to demand entry in violation of our sovereignty. 

This is a great nation—the greatest in the history of the world.  It is no surprise that people want to come here.  But they must do so properly.  They must follow our laws—or not come here at all. Make no mistake, the objections, the lawsuits, the sanctuary jurisdictions are often the product of a radical open border philosophy. They oppose all enforcement. 

And so this Department, under President Trump’s leadership, is enforcing the law without exception.  We will finally secure this border so that we can give the American people safety and peace of mind.  That’s what the people deserve.

Thank you.

Based on CBP’s expertise as the front-line border security agency for the United States, these programs are designed to build the capacity of foreign law enforcement agencies to implement more effective customs operations, border policing, and immigration inspections.
On average, CBP coordinates and presents over one hundred training programs to thousands of foreign participants each year. Training and assistance programs target the full range of border control and operations, including: weapons of mass effect (WME) training, anti-narcotics, port security, integrity, and commercial operations.  The majority of these programs take place outside of the United States, although CBP hosts a limited number of training events at specific U.S. ports of entry so students can observe the manner in which enforcement techniques, inter-agency coordination, and infrastructure combine to produce positive results.

CBP undertakes most of its technical assistance work with funding from the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Department of Defense.  In addition to implementing established multi-year initiatives such as the Export Control and related Border Security (EXBS) assistance program, port security advisory projects in several Latin American countries, CBP responds to ad hoc requests for assistance channeled through U.S. Embassies around the world.

Validating the Power of Attorney
Because the Power of Attorney (POA) can authorize the movement of conveyances and merchandise into the United States, it is critical that it be examined carefully.  By ensuring that each POA is valid, the broker joins U.S. Custom and Border Protection on the national security frontlines in verifying the data used to screen what enters this country.
In addition to security, the broker’s own professional business interest and continuing obligation to demonstrate “reasonable care” require verification of the POA grantor’s identity and legal authority (position in a company or partnership) to enter into a POA.
Within Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee's (COAC) recommendation 010045, it is suggested that to verify the authenticity of information provided by the importer to the broker, the broker could review publicly available open source information regarding the importer’s business and as appropriate. 
Here are some ways the broker can validate a Power of Attorney: 
To the greatest extent possible, have POA’s completed in person so the grantor’s unexpired government issued photo identification (driver’s license, passport, etc.) can be reviewed.
Check applicable web sites to verify the POA grantor’s business and registration with the State authority.
If the principal uses a trade or fictitious name in doing business, confirm that the name appears on the POA.
Verify that the importer’s name, importer’s number and Employer Identification Number (also known as the Federal Tax Identification Number) on the POA match what is in ACE.
Verify the importer’s address is a “brick and mortar” location on a public mapping program, and not simply a “postal box” or undeveloped parcel of land.
Dial the provided phone landline number for authentication.
Cross-check the provided information through a third party entity, ie: credit report, DUN’s number, or similar business identifying entity.
Access the client’s website for depth of content versus only a surface containing a landing page.
Check whether the POA grantor is named as a sanctioned or restricted person or entity by the U.S. Government.  See the Bureau of Industry and Security’s Export Enforcement (https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/oee).

Highlights
What GAO Found
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) increased its emphasis on recruitment by establishing a central recruitment office and increasing its participation in recruitment events, among other things. As a result, the number of applications it received for law enforcement positions across its operational components—the Office of Field Operations, U.S. Border Patrol, and Air and Marine Operations—from fiscal years (FY) 2013 through 2017 more than tripled. Also, in November 2017, CBP hired a contractor to more effectively target potential applicants and better utilize data to enhance CBP's recruitment efforts. However, it is too early to gauge whether the contractor will be effective in helping CBP to achieve its goal to recruit and hire more law enforcement officers.
CBP improved its hiring process as demonstrated by two key metrics—reducing its time-to-hire and increasing the percentage of applicants that are hired. As shown in the table, CBP's time-to-hire has decreased since FY 2015. CBP officials stated these improvements, paired with increases in applications, have resulted in more hires. For example, the number of Border Patrol agents hired in the first half of FY 2018 increased by about 83 percent when compared to the same period for FY 2017. However, the hiring process remains lengthy—for example, in FY 2017 it took more than 300 days, on average, for CBP officer applicants to complete the process. Certain factors contribute to the lengthy time-to-hire, including process steps that can be challenging and time-consuming for applicants to complete—such as the polygraph exam—as well as CBP's reliance on applicants to promptly complete certain aspects of the process—such as submitting their background investigation form.

Source: GAO analysis of CBP data. | GAO-18-487
CBP enhanced its efforts to address retention challenges. However, staffing levels for law enforcement positions consistently remained below target levels. For example, CBP ended FY 2017 more than 1,100 CBP officers below its target staffing level. Officials cited employees' inability to relocate to more desirable locations as a key retention challenge. CBP has offered some relocation opportunities to law enforcement personnel and has recently pursued the use of financial incentives and other payments to supplement salaries, especially for those staffed to remote or hard-to-fill locations. However, CBP does not have a formal process for capturing information on all departing employees, such as an exit survey. Ensuring that operational components are systematically collecting and analyzing such information would better position CBP to understand its retention challenges and take appropriate action to address them.
Why GAO Did This Study
CBP is responsible for securing U.S. borders and employs nearly 45,000 law enforcement officers across its three operational components at and between U.S. ports of entry, in the air and maritime environment, and at certain overseas locations. In recent years, CBP has not attained target staffing levels for its law enforcement positions, citing high attrition rates in some locations, a protracted hiring process, and competition from other law enforcement agencies. GAO was asked to review CBP's efforts to recruit, hire, and retain law enforcement personnel.
This report examines CBP's efforts to (1) recruit qualified law enforcement officers, (2) more efficiently hire law enforcement applicants, and (3) retain law enforcement officers. GAO analyzed CBP data on recruitment, hiring, and retention from FY 2013 through 2017, as well as selected data for the first two quarters of FY 2018. GAO also reviewed CBP strategies and the recent contract it awarded to augment its recruiting and hiring activities and interviewed officials from CBP and three other selected law enforcement agencies.
Recommendations
GAO recommends that CBP systematically collect and analyze data on departing law enforcement officers and use this information to inform retention efforts. DHS concurred with this recommendation.
Recommendations for Executive Action
Agency Affected Recommendation Status
United States Customs and Border Protection The Commissioner of CBP should ensure that its operational components systematically collect and analyze data on departing law enforcement officers and use this information to inform retention efforts. (Recommendation 1)
Closed – Implemented
DHS concurred with our recommendation and, as of October 2019, had taken actions to implement it. Specifically, CBP implemented an agency-wide exit survey and used this survey to collect and analyze data on departing law enforcement officers. Implementing a CBP-wide exit survey to collect and analyze these data indicates that CBP has committed to understanding its retention challenges. Further, CBP is using these data to inform its retention efforts by identifying the key reasons law enforcement officers cite for leaving the agency and aligning CBP initiatives to address these cited reasons. Based on these actions, we consider the recommendation closed as implemented.

Security Screening
TSA incorporates unpredictable security measures, both seen and unseen, to accomplish our transportation security mission.
Security measures begin long before you arrive at the airport. TSA works closely with the intelligence and law enforcement communities to share information. Additional security measures are in place from the time you get to the airport until you get to your destination.
TSA adjusts processes and procedures to meet the evolving threat and to achieve the highest levels of transportation security. Because of this, you may notice changes in our procedures from time to time.
TSA counts on the traveling public to report unattended bags or packages; individuals in possession of a threatening item; and persons trying to enter a restricted area or similar suspicious activities at airports, train stations, bus stops and ports. If You See Something, Say Something™. Report suspicious activity to local law enforcement.
Passenger screening at the airport is part of TSA’s layered approach to security to get you safely to your destination. TSA’s screening procedures are intended to prevent prohibited items and other threats to transportation security from entering the sterile area of the airport and are developed in response to information on threats to transportation security. Learn more by viewing this timeline of transportation security events and measures.

Department Of Homeland Security U.S. Immigration And Customs Enforcement (ICE)
U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT 
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) mission is to protect America from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety.  Securing our nation's borders and safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system is a primary focus of ICE officers and agents throughout the country.  For more information, visit https://www.ice.gov/.  
STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAM 
The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program that administers the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a web-based system for maintaining information on nonimmigrants (and their dependents) whose primary reason for coming to the United States is to be students and/or exchange visitors in the United States as well as on SEVP-certified schools.  It ensures that government agencies have essential data related to nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors to preserve national security.  SEVP provides approval and oversight to schools authorized to enroll F and M nonimmigrant students and gives guidance to both schools and students about the requirements for maintaining their status.  The Department of State manages Exchange Visitor Programs (called BridgeUSA), nonimmigrant exchange visitors in the J visa classification and their dependents.  Both SEVP and BridgeUSA use SEVIS to track and monitor schools; exchange visitor programs; and F, M and J nonimmigrants while they visit the United States and participate in the U.S. education system.
To contact the SEVP Response Center, please email SEVP@ice.dhs.gov any time or call 1-800-892-4829, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. ET, except Federal holidays.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security maintains Study in the States, a comprehensive free government resource that explains the rules and regulations governing the nonimmigrant student process in the United States including the student visa process.  Get the latest COVID-19 news, SEVP updates, and guidance for students and schools through the Study in the States blog.  On social media, follow Study in the States on Facebook and Twitter.
U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES (USCIS) 
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is the government agency that oversees lawful immigration to the United States.  USCIS was founded to enhance the security and efficiency of national immigration services by focusing exclusively on the administration of benefit applications.  For more information, visit https://www.uscis.gov/.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has published additional online resources on uscis.gov to provide an overview of some of the temporary and permanent pathways for noncitizens to work in the United States in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This guide also highlights some of the most important considerations for STEM professionals who want to work in the United States.

------------
As part of ICE, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) examines, deters and interdicts threats arising from the movement of people and goods into and out of the United States. With respect to international students, HSI established ICE’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and the web-based Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to collect, maintain and analyze information so that only legitimate nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors gain entry to the United States.
School Fraud
HSI is committed to safeguarding the integrity of our nation’s legal immigration system against fraud and exploitation. Successful partnerships between HSI and local school communities expose fraud that may compromise national security. HSI’s collaboration with the school community may prevent individuals posing as students from fraudulently obtaining or maintaining student status.
Partnerships Benefit All
Information sharing between HSI, schools and students has enhanced strategies for identifying and prosecuting unlawful activity, and has improved schools’ management of programs and prevention of students from falling out of status. HSI’s investigation of noncompliant schools upholds the integrity of legitimate schools and programs.
How You can Help
Foreign nationals may view a student visa as a means of immigrating rather than achieving an academic goal. As a school official, you have the responsibility to ensure that the foreign students you enroll intend to be productive students. You may also help identify situations before they become national security concerns.
To help ICE prevent criminal exploitation of SEVP, and to improve communication with local HSI special agents, you can assist in identifying students or school officials who intend to harm the United States or its people. If you become suspicious of a school or student’s actions, call your local ICE office.
To report exploitation of student visa programs, contact your local HSI special agent or call 1-866-DHS-2ICE (1-866-347- 2423). More information is available at www.ice.gov.
To report national vulnerabilities or national security concerns, contact ICE’s Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit at CTCEU@ice.dhs.gov.

ACE facilitates legitimate trade while strengthening border security by providing government officials with better automated tools and information.
Across government and industry, automated capabilities, agreements, and business and technical requirements are in place to transmit and process import and export data electronically in ACE.
ACE Features and Benefits - Overview of how manual processes are streamlined and automated; paper has been eliminated and the trade community can more easily and efficiently comply with U.S. laws and regulations.
Antidumping and Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD)
    TFTEA established a new administrative procedure for investigating allegations of evasion of AD/CVD orders (i.e., including ability to draw adverse inferences for failing to provide information). CBP enforces AD/CVD orders as part of the agency's efforts to ensure a level playing field for U.S. industry.

We Must Secure The Border And Build The Wall To Make America Safe Again
Release Date: February 15, 2018
Walls Work. When it comes to stopping drugs and illegal aliens across our borders, border walls have proven to be extremely effective. Border security relies on a combination of border infrastructure, technology, personnel and partnerships with law enforcement at the state, local, tribal, and federal level.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehends over 1,100 people a day crossing the border illegally. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refuses entry to 7 known or suspected terrorists every day, 50 every week, and 2,500 every year.
DHS has seen a 300 percent increase in unaccompanied alien children (UACs) in the last eight months of 2017 – and a 600 percent increase in family units.
In Fiscal Year 2017, Border Patrol saw a 73 percent increase in assaults on officers along the Southwest border.
Thousands of aliens illegally re-enter the United States each year, with approximately 15,700 sentenced for illegal reentry in fiscal year 2016. This does not even include the many thousands more who evade detection, or those who are not charged with illegal reentry as part of a plea agreement.
The border jurisdictions bear the brunt of illegal alien crime, which is a large portion of the total crime in the United States. Of the 53,908 criminal cases filed by federal prosecutors in the 94 U.S. District Courts in fiscal year 2016, 23,573 cases (43.7 percent) were located in just the five border districts (Arizona, Southern District of California, New Mexico, Southern District of Texas, and Western District of Texas). In the five border districts, noncitizens accounted for 73.5 percent of all federal offenders sentenced for felonies or Class A misdemeanors in fiscal year 2016, and 47 percent of all federal non-immigration felonies or Class A misdemeanors.
Half of all federal criminal cases filed in U.S. District Courts in fiscal year 2016 (25,965 of 53,908 cases) were referred by the Department of Homeland Security.
Simply put—walls work. They have worked in Yuma, Arizona as a result of the 2006 Bipartisan Secure Border Act. They have also worked in San Diego. Both areas have seen 95 percent drops in attempted illegal border crossings.
Only 3.5 percent of UACs apprehended are eventually removed from the United States.
Illegal immigrants are incentivized to illegally enter by the low standard for credible fear and the lack of cost or sanction for filing a baseless asylum claim, which allows many of them to assert meritless claims that will not be adjudicated for years.
There has been a 1,700 percent increase in Credible Fear receipts from 2008 to 2016.
Annual asylum applications have tripled in the last 3 years.
There has been a 1,750 percent increase in the asylum backlog over the last 5 years. The affirmative asylum backlog at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has grown to 313,214 cases, as of January 28th. Another 290,000 asylum cases are pending in our immigration courts as of February 9.
The increase in claims filed is not associated with an increase in meritorious claims. As of FY 17, the asylum grant rate for defensive applications in immigration court is approximately 30%. On average, out of 88 claims that pass the credible fear screening, fewer than 13 will ultimately result in a grant of asylum.
The backlog of cases in our immigrations courts is approximately 675,000 cases.

KNOW YOUR RIGHTS
100 Mile Border Zone
The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects people from random and arbitrary stops and searches. Although the federal government claims the power to conduct certain kinds of warrantless stops within 100 miles of the U.S. border, important Fourth Amendment protections still apply. This helps you understand your rights within the 100-mile border zone.

Are immigration officials allowed to stop people in places wholly inside the U.S.?
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency tasked with patrolling the U.S. border and areas that function like a border, claims a territorial reach much larger than you might imagine. A federal law says that, without a warrant, CBP can board vehicles and vessels and search for people without immigration documentation “within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States.” These “external boundaries” include international land borders but also the entire U.S. coastline.

What is a “reasonable distance”?
The federal government defines a “reasonable distance” as 100 air miles from any external boundary of the U.S. So, combining this federal regulation and the federal law regarding warrantless vehicle searches, CBP claims authority to board a bus or train without a warrant anywhere within this 100-mile zone. Two-thirds of the U.S. population, or about 200 million people, reside within this expanded border region, according to the 2010 census. Most of the 10 largest cities in the U.S., such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, fall in this region. Some states, like Florida, lie entirely within this border band so their entire populations are impacted.

Are there limitations to immigration officials’ power?
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against arbitrary searches and seizures of people and their property, even in this expanded border area. Furthermore, as a general matter, these agents’ jurisdiction extends only to immigration violations and federal crimes. And, depending on where you are in this area and how long an agent detains you, agents must have varying levels of suspicion to hold you.
We will examine specific scenarios where one might encounter CBP in more depth, but here are your key rights. These apply to every situation, outside of customs and ports of entry.
You have the right to remain silent or tell the agent that you’ll only answer questions in the presence of an attorney, no matter your citizenship or immigration status. You do not have to answer questions about your immigration status. You may simply say that you do not wish to answer those questions. If you choose to remain silent, the agent will likely ask you questions for longer, but your silence alone is not enough to support probable cause or reasonable suspicion to arrest, detain, or search you or your belongings.
A limited exception does exist: for people who do have permission to be in the U.S. for a specific reason and for, usually, a limited amount of time (a “nonimmigrant” on a visa, for example), the law does require you to provide information about your immigration status if asked. While you can still choose to remain silent or decline a request to produce your documents, people in this category should be aware that they could face arrest consequences. If you want to know whether you fall into this category, you should consult an attorney.
Generally, an immigration officer cannot detain you without “reasonable suspicion.” Reasonable suspicion is less robust than probable cause, but it is certainly not just a hunch or gut feeling. An agent must have specific facts about you that make it reasonable to believe you are committing or committed, a violation of immigration law or federal law.
If an agent detains you, you can ask for their basis for reasonable suspicion, and they should tell you.
An immigration officer also cannot search you or your belongings without either “probable cause” or your consent. If an agent asks you if they can search your belongings, you have the right to say no.
An immigration officer cannot arrest you without “probable cause.”
That means the agent must have facts about you that make it probable that you are committing, or committed, a violation of immigration law or federal law.
Your silence alone meets neither of these standards. Nor does your race or ethnicity alone suffice for either probable cause or reasonable suspicion.
Other important factors to keep in mind:
If an agent asks you for documents, what you need to provide differs depending on your immigration status. U.S. citizens do not have to carry proof of citizenship on their person if they are in the United States. If you have valid immigration documents and are over the age of 18, the law does require you to carry those documents on you. If you are asked by an immigration agent to produce them, it is advisable to show the documents to the agent or you risk being arrested. If you are an immigrant without documents, you can decline the officer’s request. An agent may likely ask you more questions if you decline a request. No matter what category you fall into, never provide false documents to immigration officials.
People who have entered the U.S. without inspection by an immigration official may be subject to expedited removal from the U.S. Expedited removal is a summary deportation that bypasses an immigration judge. The federal government says that it will only attempt to apply expedited removal to individuals who have entered the United States without inspection in the last 14 days, have been encountered by an immigration officer within 100 miles of the border, and meet certain other criteria. If you are told that you are subject to expedited removal but do not fall within that category, you should let the agents know. Also, if you fear persecution if returned to your country of origin, you should immediately inform the agents of your fear.

How does this work in real life?: CBP on Buses and Trains
As part of its immigration enforcement efforts, CBP boards buses and trains in the 100-mile border region either at the station or while the bus is on its journey. More than one officer usually boards the bus, and they will ask passengers questions about their immigration status, ask passengers to show them immigration documents, or both. These questions should be brief and related to verifying one’s lawful presence in the U.S. Although these situations are scary, and it may seem that CBP agents are giving you an order when they ask you questions, you are not required to answer and can simply say you do not wish to do so. As always, you have the right to remain silent.
Refusing to answer CBP’s questions may result in the agent persisting with questioning. If this occurs, you should ask if you are being detained. Another way to ask this is to say, “am I free to leave?” If the agent wishes to actually detain you — in other words, you are not free to leave — the agent needs at least reasonable suspicion that you committed an immigration violation to do so. Also, if an agent begins to question you about non-immigration matters, say to ask about drug smuggling, or if they haul you off the bus, they need at least reasonable suspicion that you committed an offense in order to briefly detain you while they investigate. You can ask an agent for their basis for detaining you, and they should tell you.
The longer CBP detains you the more suspicion they need — eventually they will need probable cause once the detention goes from brief to prolonged. If the agent arrests you or searches the interior of your belongings, they need probable cause that you committed an offense. You can ask the agent to tell you their basis for probable cause, and they should be able to articulate their suspicion.

How does this work in real life?: CBP at Immigration Checkpoints
CBP operates immigration checkpoints along the interior of the United States at both major roads — permanent checkpoints — and secondary roads — “tactical checkpoints”— as part of its enforcement strategy. Depending on the checkpoint, there may be cameras installed throughout and leading up to the checkpoint and drug-sniffing dogs stationed with the agents. At these checkpoints, every motorist is stopped and asked about their immigration status. Agents do not need any suspicion to stop you and ask you questions at a lawful checkpoint, but their questions should be brief and related to verifying immigration status. They can also visually inspect your vehicle. Some motorists will be sent to secondary inspection areas at the checkpoint for further questioning. This should be done only to ask limited and routine questions about immigration status that cannot be asked of every motorist in heavy traffic. If you find yourself at an immigration checkpoint while you are driving, never flee from it — it’s a felony.
As before, when you are at a checkpoint, you can remain silent, inform the agent that you decline to answer their questions or tell the agent you will only answer questions in the presence of an attorney. Refusing to answer the agent’s question will likely result in being further detained for questioning, being referred to secondary inspection, or both. If an agent extends the stop to ask questions unrelated to immigration enforcement or extends the stop for a prolonged period to ask about immigration status, the agent needs at least reasonable suspicion that you committed an immigration offense or violated federal law for their actions to be lawful. If you are held at the checkpoint for more than brief questioning, you can ask the agent if you are free to leave. If they say no, they need reasonable suspicion to continue holding you. You can ask an agent for their basis for reasonable suspicion, and they should tell you. If an agent arrests you, detains you for a protracted period or searches your belongings or the spaces of your vehicle that are not in plain view of the officer, the agent needs probable cause that you committed an immigration offense or that you violated federal law. You can ask the agent to tell you their basis for probable cause. They should inform you.

How does this work in real life?: CBP Roving Patrols
CBP conducts yet another interior enforcement activity: roving patrols. During these patrols, CBP drives around the interior of the U.S. pulling motorists over. For these operations, the Supreme Court requires CBP to have reasonable suspicion that the driver or passengers in the car they pulled over committed an immigration violation or a federal crime. If they do pull you over, an agent’s questions should be limited to the suspicion they had for pulling you over and the agents should not prolong the stop for questioning unrelated to the purpose of the stop. Any arrest or prolonged stop requires probable cause. You may ask the agent their basis for probable cause, and they should tell you. In this situation, both the driver and any passengers have the right to remain silent and not answer questions about their immigration status.

CBP Advances US Trade Enforcement, Facilitation
Release Date Wed, 02/28/2018
Agency marks the second anniversary of key legislation.
WASHINGTON – U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) continues to make progress in implementing the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) on the Act’s two year anniversary. TFTEA, the first comprehensive authorization of CBP since the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2003, reshapes, strengthens and modernizes how CBP accomplishes its trade mission. The Act supports CBP’s continuing efforts to ensure a fair and competitive trade environment for American businesses and the American people.
“Since its enactment two years ago, implementing the provisions of TFTEA has been a top priority for CBP,” said Acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. “CBP has made significant progress in our efforts to protect American consumers and businesses from fraudulent trade activities while ensuring the swift flow of legitimate, fair, and safe imports entering the U.S. stream of commerce.”
With its additional TFTEA authorities, CBP continues to investigate unfair trade practices. Title IV, Section 421, commonly referred to as the Enforce and Protect Act of 2015, or EAPA, established formal procedures for the investigation of antidumping or countervailing duty evasion allegations against U.S. importers. Since August 2017, when EAPA came into force, CBP has initiated 16 investigations, preventing the evasion of more than $45 million in antidumping and countervailing duties annually.
CBP has used the additional authorities provided under TFTEA to prohibit the entry of goods made by forced labor, including forced child labor, into the United States and also established a Forced Labor Division within the Office of Trade. CBP seized more than 10,000 cartons of frozen squid, valued at more than $200,000, in November 2017 that was processed with North Korean forced labor. To date, CBP, in collaboration with its interagency partners, including the Department of Labor, which compiles lists of goods that are likely produced by forced labor, has detained 57 shipments of goods, valued at $6.3 million, that are suspected of involving forced labor.
CBP has also implemented a new mechanism to protect Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), enabling owners of unregistered copyrights whose application for registration is pending with the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) to record their online application with CBP at https://iprr.cbp.gov. Once recorded, unregistered copyrights receive the same benefits of border protection and enforcement as copyrights that are registered with the USCO. Furthermore, exercising its new authority under TFTEA to partner with the private sector, CBP announced a partnership this month with Procter & Gamble (P&G) as part of the Donations Acceptance Program. P&G donated testing devices to be used by CBP officers to prevent counterfeit P&G products from entering the United States.
“TFTEA provides CBP with new tools, authorities and opportunities for private sector collaboration,” said Brenda Smith, Executive Assistant Commissioner (EAC) for CBP’s Office of Trade. “The Act strengthens CBP’s enforcement and facilitation efforts to address current trade risks and aligns our operations with today’s complex business environment.”
CBP’s collaboration with its government and private sector partners is a key component of its trade strategy. CBP works closely with the CBP Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC), a long-standing advisory committee authorized by TFTEA, which consists of representatives from various sectors of the trade community including brokers, importers, exporters, and carriers. Furthermore, with TFTEA authorization, CBP has continued to enhance its industry-centric approach to trade enforcement through CBP’s Centers of Excellence and Expertise (Centers) and deepen its trade expertise through CBP’s industry seminar programs.
CBP continues to advance its efforts to streamline and modernize its business processes and practices through the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE)—the backbone of the U.S. Government’s “Single Window” system of imports and exports. As authorized by the TFTEA legislation, CBP raised the de minimis value from $200 to $800 and adjusted the threshold in ACE to reduce the costs associated with importing low valued shipments. CBP also recently deployed TFTEA drawback, enabling an automated approach for U.S. manufacturers and businesses to obtain import-paid duty, tax, and fee refunds on exported goods.
CBP will continue to implement provisions of TFTEA and leverage all available tools, authorities, and partnerships to increase trade enforcement, facilitate lawful trade, protect economic security and address the risks and challenges of 21st century trade operations.
For additional information on CBP’s progress in implementing TFTEA, visit CBP.gov. Interviews with EAC Smith on CBP’s focus on TFTEA, TFTEA’s impact on CBP/Trade relationship, TFTEA - Enforce and Protect Act, and Forced Labor are available on CBP’s TFTEA - Forced Labor YouTube channel.
  U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between the official ports of entry. CBP is charged with keeping terrorists and terrorist weapons out of the country while enforcing hundreds of U.S. laws.

FACT SHEET
The End of Immigration Enforcement Priorities Under the Trump Administration
Immigration 101History of ImmigrationEnforcementBorder EnforcementInterior Enforcement
Published:

with Citations
Enforcement of U.S. immigration laws has historically been guided by policies that emphasize prioritization. However, this practice has largely been abandoned since the inauguration of President Donald Trump.
This fact sheet explains the shift in enforcement philosophy under the Trump administration and outlines the effects of this change. The get-tough approach to enforcement—portrayed by the administration as an attempt to “restore the rule of law”—in effect diverts the attention of law-enforcement agencies from those who have committed serious crimes and those who are serious public threats.
Enforcement Without Priorities
Whereas prior policies outlined a framework for prioritizing U.S. resources—such as emphasizing the removal of persons convicted of serious crimes—the Trump administration expanded “enforcement priorities” so broadly as to render the term meaningless.  As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stated in a year-end report, ICE no longer exempts groups of removable [noncitizens] from enforcement. In other words, all undocumented immigrants have become targets—even if they have lived in the United States for many years, have U.S.-born children, and have never had a run-in with law enforcement.
The Trump administration laid out its enforcement priorities in the executive order, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” signed on January 25, 2017. The order defines as a priority any non-U.S. citizen who:
has been convicted of any criminal offense;
has been charged with any criminal offense, where the charge has not been resolved;
has committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;
has engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a government agency;
has abused any program related to the receipt of public benefits;
is subject to a final order of removal, but has not departed; or
otherwise poses, in the judgment of an immigration officer, a risk to public safety or national security. 
The subsequent Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memorandum implementing this executive order severely curtailed the ability of immigration-enforcement personnel to assess an individual’s equities when making case decisions. In the words of the memo: “prosecutorial discretion shall not be exercised in a manner that exempts or excludes a specified class or category of [noncitizens] from enforcement of the immigration laws.” Put differently, all DHS personnel “shall faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States against all removable [individuals].” 
A Look at the Numbers
This shift in enforcement philosophy has translated to more arrests and deportations of noncitizens. The increase is apparent in ICE statistics. Between January 25, 2017, and the end of fiscal year (FY) 2017 (September 30, 2017), ICE made 110,568 arrests—a 42 percent increase over the 77,806 arrests made during the same period in 2016. 
More detailed ICE statistics require a closer look. Specifically, ICE grouped together those convicted of crimes and those only charged with crimes when totaling arrests made between January 25 and September 30, 2017. As a result, ICE reported that 92 percent of arrests during that period were of individuals who either had criminal convictions or criminal charges pending final disposition. 
In addition to the problematic accounting that results from combining convictions and charges, the term “criminal” is defined very broadly. For instance, the largest numbers of convictions or charges pending were for non-violent crimes—traffic offenses, immigration offenses (such as unlawful entry or reentry into the country), and drug offenses (including possession). In addition, roughly 1 in 10 individuals arrested during FY 2017 had neither criminal convictions nor criminal charges pending. 
Exercising Discretion: 1996 to 2017
One of the crucial mechanisms in the enforcement of U.S. immigration law and criminal law is the exercise of discretion—and not just prosecutorial discretion. At the broadest level, discretion refers to the decision by a law-enforcement officer, prosecutor, or some other government official to pursue (or not pursue) the enforcement of certain laws against a person, or group of people, who may have violated those laws.
Discretion comes into play at every juncture of the law-enforcement process. In the criminal justice system, police decide whether to arrest someone; prosecutors decide if they should bring charges against that person; and judges decide what punishment to hand down to an individual who has been convicted. 
Discretion is critical to ensuring the criminal justice system functions properly. This is due in large part to the limited availability of resources. There simply aren’t enough police, prosecutors, and other criminal-justice personnel to act against every person who may have violated any one of the hundreds of thousands of laws on the books, no matter how minor. Given this limitation, the most rational use of law-enforcement resources is to prioritize more serious offenses over relatively minor ones. Other factors also enter into the equation when deciding whether to exercise discretion, such as how strong the evidence is against the accused, whether the accused has a prior criminal history, and how cooperative the accused is in assisting authorities with other investigations or prosecutions. 
For the most part, the discretionary considerations applicable in criminal law also apply in immigration law. Although immigration laws are civil in nature, the stakes remain high since penalties for violations can be extremely harsh—including long-term or lifetime banishment from the United States. Federal prosecutors commonly threaten criminal charges to get an immigrant to agree to voluntarily depart and avoid being placed in deportation proceedings. In fact, deportation often occurs even if criminal charges are dropped.
How 1996 Legislation Changed Discretion
Immigrants are almost certain to be prosecuted after arrest in large part because U.S. immigration law has taken much of the discretionary power away from prosecutors and judges. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), both passed in 1996, immigrants—even lawful permanent residents (LPRs)—may be subject to mandatory detention and deportation for an offense which Congress defines as an “aggravated felony” for immigration purposes. An “aggravated felony” can encompass offenses ranging from shoplifting to murder and, for non-citizens, is applied retroactively even in cases where the offense in question was committed long before it was added to the list of aggravated felonies. 
Discretion under the Obama Administration
The Obama administration did exercise some measure of discretion in its approach to immigration enforcement. This was apparent in what became known as the “Morton memo”—a June 30, 2010, memo from then-ICE Director John Morton. The purpose of the guidance was to establish priorities that immigration officers should follow in deciding who to apprehend, detain, and deport. To this end, the memo defined three priority levels:
threats to national security or public safety, including most migrants with criminal convictions of any kind;
undocumented migrants who recently crossed the border; and
migrants who didn’t heed a previous order of removal, or who re-entered the country after being deported.
While the Morton memo did represent an effort to create a rational set of enforcement priorities, it missed the mark. The single biggest problem with the hierarchy of priorities was that it lumped together offenses which are very different in nature. For instance, someone could be in Priority 1 for being a terrorist or for having committed an “aggravated felony” like shoplifting, which is neither a felony nor aggravated under criminal law as it is applied to U.S. citizens. Likewise, Priority 2 and 3 offenders likely included individuals who, for a variety of reasons, didn’t even realize that they had violated immigration laws. Even though the Morton memo offered little explicit guidance on prosecutorial discretion per se, it did single out lawful permanent residents (LPRs), juveniles, and the immediate family of U.S. citizens for special consideration. 
A subsequent pair of memoranda from then-Director Morton, both dated June 17, 2011, offered more specific guidance on the exercise of discretion. The primary memo on the use of prosecutorial discretion outlined the government’s explicit immigration enforcement priorities; it further stated that any potentially deportable immigrant encountered by immigration authorities should be assessed on the basis of length of time in the United States, presence in the country since a very young age, education, military service, social ties to the United States, and age. In addition, this memo emphasized that “particular care” be taken with cases involving veterans, long-time LPRs, children and elderly individuals, victims of domestic violence or trafficking, and people with serious health conditions. 
A November 2014 memo from then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson rescinded the Morton memos, articulating enforcement priorities applicable to the entire department rather than ICE alone. This detailed guidance similarly identified three civil immigration enforcement priorities:
threats to national security, border security (specifically those apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States), and public safety;
misdemeanants and new immigration violators (including anyone apprehended after unlawfully entering the United States and who had not been present in the United States since January 1, 2014); and
“other immigration” violators, namely those who had been issued a final order of removal on or after January 1, 2014. 
The Johnson memo also spelled out the many junctures at which discretion could be exercised in the immigration-enforcement process. According to the memo, prosecutorial discretion in the immigration context:
“should apply not only to the decision to issue, serve, file, or cancel a Notice to Appear, but also to a broad range of other discretionary enforcement decisions, including deciding: whom to stop, question, and arrest; whom to detain or release; whether to settle, dismiss, appeal, or join in a motion on a case; and whether to grant deferred action, parole, or a stay of removal instead of pursuing removal in a case.” 
This guidance was rescinded in February 2017 by then-DHS Secretary John Kelly. The Kelly memo, “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest,” greatly limited the exercise of discretion by immigration officials under the Trump administration. 
The Human Cost
This shift away from enforcement priorities and into blind enforcement is socially destructive. At the most pragmatic level, it wastes finite law-enforcement resources on the apprehension and removal of people who represent no danger to public safety. More than that, immigration enforcement without priorities needlessly tears apart U.S. society itself. U.S. families, communities, and workplaces include immigrants and native-born citizens alike.
Undocumented immigrants—and legal immigrants who committed relatively minor crimes—cannot be neatly skimmed from the surface of society and expelled from the country. Many are parents, often to U.S.-born children who attend U.S. schools. In fact, of the 5.1 million children who have at least one undocumented parent, 4.1 million are native-born citizens. To attempt to remove all 11 million undocumented immigrants from our country’s social fabric, without prioritizing those who pose a danger, needlessly harms millions of other people who remain behind, regardless of where they were born.

PRESS RELEASE
Attorney General Announces Zero-Tolerance Policy for Criminal Illegal Entry
Friday, April 6, 2018
Share
For Immediate Release
Office of Public Affairs
Attorney General Jeff Sessions today notified all U.S. Attorney’s Offices along the Southwest Border of a new “zero-tolerance policy” for offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), which prohibits both attempted illegal entry and illegal entry into the United States by an alien. The implementation of the Attorney General’s zero-tolerance policy comes as the Department of Homeland Security reported a 203 percent increase in illegal border crossings from March 2017 to March 2018, and a 37 percent increase from February 2018 to March 2018—the largest month-to-month increase since 2011. 
  “The situation at our Southwest Border is unacceptable. Congress has failed to pass effective legislation that serves the national interest—that closes dangerous loopholes and fully funds a wall along our southern border. As a result, a crisis has erupted at our Southwest Border that necessitates an escalated effort to prosecute those who choose to illegally cross our border,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “To those who wish to challenge the Trump Administration’s commitment to public safety, national security, and the rule of law, I warn you: illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice. To the Department’s prosecutors, I urge you: promoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens. You play a critical part in fulfilling these goals, and I thank you for your continued efforts in seeing to it that our laws—and as a result, our nation—are respected.”
  On April 11, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a renewed commitment to criminal immigration enforcement. As part of that announcement, the Attorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors and directed them to prioritize the prosecution of certain criminal immigration offenses.
  Today’s zero-tolerance policy further directs each U.S. Attorney’s Office along the Southwest Border (i.e., Southern District of California, District of Arizona, District of New Mexico, Western District of Texas, and the Southern District of Texas) to adopt a policy to prosecute all Department of Homeland Security referrals of section 1325(a) violations, to the extent practicable.

Quick Guide to Border Enforcement Measures for Trademarks, Copyright, Geographical Indications and Registered Designs
Seizure on request (Lodgement of Notice)
If you are –
The owner or licensee of a registered trademark;
The owner or licensee of a copyright;
A producer or trader of goods identified by a registered geographical indication, or any association of such producers or traders; or
The owner or exclusive licensee of a registered design;
You may give the Director-General of Customs a written notice requesting the seizure of goods that are expected to be imported or exported, and suspected to infringe the trademark, copyright, geographical indication or registered design in question. You will have to provide sufficient information:
a) to identify the infringing goods;
b) to enable the Director-General of Customs to ascertain when and where the goods are expected to be imported or exported; and
c) to satisfy the Director-General of Customs that the goods are infringing.
Any such notice given to the Director-General of Customs is valid for the day the notice is given and another 59 days afterwards (i.e. for 60 days). Within this period, Singapore Customs will seize the identified goods if they are imported into, or to be exported from, Singapore. Once the goods have been seized, you and the importer or exporter of the goods will be informed of the seizure.
Once informed of the seizure, you will have to commence an action for infringement of the trademark, copyright, geographical indication or registered design, and notify the Director-General of Customs accordingly, within 10 working days after the date specified in the notice of seizure given by the Director-General of Customs. The time limit for initiating infringement action may be extended by a further 10 working days, upon request.
Ex-officio Seizure
Besides seizure on request, Singapore Customs may also seize copies or goods which are reasonably suspected to infringe a registered trademark, a copyright or a registered geographical indication, and that are imported into or to be exported from Singapore. Singapore Customs will inform the owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright or the proprietor or licensee of the registered trademark (“the right holder”), or the registrant of the registered geographical indication, as soon as practicable after the seizure.
The rights holder (for trademark or copyright), or the registrant, or any producer or trader of goods, or any association of such producers or traders (for geographical indication), may then request the Director-General of Customs to continue to detain the goods. To do so, they must
a) Provide written notice to Singapore Customs within 48 hours after the date of the notice of the seizure from Singapore Customs. Singapore Customs will respond with a notice to take action as soon as practicable
b) Subsequently commence an action for infringement of the trademark, copyright or geographical indication and notify the Director-General of Customs accordingly within 10 working days after the date specified in the notice to take action.
The time limit for initiating infringement action may be extended by a further 10 working days upon request.
Security Requirements
In addition to the above, the right holder (for trademark or copyright), or the registrant or any producer or trader of goods or any association of such producers or traders (for geographical indication) must provide a security that is sufficient:
a) To reimburse the Government of Singapore for any liability or reasonable expense it is likely to incur in relation to the seizure, storage and disposal of the goods; and
b) To pay such compensation as ordered by the court for loss suffered by the defendant if the infringement action is not taken or is dismissed or discontinued, or if the court decides there was no infringement.
The security may be given to cover (a) the current shipment only, or (b) the current shipment and any future shipments to be seized by Singapore Customs (an “annual security”). An annual security can cover up to 5 outstanding shipments (i.e. shipments detained by Singapore Customs for which the civil proceedings have not been concluded). If at any time the Director-General of Customs is of the opinion that the security given is insufficient, the person depositing the security shall top up the security accordingly.
Procedure for Giving Notice
To provide notice, please select and complete the appropriate form from the table below.
For Seizure on Request (Lodgement of Notice), written notice should be given using Trade Marks Form 1, Copyright Form 1, Geographical Indications Form 1, or Registered Designs Form.
Where the right holder or registrant has been notified by Singapore Customs that there has been Ex-Officio Seizure of goods, and they wish for Singapore Customs to continue to detain the goods, written notice should be given using Trade Marks Form 2, Copyright Form 2, or Geographical Indications Form 2.

DONALD J. TRUMP
45th President of the United States: 2017 ‐ 2021
Memorandum on Ending ""Catch and Release"" at the Border of the United States and Directing Other Enhancements to Immigration Enforcement
April 06, 2018
Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security
Subject: Ending ""Catch and Release"" at the Border of the United States and Directing Other Enhancements to Immigration Enforcement
Section 1. Purpose. (a) Human smuggling operations, smuggling of drugs and other contraband, and entry of gang members and other criminals at the border of the United States threaten our national security and public safety. The backlog of immigration-related cases in our administrative system is alarmingly large and has hindered the expeditious adjudication of outstanding cases. Border-security and immigration enforcement personnel shortages have become critical.
(b) In Executive Order 13767 of January 25, 2017 (Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements), I directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue new policy guidance regarding the appropriate and consistent use of detention authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the termination of the practice known as ""catch and release,"" whereby aliens are released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of our immigration laws. On February 20, 2017, the Secretary issued a memorandum taking steps to end ""catch and release"" practices. These steps have produced positive results. Still, more must be done to enforce our laws and to protect our country from the dangers of releasing detained aliens into our communities while their immigration claims are pending.
Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows:
Sec. 2. Ending ""Catch and Release"". (a) Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall submit a report to the President detailing all measures that their respective departments have pursued or are pursuing to expeditiously end ""catch and release"" practices. At a minimum, such report shall address the following:
(i) All measures taken pursuant to section 5(a) of Executive Order 13767 to allocate all legally available resources to construct, operate, control, or modify—or establish contracts to construct, operate, control, or modify—facilities to detain aliens for violations of immigration law at or near the borders of the United States;
(ii) All measures taken pursuant to section 5(b) of Executive Order 13767 to assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations and reasonable fear determinations;
(iii) All measures taken pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13767 to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law; (iv) All measures taken pursuant to section 11(a) of Executive Order 13767 to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens;
(v) All measures taken pursuant to section 11(b) of Executive Order 13767 to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with those provisions;
(vi) All measures taken pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13768 of January 25, 2017 (Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States), to ensure the assessment and collection of all authorized fines and penalties from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their unlawful presence in the United States;
(vii) A detailed list of all existing facilities, including military facilities, that could be used, modified, or repurposed to detain aliens for violations of immigration law at or near the borders of the United States; and
(viii) The number of credible fear and reasonable fear claims received, granted, and denied—broken down by the purported protected ground upon which a credible fear or reasonable fear claim was made—in each year since the beginning of fiscal year 2009.
(b) Within 75 days of the date of this memorandum, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall submit a report to the President identifying any additional resources or authorities that may be needed to expeditiously end ""catch and release"" practices.
Sec. 3. Return of Removable Aliens to Their Home Countries or Countries of Origin. Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to the President detailing all measures, including diplomatic measures, that are being pursued against countries that refuse to expeditiously accept the repatriation of their nationals. The report shall include all measures taken pursuant to section 12 of Executive Order 13768 to implement the sanctions authorized by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), or a detailed explanation as to why such sanctions have not yet been imposed.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
(d) The Secretary of State is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
DONALD J. TRUMP

DONALD J. TRUMP
45th President of the United States: 2017 ‐ 2021
Memorandum on Ending ""Catch and Release"" at the Border of the United States and Directing Other Enhancements to Immigration Enforcement
April 06, 2018
Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security
Subject: Ending ""Catch and Release"" at the Border of the United States and Directing Other Enhancements to Immigration Enforcement
Section 1. Purpose. (a) Human smuggling operations, smuggling of drugs and other contraband, and entry of gang members and other criminals at the border of the United States threaten our national security and public safety. The backlog of immigration-related cases in our administrative system is alarmingly large and has hindered the expeditious adjudication of outstanding cases. Border-security and immigration enforcement personnel shortages have become critical.
(b) In Executive Order 13767 of January 25, 2017 (Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements), I directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue new policy guidance regarding the appropriate and consistent use of detention authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the termination of the practice known as ""catch and release,"" whereby aliens are released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of our immigration laws. On February 20, 2017, the Secretary issued a memorandum taking steps to end ""catch and release"" practices. These steps have produced positive results. Still, more must be done to enforce our laws and to protect our country from the dangers of releasing detained aliens into our communities while their immigration claims are pending.
Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows:
Sec. 2. Ending ""Catch and Release"". (a) Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall submit a report to the President detailing all measures that their respective departments have pursued or are pursuing to expeditiously end ""catch and release"" practices. At a minimum, such report shall address the following:
(i) All measures taken pursuant to section 5(a) of Executive Order 13767 to allocate all legally available resources to construct, operate, control, or modify—or establish contracts to construct, operate, control, or modify—facilities to detain aliens for violations of immigration law at or near the borders of the United States;
(ii) All measures taken pursuant to section 5(b) of Executive Order 13767 to assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations and reasonable fear determinations;
(iii) All measures taken pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13767 to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law; (iv) All measures taken pursuant to section 11(a) of Executive Order 13767 to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens;
(v) All measures taken pursuant to section 11(b) of Executive Order 13767 to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with those provisions;
(vi) All measures taken pursuant to section 6 of Executive Order 13768 of January 25, 2017 (Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States), to ensure the assessment and collection of all authorized fines and penalties from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their unlawful presence in the United States;
(vii) A detailed list of all existing facilities, including military facilities, that could be used, modified, or repurposed to detain aliens for violations of immigration law at or near the borders of the United States; and
(viii) The number of credible fear and reasonable fear claims received, granted, and denied—broken down by the purported protected ground upon which a credible fear or reasonable fear claim was made—in each year since the beginning of fiscal year 2009.
(b) Within 75 days of the date of this memorandum, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall submit a report to the President identifying any additional resources or authorities that may be needed to expeditiously end ""catch and release"" practices.
Sec. 3. Return of Removable Aliens to Their Home Countries or Countries of Origin. Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to the President detailing all measures, including diplomatic measures, that are being pursued against countries that refuse to expeditiously accept the repatriation of their nationals. The report shall include all measures taken pursuant to section 12 of Executive Order 13768 to implement the sanctions authorized by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), or a detailed explanation as to why such sanctions have not yet been imposed.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
(d) The Secretary of State is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

In-Bond Regulatory Changes Frequently Asked Questions
Printer-friendly version
On November 27, 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published a final rule entitled Changes to the In-Bond Process. The final rule adopted, with several changes, proposed amendments to CBP regulations regarding the in-bond process.
The in-bond process allows imported merchandise to be entered at one U.S. port of entry without appraisement or payment of duties and transported by a bonded carrier to another U.S. port of entry or other authorized destination provided all statutory and regulatory conditions are met. At the destination port, the merchandise is entered or exported. The changes in this rule, will enhance CBP’s ability to regulate and track in-bond merchandise and ensure that in-bond merchandise is properly entered or exported.
To assist all parties in understanding the expectations of CBP concerning these changes, CBP is providing guidance in the form of frequently asked questions. CBP will continual to update this document as necessary. Should you have additional questions, please forward them to cscwarehousing@cbp.dhs.gov. Please note that the responses to the FAQs are for informational purposes only and are non-binding. Questions relating to specific facts and circumstances of a prospective transaction can be the subject of a ruling request under Part 177 of the CBP regulations.
A transportation entry may be filed by: (1) The carrier, or authorized agent of the carrier, that brings the merchandise to the origination port; (2) The carrier, or authorized agent of the carrier, that is to accept the merchandise under its bond or a carnet for transportation to the port of destination or the port of exportation; or (3) Any person or the authorized agent of any person, who has a sufficient interest in the merchandise as shown by the bill of lading or manifest, a certificate of the importing carrier (such as a power of attorney or letter of authorization), or by any other document. CBP may request evidence to demonstrate sufficient interest.
An electronic in-bond application is required for in-bond merchandise transported by ocean, rail and truck. The methods available to submit an in-bond application are the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or QP/ WP. QP/WP is an ABI hosted in-bond system that allows all parties, carriers and non-carriers, to submit electronic in-bond applications directly to CBP, as well as report their arrival and export. The ‘‘QP’’ half is the application function, the ‘‘WP’’ half is the arrival/export function. ACE can be used to file the in-bond application in conjunction with advance or arriving manifest information. For in-bond merchandise transported by air, carriers can file the in-bond application also using ACE or QP/WP.
FAQs
What are the major changes in the updated in-bond regulations?
What about the air commerce regulations found in 19 CFR part 122?
CBP mentioned a 90 day enforcement period for this regulatory change. Are there key dates established for enforcement?
What about local port policy regarding in-bond procedures?
If I am filing an in-bond transaction for a Customs Bonded Warehouse (CBW), Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) or Vessel/Aircraft Supply withdrawal for export or re-warehouse am I required to file electronically. If yes, am I still required to supply paper?
The final rule at §18.1(j) states that the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) report of arrival must be filed with CBP within two business days after the arrival of “any portion of an in-bond shipment” at the port of destination or exportation.
What is the process for a diversion request and who is monitoring those diversions?
Some agriculture commodities are not permitted to divert to other locations. Will the system automatically reject those diversions? If not, will an Agriculture specialist be required to approve/deny the request?
What port handles the diversion request? The arrival, the destination port or the new destination port? Originating port where the in-bond was filed?
For sealed containers carrying in-transit merchandise, does this mean that the bonded carrier will no longer have to request CBP approval to break the seals to trans-load?
When can the Trade expect publication of the new In-bond (QP) CATAIR programming specifications as well as the Truck Manifest ANSI-X12 and UN EDIFACT message sets?
Confirm that the system will accept both the 6-and 10-digit HTS number, at the importer’s discretion.
Confirm that the carrier remains responsible for reporting the arrival of the in-bond within 2 business days.
If an exporter uses QP to file an in-bond, obligating the carrier's custodial bond, (including air shipments), does this obligate the carrier to close the in-bond electronically in QP?
When will the ACE Portal be programmed to allow the party whose custodial bond is obligated (not the carrier who manifested the shipment into the USA) to have visibility to and close out the in-bond via the Portal? If not, what is the interim solution?
Why does CBP expect the carrier to know the description in sufficient details to ascertain if PGA’s have jurisdiction?
What is the exact message, acknowledging approval to divert the in-bond?
Will CBP compare the ISF 6-digit HTS codes to the in-bond 6-digit HTS?
Will PGA's have visibility (or do they currently have visibility) to in-bond transactions? In collaboration with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)?

Schengen, borders and visa
Border crossing
Border crossing
The abolition of internal border controls cannot come at the expense of security. Since no checks are carried out at the borders between Schengen Member States, EU countries have decided to join forces to attain the objective of improving security through efficient external border controls, while still facilitating access of persons who have a legitimate interest to enter the EU territory.
Schengen Borders Code
The Schengen Borders Code
provides EU countries with a single set of common rules that govern external border checks on persons, entry requirements and duration of short stays in the Schengen Area
.
The Practical Handbook for Border Guards
provides practical guidance primarily to border guards, competent national authorities and operators, but also to interested citizens, concerning the practical implementation of the Schengen Border Code. The Commission has adopted an update of the Handbook on 28 October 2022.
Short-stay visas
Through the Visa Code
, EU countries have harmonised conditions and procedures for issuing short-stay visas (visas for stays which do not exceed three months). A separate regulation
establishes a list of countries whose citizens are subject to a visa requirement when entering the EU and a list of countries for which this requirement is waived (long-stay visas and residence permits for visits exceeding three months remain subject to national conditions).
Duration of short-stay visas
The short-stay visa calculator
can be used for calculating the period of allowed stay under the rules
The user's guide
contains information on the rules, the use of the calculator and practical examples
The Visa Code rules do not apply to the visa waiver agreement concluded between the EU and Brazil, with respect to which the old definition
(3 months during a 6 months period following the date of first entry) continues to apply.
The length of stay of non-EU citizens traveling with a visa issued in accordance with the visa facilitation agreements
concluded by the EU and certain third countries is to be calculated according to the calculation method, since in these agreements there is a reference to ""90 days per period of 180 days"".
Local border traffic regime
A local border traffic regime
established for border residents who frequently need to cross the external borders of the Union. It enables EU States to conclude bilateral agreements with their neighbouring non-EU countries so that the border residents can travel back and forth without a Schengen visa and, therefore, without any impediment to trade, social and cultural interchange in the region concerned.
Entry/Exit System
In November 2017, the Commission adopted a Regulation for the establishment of an Entry/Exit System
(annex) and an amendment to the Schengen Borders Code to integrate the technical changes needed for the Entry/Exit System
(annex
).
Solidarity and cooperation
EU Internal Security Fund
All EU countries have to make investments to protect their external borders in the interest of the entire Schengen Area. For some countries, notably those situated at the external frontiers of the Union, these investments can be very high due to particular migratory pressures. The EU Internal Security Fund establishes solidarity between the Schengen Member States by supporting those countries with a heavy financial burden in implementing the common standards on external border controls.
Frontex
Operational cooperation between EU States is coordinated by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). The major task of Frontex is to coordinate joint operations to assist EU States in managing migratory flows at their external borders.
The joint operations at sea coordinated by Frontex are governed by Regulation EU/656/2014
, which establishes rules on interception, rescue and disembarkation to be applied in the context of such joint operations.
The Agency also manages a pool of border guards called European Border Guard Teams for deployment as guest officers during Frontex joint operations and pilot projects, and during rapid interventions in EU countries facing urgent and exceptional pressures at their external borders.
EUROSUR
The EU established a new information sharing and cooperation mechanism called EUROSUR
(European Border Surveillance System). This mechanism provides Schengen countries with a common operational and technical framework, which assists them in countering cross-border crime, preventing unauthorized border crossings and diminishing the tragic death tolls of migrants at sea.

CBP Policy on Nondiscrimination in Law Enforcement Activities and all other Administered Programs
It is the policy of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prohibit the consideration of race or ethnicity in law enforcement, investigation, and screening activities, in all but the most exceptional circumstances. As such, CBP is fully committed to the fair, impartial and respectful treatment of all members of the trade and traveling public.
On April 26, 2013, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a policy on “Nondiscriminatory Law Enforcement and Screening Activities.” The DHS policy defines “racial profiling” as the invidious use of race or ethnicity as a criterion in conducting stops, searches, and other law enforcement, investigation, or screening activities. The policy notes “racial profiling is premised on the erroneous assumption that any particular individual of one race or ethnicity is more likely to engage in misconduct than any particular individual of another race or ethnicity.”
Consistent with the DHS policy, CBP personnel may use race or ethnicity when a compelling governmental interest is present and its use is narrowly tailored to that interest. National security is per se a compelling interest, but use of race and ethnicity to serve compelling interest must still be narrowly tailored. Race or ethnicity-based information that is specific to particular suspects or incidents or ongoing criminal activities, schemes, or enterprises may be considered. These standards are designed to ensure that racial and ethnic stereotypes will not be used in conducting stops, searches and other law enforcement activities, but that law enforcement officers rely on specific and trustworthy information to make law enforcement decisions.

Those principles relate to the consideration of race or ethnicity, which is distinguished from the consideration of nationality. Using nationality for anti terrorism, customs, or immigration activities in which nationality is expressly relevant to the administration or enforcement of a statute, regulation, or executive order to trigger screening, inspection, or investigative steps is entirely appropriate and needs no further justification.
In addition, this policy does not in any way limit the individualized discretionary use of nationality as a screening, investigation, or enforcement factor. Therefore, the use of nationality is appropriate for the vast majority of situations encountered by front-line CBP personnel and those supporting them in their day to day operations.

In circumstances outside the context of front-line CBP operations and work in support thereof, if nationality is not expressly relevant, DHS and CBP policy is to use nationality as an investigative or screening criterion only in situations where such consideration is based on an assessment of intelligence and risk and in which alternatives do not meet security needs and only as long as necessary.
The use of race and ethnicity information in violation of this policy may subject CBP employees to discipline under the Standards of Conduct. All employees are reminded of their obligation to report misconduct, including discriminatory treatment toward members of the public in the conduct of official duties and unlawful profiling by:

CBP Policy on Nondiscrimination in Law Enforcement Activities and all other Administered Programs
It is the policy of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prohibit the consideration of race or ethnicity in law enforcement, investigation, and screening activities, in all but the most exceptional circumstances. As such, CBP is fully committed to the fair, impartial and respectful treatment of all members of the trade and traveling public.
On April 26, 2013, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a policy on “Nondiscriminatory Law Enforcement and Screening Activities.” The DHS policy defines “racial profiling” as the invidious use of race or ethnicity as a criterion in conducting stops, searches, and other law enforcement, investigation, or screening activities. The policy notes “racial profiling is premised on the erroneous assumption that any particular individual of one race or ethnicity is more likely to engage in misconduct than any particular individual of another race or ethnicity.”
Consistent with the DHS policy, CBP personnel may use race or ethnicity when a compelling governmental interest is present and its use is narrowly tailored to that interest. National security is per se a compelling interest, but use of race and ethnicity to serve compelling interest must still be narrowly tailored. Race or ethnicity-based information that is specific to particular suspects or incidents or ongoing criminal activities, schemes, or enterprises may be considered. These standards are designed to ensure that racial and ethnic stereotypes will not be used in conducting stops, searches and other law enforcement activities, but that law enforcement officers rely on specific and trustworthy information to make law enforcement decisions.

Those principles relate to the consideration of race or ethnicity, which is distinguished from the consideration of nationality. Using nationality for anti terrorism, customs, or immigration activities in which nationality is expressly relevant to the administration or enforcement of a statute, regulation, or executive order to trigger screening, inspection, or investigative steps is entirely appropriate and needs no further justification.
In addition, this policy does not in any way limit the individualized discretionary use of nationality as a screening, investigation, or enforcement factor. Therefore, the use of nationality is appropriate for the vast majority of situations encountered by front-line CBP personnel and those supporting them in their day to day operations.

In circumstances outside the context of front-line CBP operations and work in support thereof, if nationality is not expressly relevant, DHS and CBP policy is to use nationality as an investigative or screening criterion only in situations where such consideration is based on an assessment of intelligence and risk and in which alternatives do not meet security needs and only as long as necessary.
The use of race and ethnicity information in violation of this policy may subject CBP employees to discipline under the Standards of Conduct. All employees are reminded of their obligation to report misconduct, including discriminatory treatment toward members of the public in the conduct of official duties and unlawful profiling by:

FOX News: Better border security and immigration enforcement is on the way
August 15, 2017
Op-Eds
By: Reps. McCaul and Goodlatte
Over the last six months the Trump administration has made good on its promise to enhance border security and enforce our immigration laws. In the first half of 2017, illegal border crossings fell by an estimated 70%. It is very reassuring to know that President Obama's reckless immigration policies are now over. An Executive Branch that is dedicated to fixing the problems along our southern border and actually enforcing our laws not only deters future illegal immigration, but is also absolutely necessary to protecting our homeland.
However, we are constantly reminded that our borders and our immigration laws are still being exploited, including by those who are intent on doing Americans harm. For example, MS-13, a violent transnational gang controlled by members in El Salvador, has aggressively recruited minors who entered illegally at our southern border during recent surges of illegal immigration. Known for its brutal tactics of rape, theft, and homicide, this gang now has tens of thousands of members in cities all across the United States.
These dangers are not always brought on by transnational gangs however. In late July, a sixty-five-year-old woman from Portland, Oregon was assaulted by an illegal immigrant armed with a knife. The assailant had been previously deported over a dozen times. How did this man keep sneaking into our country and why are some localities undermining the enforcement of our immigration laws and their communities' safety?
Further, nine illegal immigrants were recently found dead in a sweltering tractor-trailer parked outside of a Walmart in Texas. Tragically, dozens more were sent to a nearby hospital; some with life threating conditions. They were the victims of a heinous human smuggling operation.
Human smugglers, violent criminals, drug smugglers, and international terrorists continue to do everything they can to break into America, creep into our neighborhoods, and take advantage of our society. This is completely unacceptable. We cannot be a safe nation if we have porous borders and our laws are not being fully enforced. We must tackle these problems head on.
Fortunately, we have introduced two important pieces of legislation in the House of Representatives that work together as a united front to strengthen our border security, strengthen the enforcement of our immigration laws, and provide the Department of Homeland Security with the personnel and resources it needs to get the job done.
The Judiciary Committee has passed Representative Raùl Labrador's Davis-Oliver Act, named for two law enforcement officers from California who were killed by an illegal immigrant. This legislation removes the ability of any future President to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement by empowering state and local authorities to help enforce our immigration laws. State and local authorities are the front line in the fight against crime and encounter criminals every day in their communities. We must ensure that they are able to identify the drug dealers, murderers, drunk drivers, and spouse-abusers who are illegally present and work with federal immigration enforcement authorities to ensure their punishment and removal.
The legislation also withholds certain federal grants from jurisdictions that illegally prohibit their officers from cooperating with ICE; allows victims of crimes by illegal aliens to sue localities in instances where the locality's refusal to cooperate with ICE facilitated the crime; makes membership in a gang a deportable offense; and calls for additional ICE officers to enforce our laws; among other important provisions. This legislation is a necessary step towards keeping our communities safe.
The Homeland Security Committee's Border Security for America Act, is a multi-layered approach that enhances the security of our southern border in a number of important ways.
Most notably, this bill authorizes the construction of a border wall and provides $15 billion for the deployment of tactical infrastructure, technology, and other measures to achieve full operational control and situational awareness. President Trump repeatedly said that a wall was an important part of securing our border and this legislation will help make that happen. However, a wall will not solve this problem by itself.
This legislation improves and modernizes ports of entry to target illegal immigration while enhancing trade, authorizes the National Guard to assist with aviation intelligence support, and will ensure identification of visa overstays by requiring implementation of the Entry-Exit system Congress enacted over two decades ago to track the entry and exit of foreign nationals visiting our country. It also provides more boots on the ground by adding 5,000 Border Patrol Agents and 5,000 Customs and Border Protection Officers. We can have strong walls, solid intelligence, and advanced technology, but our strongest asset in the fight to control our borders are the brave men and women who patrol our borders.
The American people have made it clear that they want to see their leaders implement policies that will protect their families and their neighborhoods. A weak border and immigration laws that can be easily circumvented only allow new dangers to enter our country and threaten our citizens. Let's work together and pass these common sense proposals that will better enforce our nation's immigration laws and provide all Americans the secure border they have long demanded and deserve.

S. 1199, Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017
August 17, 2017
Cost Estimate
As ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on July 26, 2017
View Document
90.15 KB
Summary
CBO estimates that, in total, implementing S. 1199 would cost about $1 million annually, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
S. 1199 would authorize Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to provide a danger-pay allowance for ICE agents who are assigned to certain overseas posts. ICE expects that 39 employees would receive this allowance and estimates that each person would earn, on average, an additional $13,600 per year; that amount is equivalent to 15 percent of their current pay, which is in line with other agencies that provide danger pay. Thus, CBO estimates that implementing this provision of the bill would cost about $530,000 in 2017, with those costs growing as average salaries increased over time.
In addition, S. 1199 would require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), for five years after enactment, to submit an annual report to the Congress on a DHS task force working to improve border security. The report would include an evaluation of the task force’s effectiveness in enhancing border security, reducing crime, and improving the sharing of information among law enforcement agencies. Based on the cost of similar activities, CBO estimates that the report would cost less than $500,000 annually over the next 5 years.
Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting S. 1199 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.
S. 1199 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.
On May 12, 2017, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 2281, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force Reauthorization Act of 2017, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on May 3, 2017. H.R. 2281 would require DHS to prepare a report similar to the one in S. 1199 but would not authorize danger pay for ICE agents. The estimates of the two versions of the bill reflect that difference.

Home Border Security At Ports of Entry Resource Optimization Strategy Public-Private Partnerships Donations Acceptance Program
Border Security
Donations Acceptance Program
The Donations Acceptance Program (DAP) is a partnership mechanism to collaboratively explore and implement tangible solutions to trade and travel facilitation and enforcement challenges. DAP is authorized to accept donations of real property, personal property, and non-personal services from private sector and government entities.
The DAP oversees two major partnership portfolios: Infrastructure/Personal Property and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) enforcement technology. The DAP was established in FY 2015 to explore, foster, and facilitate partnerships for port of entry infrastructure and technology improvements. The latter consists primarily of intellectual property rights enforcement partnerships aimed at protecting CBP's trade stakeholders and U.S. consumers from counterfeit and potentially unsafe goods.
On December 16, 2016, section 2 of the Cross-Border Trade Enhancement Act of 2016, P.L. 114-279, amended title IV of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to, among other things, add a new section 482, which jointly authorized CBP and GSA to accept real property, personal property, monetary, and non-personal services donations from private sector and government entities. Section 482 was further amended by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2022 (P.L. 117-81, Section 6410), signed into law on December 27, 2021, which expanded and extended CBP’s ability to implement this initiative authorizing CBP to continue to enter into partnerships in the form of donations of real property from private sector and government entities. See 6 U.S.C. 301a.
In addition, Section 308(d) of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA), P.L. 114-125 (2016), extended that authority to allow for the donation of tools for IPR enforcement. Title 19 Code of Federal Regulations § 133.61 prescribes the methods by which donations of IPR technology and related support services may be made. Specifically, Title 19 CFR 133.61(a) sets forth the scope of this section and identifies the authority to accept donations, § 133.61(b) describes the donation process, and § 133.61(c) lays out the elements of the written donation agreement.

Drug-related activity in Indian Country is a major contributor to violent crime and imposes serious health and economic difficulties on Indian communities. The BIA OJS conducts highly technical investigations on narcotics, gangs, border, and human trafficking violations in Indian Country through the Division of Drug Enforcement (DDE). DDE Special Agents work along side DDE K-9 teams and OJS General Crimes Special Agents and uniformed police officers in Indian Country daily. DDE Special Agents work alongside federal and tribal programs to disrupt narcotics sales and to disrupt criminal organizations who operate on Indian Lands and prey upon Indian communities.
BIA DDE provides complex narcotic investigations, as well as gang, and human trafficking investigations that focus on the disruption of drug distribution networks and criminal enterprise directly related to Indian Country and those impacting Indian Communities. The DDE provides analytical support to track drug cases, evaluate intelligence and trend data on drug related issues that impact Indian Country. DDE also provides drug related training and technical assistance to law enforcement programs operating in Indian Country. Trainings such as drug traffic interdiction, Spanish immersion, and basic & advance drug investigations courses are also being conducted. Many of these trainings are conducted at the agency level to make this training readily available to the tribes. DDE works on task forces with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Border Patrol as well as multiple state and tribal agencies across the United States.
Surveillance equipment has been purchased by the BIA and is issued through an Equipment Loan Program for use by the tribes to conduct drug investigations and this is able help in the collection of useful vital information from the field. Criteria for receiving the equipment consist of having an established drug investigations program. Data collected is more thorough than reporting numbers and will dive into the more detailed aspects of a seizure or arrest. This detailed approach allows for the development of a drug threat assessment and is provided to the tribes on a semi-annual basis. Also, the numbers are accessible to the tribes, so they can support their grant proposals should they seek funding opportunities.
The Division of Drug Enforcement funds several School Resource Officers (SRO) positions throughout Indian country. The SRO will provide anti-meth education to our youth through programs such as DARE and GREAT. The SRO also organizes anti-meth activities to bring awareness to the dangers of this drug to our students at an early age level, which encourages our youth to make wise choices and remain drug free.

OCTOBER 19, 2017
VAN HOLLEN, COLLEAGUES DEMAND DHS ANSWERS FOR REPORTED VIOLATIONS OF SENSITIVE LOCATIONS POLICY
U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) joined a group of 20 senators in writing Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke to seek answers about the Department's apparent violations of policies regarding immigration enforcement at sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, and religious institutions. In September,National Public Radio reportedthat the parents of a two-month-old baby were apprehended at a hospital while seeking lifesaving medical care for their son.
""We have heard reports of CBP and ICE agents apprehending undocumented immigrants in sensitive locations and other critical sites that provide basic services. Agents have reportedly arrested a father while he dropped off his children at school, a domestic violence victim at a courthouse, and a group of men exiting a church shelter, among others. These reports have generated fear in immigrant communities, leading some families to cancel medical appointments or not send their children to school,""the senators wrote.""Reports of instances that seem to violate the sensitive locations policy make it difficult for educators, health care providers, and program administrators to be able to assure families that their locations remain safe from immigration enforcement actions.""
The letter was led by U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and also signed by U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.),Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).
The full text of the senators' letter isavailable hereand copied below:
Dear Acting Secretary Duke:
We write to share our growing concerns over reports of violations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policies on enforcement actions at sensitive locations. We ask that your Department clarify its policies on sensitive locations and provide basic statistical data on compliance with them.
As you know, your Department has longstanding policies that prohibit enforcement actions at or near sensitive locations. In 2011, the then-ICE Director issued a memorandum,Enforcement Actions at or Focused on Sensitive Locations,that prohibits enforcement actions at or focused on a sensitive location unless exigent circumstances exist or prior approval is obtained.[1]Enforcement actions include arrests, interviews, searches, and immigration enforcement-related surveillance at or near locations such as hospitals, schools and places of worship, and sites used for religious ceremonies or public demonstrations. In 2013, the then-CBP Deputy Commissioner issued a similar memo,U.S. Customs and Border Protection Enforcement Actions at or Near Certain Community Locations.[2]Later, ICE and CBP issued FAQs to further clarify the types of locations that are considered ""sensitive"" to cover locations such as licensed daycares, school bus stops, accredited health clinics and urgent care facilities.[3]The memosdirect ICE and CBP officers and agents to follow these orders at all times, with the exception of cases where prior approval was obtained or under exigent circumstances.
However, since President Trump's issuance of Executive Order 13768,Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,and Executive Order 13767,Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,we have heard reports of CBP and ICE agents apprehending undocumented immigrants in sensitive locations and other critical sites that provide basic services. Agents have reportedly arrested a father while he dropped off his children at school, a domestic violence victim at a courthouse, and a group of men exiting a church shelter, among others.[4]These reports have generated fear in immigrant communities, leading some families to cancel medical appointments or not send their children to school.[5]Reports of instances that seem to violate the sensitive locations policy make it difficult for educators, health care providers, and program administrators to be able to assure families that their locations remain safe from immigration enforcement actions.
Most recently, we have been alarmed by the reported apprehension of Irma Francisca Quinones Alamillo and Oscar Enrique Sanchez Islas in May 2017.[6]According to the National Immigrant Justice Center, Mr. Sanchez Islas and Ms. Quinones Alamillo took their two-month-old baby to a hospital for pyloric stenosis, a serious condition that causes infants to vomit and lose weight. At the hospital, they were allegedly apprehended by a Border Patrol agent and later taken away for fingerprinting and booking.[7]
If these reports are true, they constitute an apparent breach of ICE and CBP rules, as well as the trust that our communities put in your Department. Given our concerns, we ask that you provide answers to the following questions within 30 days.
Sensitive Locations Statistics and Policy
Please provide the following ICE and CBP statistics on enforcement actions at or focused on sensitive locations, by year.(For ICE, please provide statistics from the policy's inception date of October 2011 to the present. For CBP, please provide statistics from the policy's inception date of January 2013 to the present.)
Number and location of enforcement actions at or focused on sensitive locations. Please note the actions that received prior approval or involved an exigent circumstance.
Number of recorded violations of the sensitive locations policy.
Who, if anyone, monitors compliance with the sensitive locations policy?
How are complaints about violations of the sensitive locations policy typically reported? Who investigates these complaints?
What is the standard procedure when an ICE or CBP officer or agent violates the sensitive locations policy?
What training do ICE and CBP officers receive on the sensitive locations policy? How often do they receive this training? Who conducts the training?
As part of the Department's outreach program with local organizations, does the Department enlist help from hospitals, schools, or other institutions defined as sensitive locations to report undocumented immigrants who appear on their premises?
Irma Francisca Quinones Alamillo & Oscar Enrique Sanchez Islas' Case
Did the Border Patrol agents seek and receive supervisory approval to question these parents at the hospital? Was this questioning an ""enforcement action""?
Did agents violate CBP's sensitive locations policy when they apprehended Irma Francisca Quinones Alamillo and Oscar Enrique Sanchez Islas at the hospital? If so, what are the ramifications?
Was the option, reported in theNew York Timestwo years ago, of obtaining ""short-term visas or so-called humanitarian parole to travel beyond [checkpoints]""[1]available and communicated to the parents?
After reviewing the incident, do you believe that CBP should have done anything differently?
In 2013, then-CBP Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar wrote that enforcement actions are generally prohibited ""at or near"" sensitive locations. How does the CBP define ""near""? For instance, would the parking lot of a hospital be considered ""near"" a sensitive location?
In the same memo, Mr. Aguilar writes that the sensitive locations policy ""does not limit or otherwise apply to CBP operations that are conducted at or near the international border."" How does CBP define ""near the international border""? Does the Rio Grande Valley hospital, where a Border Patrol agent apprehended Mr. Sanchez Islas and Ms. Quinones Alamillo, fall under this definition?
We look forward to your timely response, and urge the Department to monitor and enforce compliance with ICE and CBP sensitive locations policy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
For too long, the policy debate over border enforcement has been split between those who believe the border can be sealed against illegal entry by force alone, and those who believe that any effort to do so is futile and without expanded legal work opportunities. And for too long, both sides have been able to muster evidence to make their cases — the enforcers pointing to targeted successes at sealing the border, and the critics pointing to continued illegal entry despite the billions spent on enforcement. Until recently it has been hard to referee the disputes with any confidence because the data was simply inadequate — both sides could muster their preferred measures to make their case. But improvements in both data and analysis are increasingly making it possible to offer answers to the critical question of the effectiveness of border enforcement in stopping and deterring illegal entry.
The new evidence suggests that unauthorized migration across the southern border has plummeted, with successful illegal entries falling from roughly 1.8 million in 2000 to just 200,000 by 2015. Border enforcement has been a significant reason for the decline — in particular, the growing use of “consequences” such as jail time for illegal border crossers has had a powerful effect in deterring repeated border crossing efforts. The success of deterrence through enforcement has meant that attempted crossings have fallen dramatically even as the likelihood of a border crosser being apprehended by the Border Patrol has only risen slightly, to just over a 50-50 chance.
These research advances should help to inform a more rational public debate over the incremental benefits of additional border enforcement expenditures. With Congress gearing up to consider budget proposals from the Trump administration that seek an additional $2.6 billion for border security, including construction of new physical barriers, the debate is long overdue. In particular, Congress should be taking a careful look at the incremental gains that might come from additional spending on border enforcement. The evidence suggests that deterrence through enforcement, despite its successes to date in reducing illegal entry across the border, is producing diminishing returns. There are three primary reasons. First, arrivals at the border are increasingly made up of asylum seekers from Central America rather than traditional economic migrants from Mexico; this is a population that is both harder to deter because of the dangers they face at home, and in many cases not appropriate to deter because the United States has legal obligations to consider serious requests for asylum. Second, the majority of additions to the US unauthorized population is now arriving on legal visas and then overstaying; enforcement at the southern border does nothing to respond to this challenge. And finally, among Mexican migrants, a growing percentage of the repeat border crossers are parents with children left behind in the United States, a population that is far harder to deter than young economic migrants.
The administration could better inform this debate by releasing to scholars and the public the research it has sponsored in order to give Americans a fuller picture on border enforcement.

What to Report to the DHS OIG Hotline
The DHS Office of Inspector General investigates fraud, waste, abuse, and criminal misconduct involving DHS programs, personnel, and funds. Examples of these types of violations include:
Border corruption
DHS employee criminal activity
Cybercrime
Misuse of classified information
Bribery and acceptance of gratuities
Conflicts of interest
Disaster and pandemic fraud involving DHS funds
Contract and procurement fraud
Whistleblower retaliation
What NOT to Report to the DHS OIG Hotline
The DHS OIG hotline is NOT an emergency services network. While complaints can be submitted to the DHS OIG hotline at any time, the hotline is not actively monitored 24 hours per day and complaints are generally processed in the order they are received. As such, if there is an immediate threat to life or safety, call 911. Do not use our hotline to report emergencies.
The DHS OIG hotline should not be used to report allegations that are unrelated to DHS or allegations that would be more appropriately addressed by entities other than DHS OIG. Direct links to specific offices for reporting some common issues are as follows:
Equal Employment Opportunity complaints, including discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, physical or mental disability, or protected genetic information, may be reported through the DHS EEO Complaint Process.
Immigration violations, including marriage fraud and individuals in the country without authorization, may be reported to ICE.
Medical questions or concerns related to detainees in ICE facilities may be reported to the ICE ERO Detention and Information Line at 1 (888) 351-4024.
Questions regarding visa or citizenship applications may be reported to the USCIS Ombudsperson.
Issues related to travel processing, including watchlist questions and denied entry issues, may be reported to the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) Office.
Submitting repeated complaints to DHS OIG regarding the same matter will not result in faster or additional action. Additionally, the DHS OIG hotline should not be used to submit links to news stories or complaints based solely on information derived from the news media.

The Truth Behind Counterfeits
The dangers of buying counterfeit products aren’t always obvious. There are economic impacts, legal implications, and health and safety risks that are important for you to know before you buy. Particularly, when shopping online, beware of counterfeit goods.  Fake goods can lead to real dangers.
  Economic Impacts
Each time you buy a counterfeit good, a legitimate company loses revenue. This translates to lost profits and the loss of U.S. jobs over time. Moreover, you work hard for your money and by buying from reputable sources, you help to guarantee that you are getting what you paid for.  Know who you buy from.
  Health and Safety
Many counterfeit products are low-quality and can cause injuries.  Protect yourself and your family by avoiding potentially risky items.

Legal Implications
It is illegal to purchase counterfeit goods.  Bringing them into the United States may result in civil or criminal penalties and purchasing counterfeit goods often supports criminal activities, such as forced labor or human trafficking.  Help to stop the funding of criminal enterprises by buying authentic goods.
E-Commerce 
E-Commerce sales have contributed to large volumes of low-value, small packages being imported into the United States. Over 90 percent of all counterfeit seizures occur in the international mail and express environments which are channels that small, e-commerce packages destined for U.S. addresses travel through. Many of these shipments contain counterfeit goods that pose the same health, safety, and economic security risks as large, containerized shipments.  Make sure to shop from reputable sources online.

Border Security
Cargo Examination
Historically, cargo entering the United States from any foreign territory has been subject to physical examination by the U.S. Government to verify that it complies with U.S. laws and regulations. After September 11, 2001, a new combined organization of Border Patrol, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Agriculture Inspection, and the U.S. Customs Service became Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the Department of Homeland Security. CBP now assumes a leading position in the defense of Homeland Security to protect the country against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction.
The CBP antiterrorism mission is not limited to the physical examination of cargo when it arrives in U.S. ports. CBP is also using intelligence from a number of sources to identify high-risk shipments in order to concentrate its inspectional resources on them. For example, under bilateral agreements as part of the Container Security Initiative, CBP inspectors work in nearly 20 foreign ports to help ensure the security of U.S.-bound cargo before it disembarks.
In addition, under the Trade Act of 2002, CBP will issue regulations providing for advanced electronic submission of cargo information for security purposes by October 2003.
Domestically, CBP is working with the thousands of companies who are members of the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism to emphasize security in the supply chain, so that CBP cargo examinations can be given even more selectively.
An important part of the CBP mission remains the facilitation of legitimate trade. In addition to its own regulations, CBP enforces over 400 laws on behalf of over 40 other U.S. Government agencies. A large number of these import restrictions and requirements are designed to protect the American people from dangerous and illegal goods. CBP has undertaken a number of initiatives, such as the use of non-intrusive inspection technology, to increase its ability to examine cargo effectively without slowing the flow of trade, which plays a significant part in the U.S. economy.

Fact Sheet: Executive Order: Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements
Release Date: February 21, 2017
February 21, 2017 8:30 a.m. EST
Office of the Press Secretary
Contact: 202-282-8010
Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the federal government, in cooperation with the states, to secure the nation's borders. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies to deploy all lawful means to secure the nation's southern border with Mexico, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.
This includes, among other provisions, establishing operational control of the border, establishing and controlling a physical barrier, detaining illegal aliens at or near the border, ending the practice of “catch and release,” and returning aliens to the territory from which they came pending formal proceedings.
This order also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to hire an additional 5,000 border agents and to empower state and local law enforcement to support federal enforcement of immigration law, to the maximum extent permitted by law, and to ensure that prosecution guidelines place a high priority on crimes having a nexus to our southern border.
Authorities
This executive order and its implementation is grounded in authorities vested in the President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109 367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104 208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), in furtherance of the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as responsibilities to ensure that the nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed.
Actions
Enforcing the law. Under this executive order, with extremely limited exceptions, DHS will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement. All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to enforcement proceedings, up to and including removal from the United States. The guidance makes clear, however, that ICE should prioritize several categories of removable aliens who have committed crimes, beginning with those convicted of a criminal offense. 
Establishing policies regarding the apprehension and detention of aliens. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will release aliens from custody only under limited circumstances, such as when removing them from the country, when an alien obtains an order granting relief by statute, when it is determined that the alien is a U.S. citizen, legal permanent resident, refugee, or asylee, or that the alien holds another protected status, when an arriving alien has been found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture and the alien satisfactorily establishes his identity and that he is not a security or flight risk, or when otherwise required to do so by statute or order by a competent judicial or administrative authority.
Hiring more CBP agents and officers. CBP will immediately begin the process of hiring 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, as well as 500 Air & Marine agents and officers, while ensuring consistency in training and standards.
Identifying and quantifying sources of aid to Mexico. The President has directed the heads of all executive departments to identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect federal aid or assistance to the government of Mexico. DHS will identify all sources of aid for each of the last five fiscal years.
Expansion of the 287(g) program in the border region. Section 287(g) of the INA authorizes written agreements with a state or political subdivision to authorize qualified officers or employees to perform the functions of an immigration officer. Empowering state and local law enforcement agencies to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law is critical to an effective enforcement strategy, and CBP and ICE will work with interested and eligible jurisdictions.
Commissioning a comprehensive study of border security. DHS will conduct a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border (air, land, and maritime) to identify vulnerabilities and provide recommendations to enhance border security. This will include all aspects of the current border security environment, including the availability of federal and state resources to develop and implement an effective border security strategy that will achieve complete operational control of the border.
Constructing and funding a border wall. DHS will immediately identify and allocate all sources of available funding for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of a wall, including the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as patrol and access roads, and develop requirements for total ownership cost of this project.
Expanding expedited removal. The DHS Secretary has the authority to apply expedited removal provisions to aliens who have not been admitted or paroled into the United States, who are inadmissible, and who have not been continuously physically present in the United States for the two-year period immediately prior to the determination of their inadmissibility, so that such aliens are immediately removed unless the alien is an unaccompanied minor, intends to apply for asylum or has a fear of persecution or torture in their home country, or claims to have lawful immigration status. To date, expedited removal has been exercised only for aliens encountered within 100 air miles of the border and 14 days of entry, and aliens who arrived in the United States by sea other than at a port of entry. The Department will publish in the Federal Register a new Notice Designating Aliens Subject to Expedited Removal Under Section 235(b)(1)(a)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that expands the category of aliens subject to expedited removal to the extent the DHS Secretary determines is appropriate, and CBP and ICE are directed to conform the use of expedited removal procedures to the designations made in this notice upon its publication.
Returning aliens to contiguous countries. When aliens apprehended do not pose a risk of a subsequent illegal entry, returning them to the foreign contiguous territory from which they arrived, pending the outcome of removal proceedings, saves DHS detention and adjudication resources for other priority aliens.  CBP and ICE personnel shall, to the extent lawful, appropriate and reasonably practicable, return such aliens to such territories pending their hearings.
Enhancing Asylum Referrals and Credible Fear Determinations. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers will conduct credible fear interviews in a manner that allows the interviewing officer to elicit all relevant information from the alien as is necessary to make a legally sufficient determination. USCIS will also increase the operational capacity of the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate.
Allocating resources and personnel to the southern border for detention of aliens and adjudication of claims. CBP and ICE will allocate available resources to expand detention capabilities and capacities at or near the border with Mexico to the greatest extent practicable. CBP will focus on short-term detention of 72 hours or less; ICE will focus on all other detention capabilities.
Properly using parole authority. Parole into the United States will be used sparingly and only in cases where, after careful consideration of the circumstances, parole is needed because of demonstrated urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. Notwithstanding other more general implementation guidance, and pending further review by the Secretary and further guidance from the Director of ICE, the ICE policy directive with respect to parole for certain arriving aliens found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture shall remain in full force and effect.
Processing and treatment of unaccompanied alien minors encountered at the border. CBP, ICE, and USCIS will establish standardized review procedures to confirm that alien children who are initially determined to be unaccompanied alien children continue to fall within the statutory definition when being considered for the legal protections afforded to such children as they go through the removal process.
Putting into place accountability measures to protect alien children from exploitation and prevent abuses of immigration laws. The smuggling or trafficking of alien children into the United States puts those children at grave risk of violence and sexual exploitation.  CBP and ICE will ensure the proper enforcement of our immigration laws against those who facilitate such smuggling or trafficking.
Prioritizing criminal prosecutions for immigration offenses committed at the border. To counter the ongoing threat to the security of the southern border, the directors of the Joint Task Forces-West, -East, and -Investigations, as well as the ICE-led Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BESTs), are directed to plan and implement enhanced counter-network operations directed at disrupting transnational criminal organizations, focused on those involved in human smuggling.
Public Reporting of Border Apprehensions Data. In order to promote transparency, CBP and ICE will develop a standardized method for public reporting of statistical data regarding aliens apprehended at or near the border for violating the immigration law.
Transparency
In order to be more transparent with the American people and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, DHS will make data on aliens apprehended at or near the southern border available to the public.

Q&A: DHS Implementation of the Executive Order on Border Security and Immigration Enforcement
Release Date: February 21, 2017
UPDATED: March 1, 2017 2:00 p.m. EST
Office of the Press Secretary
Contact: 202-282-8010
WASHINGTON – On February 20, 2017, Secretary John Kelly signed a memorandum implementing the president’s Executive Order entitled “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,” issued on January 25, 2017. This document is designed to answer some frequently asked questions about how the Department will operationally implement the guidance provided by the president’s order.
Q1. What is CBP currently doing as part of the construction of the wall?
A1. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is taking immediate action in response to the president’s executive order. The Border Patrol is conducting an operational assessment, which will identify priority areas where CBP can build a wall or similar physical barrier on the border where it currently does not exist. Locations near El Paso, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, and El Centro, California, have also been identified where we will replace areas where the fence or old brittle landing-mat fencing are no longer effective.
CBP is leveraging years of U.S. Border Patrol’s institutional operational knowledge and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ border infrastructure construction subject matter expertise to “construct a physical wall or similarly contiguous and impassable physical barrier” in the vicinity of the U.S. border with Mexico.
CBP is directly soliciting industry input for conceptual wall design(s) with the intent to construct multiple prototype(s). The primary purpose of this effort is to develop design standards for a border wall that may be constructed along the southwest border with Mexico in support of USBP operational requirements. Any and all prototypes will be designed to deter illegal entry into the United States. Wall design and construction award timelines for prototype construction will be expedited to meet immediate U.S. Border Patrol operational needs.
Q2: Why is CBP seeking to construct prototypes?
A2: Prototyping is an industry-tested approach to define the best solution when considering a new product or methodology. Through the construction of prototypes, CBP will partner with industry to identify the best means and methods to construct border wall before making a more substantial investment in construction. The prototypes will inform the final design standard which will likely continue to evolve to meet USBP’s requirements. Any and all prototypes will be designed to deter illegal entry into the United States.
The Border Patrol is in the midst of an assessment of the southern border to identify operational requirements to inform wall design decisions.
Q3. What does the operational assessment include?
A3. CBP is considering the following factors:
The current state of southern border security
All geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border
The availability of federal and state resources necessary to achieve operational control of the southern border
This analysis will inform DHS’s strategy to obtain and maintain operational control of the southern border.
The executive order directs DHS to produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border within 180 days.
Q4. Do you have the funds to construct the wall?
A4. CBP has identified funding to begin immediate construction and is working with the Administration in these efforts.
Q5: Does the Alternatives to Detention program fall under the umbrella of “catch and release” policies being abolished?
A5: No. The use of Alternatives to Detention, including the use of ankle monitors, will continue on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the officers on the ground.
Q6: What are ICE’s priorities under this executive order?
A6: Under the executive order, ICE will not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. All of those in violation of immigration law may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States.  ICE and CBP priorities are realigned consistent with those set forth in section 5 of Executive Order 13768.
Q7: Will ICE deport people for driving without a license, since it’s often an immigration-related issue?
A7: All of those in violation of immigration law may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States.
Q8: What is the new goal for ICE’s detention capacity?
A8: Although detention space may be limited at times, ICE is committed to arresting and processing all removable aliens. ICE agents and officers will make individualized custody determinations in every case, prioritizing detention resources on aliens subject to expedited removal and aliens removable on any criminal ground, national security or related ground or for fraud or material misrepresentation.
Q9: What is ICE planning in terms of obtaining additional detention centers or bed space? Have any contracts or RFPs yet been drafted? How long will it take to obtain additional bed space? How much will it cost per bed/day? Where will they be located?
A9: Following the issue of this order, ICE has already increased its detention capacity by approximately 1,100 beds.
To support the further need for increased detention capacity, particularly along the Southwest Border, ICE is currently defining contracting requirements. A list of potential detention locations is under review, which would supply additional beds.
Q10: Will ICE still be hiring the 10,000 officers called for in the executive orders?
A10: ICE is currently developing a hiring plan.
Q11: What is the 287(g) program and how will it be used by ICE?
A11: The 287(g) program allows local law enforcement agencies to participate as an active partner in identifying criminal aliens in their custody, and placing ICE detainers on these individuals. Removing criminal aliens from our communities produces a higher level of public safety for everyone. To strengthen the 287(g) program, ICE field leadership has begun examining local operational needs and liaising with potential 287(g) partners and will collaborate with CBP in these efforts. Existing 287(g) applications are also undergoing an expedited review process.
Q12: Are 287(g) officers now going to do ICE’s job?
A12: The 287(g) program, one of ICE’s top partnership initiatives, enables state and local law enforcement agencies to enter into a partnership with ICE, under a joint memorandum of agreement. The state or local entity receives delegated authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions.
Q13: When will 287(g) task force agreements be available to local jurisdictions? Will these new task force agreements be modeled after the previously canceled task force model?
A13: ICE and CBP will be  is developing a strategy to further expand the 287(g) Program, to include types of 287(g) programs, locations, and recruitment strategies.  To strengthen the 287(g) Program, ICE field leadership has begun examining local operational needs and liaising with potential 287(g) partners and will collaborate with CBP in these efforts. Existing 287(g) applications are also undergoing an expedited review process. To support the training needed for existing and new 287(g) partners, ICE is updating the 287(g) training curriculum.
Q14: How will ICE accommodate an immigration judge in each of its facilities? How about asylum officers?
A14: ICE is working with the Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to review current procedures and resources in order to identify efficiencies and best practices to improve the system. Most dedicated detention facilities already house immigration courts and have enough space to accommodate asylum officers. ICE is also seeking to increase the use of technology, mainly through the use of video teleconferencing, in locations with insufficient space or staffing.
Q15: What are you doing to reduce the reach of violent crime and transnational criminal organizations?
A15: To better target gang members responsible for violent crime and transnational criminal activities, ICE has notified field leadership to immediately assess and, if possible, realign resources to support Operation Community Shield.
Q16: Could USCIS customers be affected by the policies on the detention of aliens seeking admission pending a final determination of their inadmissibility and deportability, including eligibility for immigration relief?
A16: The policies are consistent with INA provisions that mandate the detention of certain aliens seeking admission and allow for the exercise of discretionary parole authority only on a case-by-case basis, and only for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.
Q17: The Secretary’s memorandum outlines certain situations where CBP and ICE may release an alien detained under section 235(b) of the INA, who was apprehended or encountered after illegally entering or attempting to illegally enter the United States. One of the situations is where the alien obtains an administratively final order granting relief or protection from removal or DHS determines that the individual is a U.S. citizen or an alien who is a lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee; or holds another valid immigration status such as Temporary Protected Status or a valid non-immigrant visa.
A17: The guidance is effective upon the establishment of a plan to surge immigration judges and asylum officers to process recent border entrants, and the establishment of appropriate processing and detention facilities.
Q18: How does the expansion of expedited removal account for those who may be eligible for immigration benefits?
A18: The Secretary’s intentions regarding expedited removal are under development and will be set forth and effective upon publication of a notice in the Federal Register.
Q19: How soon will DHS make changes to more closely align its use of the expedited removal authority with Congressional intent?
A19: DHS is working to issue appropriate parameters in which expedited removal in these kinds of cases will be used.
Q20: Is it true that DHS is going to make the threshold for meeting credible fear in asylum cases more difficult to meet?
A20: The goal of DHS is to ensure the asylum process is not abused. Generally speaking, to establish a credible fear of persecution, an alien must demonstrate that there is a “significant possibility” that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the claim and such other facts as are known to the officer.
Asylum officers are being directed to conduct credible fear interviews in a manner that allows the interviewing officer to elicit all relevant information from the alien as is necessary to make a legally sufficient determination. In determining whether the alien has demonstrated a significant possibility that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum or torture protection, the asylum officer shall consider the statements of the alien and determine the credibility of the alien’s statements made in support of his or her claim and shall consider other facts known to the officer, consistent with the statute.
The asylum officer shall make a positive credible fear finding only after the officer has considered all relevant evidence and determined, based on credible evidence, that the alien has a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum, or torture protection.
Q21: How will the enhancements to asylum referrals and credible fear determinations under INA section 235(b)(1) affect the work of USCIS?
A21: The Secretary’s memorandum outlines several points:
The director of USCIS shall ensure that asylum officers conduct credible fear interviews in a manner that allows the interviewing officer to elicit all relevant information from the alien as is necessary to make a legally sufficient determination.
The director shall also increase the operational capacity of Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) and continue to strengthen its integration to support the Field Operations Directorate (FOD), Refugee Asylum and International Operations (RAIO), and Service Center Operations (SCOPS), consulting with Operational Policy and Strategy (OP&S) as appropriate.
The USCIS director, CBP commissioner, and ICE director shall review their agencies’ fraud detection, deterrence, and prevention measures and report to the Secretary within 90 days regarding fraud vulnerabilities in the asylum and benefits adjudication processes, and propose measures to enhance fraud detection, deterrence, and prevention.
The asylum officer, as part of making a credible fear finding, shall determine the credibility of statements made by the individual in support of his or her claim. This determination should include, but is not limited to, consideration of the statistical likelihood that the claim would be granted by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).
The asylum officer shall make a positive credible fear finding only after the officer has considered all relevant evidence and determined, based on credible evidence, that the alien has a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum, or for withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, based on established legal authority.
Q22: How does the memorandum address the processing and treatment of unaccompanied alien minors at the border?
A22: The Secretary’s memorandum instructs the USCIS director, CBP commissioner, and ICE director to develop uniform written guidance and training for all employees and contractors of those agencies regarding the proper processing of unaccompanied alien children, the timely and fair adjudication of their claims for relief from removal, and, if appropriate, their safe repatriation at the conclusion of removal proceedings. In developing such guidance and training, they shall establish standardized review procedures to confirm that alien children who are initially determined to be “unaccompanied alien child[ren],” as defined in 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2), continue to fall within the statutory definition when being considered for the legal protections afforded to such children as they go through the removal process.
Q23: Is it true that in cases of UACs who travel to the U.S. to reunite with a parent, if a parent is identified by ORR as an appropriate guardian, that parent could also be prosecuted for possibly having their child smuggled into the U.S.?
A23: Correct. The parents and family members of these children, who are often illegally present in the United States, often pay smugglers several thousand dollars to bring their children into this country. Tragically, many of these children fall victim to robbery, extortion, kidnapping, sexual assault, and other crimes of violence by the smugglers and other criminal elements along the dangerous journey through Mexico to the United States. Regardless of the desires for family reunification, or conditions in other countries, the smuggling or trafficking of alien children is intolerable. Accordingly, DHS shall ensure the proper enforcement of our immigration laws against those who—directly or indirectly—facilitate the smuggling or trafficking of alien children into the United States. This includes placing parents or guardian who are removable aliens into removal proceedings, or referring such individuals for criminal prosecution, as appropriate.
Q24: How might the allocation of additional resources and personnel to the southern border for detention of aliens and adjudication of claims affect USCIS personnel?
A24: The screening of credible fear claims by USCIS and adjudication of asylum claims by EOIR at detention facilities located at or near the point of apprehension will facilitate an expedited resolution of those claims and result in lower detention and transportation costs. Accordingly, to the greatest extent practicable, the director of USCIS is directed to increase the number of asylum officers and FDNS officers assigned to detention facilities located at or near the border with Mexico to properly and efficiently adjudicate credible fear and reasonable fear claims and to counter asylum-related fraud.
Q25: How does the Secretary’s memorandum address the use of parole authority, as set forth in INA section 212(d)(5)?
A25: The memo notes that the statutory language appears to strongly counsel in favor of using the parole authority sparingly and only in individual cases where, after careful consideration of the circumstances, parole is needed because of demonstrated urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. It states the practice of granting parole to certain aliens in pre-designated categories in order to create immigration programs not established by Congress has contributed to a border security crisis, undermined the integrity of the immigration laws and the parole process, and created an incentive for additional illegal immigration.
Therefore, the USCIS director, CBP commissioner, and ICE director are directed to ensure that appropriate written policy guidance and training is provided to employees exercising parole authority, including advance parole. These employees should be familiar with the proper exercise of parole under section 212(d)(5) of the INA and exercise such parole authority only on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the law and written policy guidance.  Notwithstanding other implementation guidance, and pending further review by the Secretary and additional guidance from the Director of ICE, the ICE policy directive establishing standards and procedures for the parole of certain arriving aliens found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture shall remain in full force and effect.
Q26: The implementation guidance references rescinding all previous immigration enforcement memos. Does this include the ICE and CBP memorandum on sensitive locations?
A26: No, the sensitive locations guidance remains in effect for both ICE and CBP.
Q27: Is DHS going to being immediately sending Mexican nationals and individuals of other nationalities who traveled through Mexico to the U.S. back to Mexico while they await the outcome of their removal proceedings?
A27: DHS will continue to work with the Mexican government and the Department of State to determine how to best implement this guidance. However, consistent with the law and U.S. international treaty obligations, CBP and ICE personnel shall, to the extent appropriate and reasonably practicable, return aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA, who are placed in removal proceedings under section 240 of the INA—and who, consistent with the guidance of an ICE Field Office Director, CBP Chief Patrol Agent, or CBP Director of Field Operations, pose no risk of recidivism—to the territory of the foreign contiguous country from which they arrived pending such removal proceedings. We will work with the countries involved to ensure proper coordination on the safe and humane return of their nationals.
Q28: Do these memoranda affect recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?
A28: No.

On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order, “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,” which includes costly plans to further militarize the U.S.-Mexico border, curtail due process, and expand problematic detention and enforcement practices. The order will likely result in asylum seekers, families, children, and others being turned away and denied access to humanitarian protection guaranteed for decades under U.S. and international law. 
The order demands the construction of a contiguous wall along the nearly 2,000-mile southern border; provides additional resources to Border Patrol agents; drastically increases detention along and beyond the southern border; expands the use of expedited removal to the entire nation while limiting the use of discretion in deciding whom to deport; and outlines enforcement changes, including authorizing more state and local officials to enforce federal immigration laws. 
Overall, the provisions in the order pose serious concerns for the protection and due process rights of those currently residing in the United States, communities along the U.S-Mexico border, and vulnerable populations seeking protection in the country. Additionally, the order would require tremendous additional funding that would increase the country's record-level spending on existing border security and interior enforcement measures.
Construct an ""Impassable"" Southern Border
The executive order directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take immediate steps to allocate available funds to build a contiguous, physical wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and to create a long-term funding plan for the wall. It also calls for more resources to be allocated to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), including the hiring of 5,000 additional agents.
Adding to the existing border fencing is superfluous and wasteful. As of early 2017, approximately 650 miles of border fence are already in place, including:
350 miles of primary pedestrian fencing;
300 miles of vehicle fencing;
36 miles of secondary fencing behind the primary fencing; and
14 miles of tertiary pedestrian fencing behind the secondary fence.
The estimated average cost of the remaining segments of the border wall ranges from $15 to $25 billion, with each mile of fencing costing $16 million. The head of the National Border Patrol Council, a union representing 16,000 Border Patrol agents which endorsed President Trump during his campaign, said, “We do not need a wall along the entire 2,000 miles of border.”
In order to build the wall, Congress will have to appropriate significant additional funding. It is unclear if Congress is willing to spend many billions of dollars or incur the additional yearly costs for fence maintenance and upkeep.
Increase the Use of Detention at the Border and in the Interior
The order, if funded, will massively expand the use of detention. Individuals merely suspected of violating immigration law can now be apprehended and detained, pending further proceedings, according to the administration's policy announced in the order.
In addition, the order directs DHS to detain all individuals in removal proceedings to the maximum extent of the law, regardless of whether they are merely awaiting their court hearing or have a final order of deportation. It also directs the termination of “catch and release.” This term refers to the practice of releasing non-Mexican migrants from detention while they await their removal hearings, which, contrary to the language in the order, DHS ended in 2006. 
This dramatic shift in the use of detention would impose tremendous due process and humanitarian costs on immigrant families and communities, not only at the border, but throughout the country. Detained immigrants are the least likely to have counsel to help them navigate the immigration court system; from 2007-2012, only 14 percent of detainees acquired legal counsel, compared to two-thirds of non-detained immigrants.
Expand Detention Capacity
The order further directs DHS to immediately construct detention facilities along the southern border, where asylum officers and immigration judges will be assigned to conduct interviews and removal proceedings. The expanded use of mandatory detention as described in the order is not feasible with the current number of detention beds. Congress has directed ICE to maintain 34,000 detention beds and appropriated funds to pay for them. Yet, as of the fall of 2016, ICE was far over capacity, with more than 40,000 people in immigration detention.
Construction and maintenance costs for new detention facilities would be exorbitant; spending on ICE’s 34,000 detention beds costs taxpayers over $2 billion each year. Since the federal government is operating under a Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 continuing resolution until April 28, 2017, it is doubtful that sufficient funds currently exist to implement these plans.
Moreover, additional funds would likely be needed in order to assign asylum officers and immigration judges to more detention facilities. Yet, there is already a shortage of officers and judges in the country. The Executive Office for Immigration Review has been unable to hire the number of immigration judges that Congress appropriated funding for in FY 2017. It is unclear whether asylum officers or immigration judges would be deemed exempt from a January 23, 2017, executive memorandum authorizing a government-wide hiring freeze.
Expand Expedited Removal
The order directs DHS to dramatically expand the use of “expedited removal,” a process that permits immigration officers to quickly deport certain noncitizens without seeing an immigration judge often in as little as 24 hours.
The order could permit immigration officers to apply expedited removal throughout the country to all individuals who unlawfully entered the United States and cannot prove to DHS that they have been continuously present for the previous two years. Prior policies limited the use of expedited removal to border regions (broadly defined as within 100 miles of any U.S. border) and to individuals who were apprehended within 14 days of entry to the United States.
Once implemented, the order will eviscerate due process for large numbers of undocumented individuals in the United States, even those with family ties and deep roots in our communities, like Dreamers. The United States Commission on International and Religious Freedom—an independent, bipartisan federal commission—extensively documented how expedited removal sends many asylum seekers back into danger without a meaningful chance to present their claim to a judge.
Local Law Enforcement Acting as Immigration Officials under the 287(g) Program
The order also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to increase the number of 287(g) agreements¾a program where DHS deputizes select state and local law enforcement officers to perform the functions of federal immigration agents under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Deputized officers are authorized to interview individuals to determine their immigration status; check DHS databases for information on individuals; issue ICE ""detainers"" to hold them until ICE takes custody; and issue a Notice to Appear (NTA), the official charging document that begins the immigration court removal process.
Problems with the 287(g) program are well-documented. A March 2010 report by the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) found, among other things, that ICE and its local law enforcement partners had not complied with the terms of their 287(g) agreements; that the evaluation parameters for deputized officers contradicted the stated objectives of the program; and that the program was poorly supervised by ICE and needed additional oversight. Under the Obama administration, the program was significantly reduced and ended agreements that had allowed deputized officers to interrogate and arrest alleged noncitizens encountered in the field who they believe violated federal immigration laws. In other words, agreements could only deputize officials to act as immigration officials in jails rather than in the field.
The executive order directs DHS to establish more agreements that are structured to maximize the enforcement of federal immigration laws, but it is unclear what other changes may be involved. The 287(g) expansion will require additional funds from Congress to pay for local law enforcement training and ICE supervision of the program.
Conduct Removal Proceedings Outside of the U.S.
The order instructs DHS to ensure that applicants for admission arriving on land from Mexico and Canada are returned to the country from which they approached the United States, pending a formal removal proceeding. In order to do this, there will presumably need to be cooperation from Mexico and Canada. It is unclear how exactly this would be implemented, but the possibility raises significant due process concerns.
Limit Humanitarian Protection
The order targets two important statutory mechanisms for protecting vulnerable immigrants: (1) “parole” (by which DHS can allow an individual to enter or stay in the country, or be released from detention for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit), and (2) “credible fear” screenings for asylum seekers.
The order requires DHS to ensure that these protections are not “exploited” to allow individuals who are otherwise removable to remain in the United States. DHS’ statutory parole authority is broad, and has been used in the past on a case-by-case basis to keep families together, especially military families. A policy change in this area could have devastating implications for close family members of U.S. soldiers. In addition, heightening the credible fear standard would make it even harder for asylum seekers with genuine claims under U.S. law to ever have the opportunity to present those claims to a judge.
Prioritize Criminal Prosecution of Unlawful Entry
The order directs the Attorney General to prioritize the prosecution of any offense connected to the southern border—including nonviolent offenses like unlawful entry. This would further militarize border communities and take limited U.S. attorney resources away from prosecuting other types of crimes—including violent crimes—thereby reducing public safety. In FY 2016, these immigration-related prosecutions already represented 52 percent of the total federal court docket.

SPEECH
Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks Announcing the Department of Justice’s Renewed Commitment to Criminal Immigration Enforcement

Remarks as prepared for delivery
Good morning, everyone. Let me start by thanking the brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection, who not only served as our gracious hosts today, but who put themselves in harm’s way each day to secure our borders and protect us.
Here, along our nation’s southwest border, is ground zero in this fight. Here, under the Arizona sun, ranchers work the land to make an honest living, and law-abiding citizens seek to provide for their families.
But it is also here, along this border, that transnational gangs like MS-13 and international cartels flood our country with drugs and leave death and violence in their wake. And it is here that criminal aliens and the coyotes and the document-forgers seek to overthrow our system of lawful immigration.
Let’s stop here for a minute. When we talk about MS-13 and the cartels, what do we mean? We mean criminal organizations that turn cities and suburbs into warzones, that rape and kill innocent citizens and who profit by smuggling poison and other human beings across our borders. Depravity and violence are their calling cards, including brutal machete attacks and beheadings.
It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.
In this fight, I am here to tell you, the brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection: we hear you and we have your back. Under the President’s leadership and through his Executive Orders, we will secure this border and bring the full weight of both the immigration courts and federal criminal enforcement to combat this attack on our national security and sovereignty.
The President has made this a priority — and already we are seeing the results. From January to February of this year, illegal crossings dropped by 40 percent, which was unprecedented. Then, last month, we saw a 72 percent drop compared to the month before the President was inaugurated. That’s the lowest monthly figure for at least 17 years.
This is no accident. This is what happens when you have a President who understands the threat, who is not afraid to publically identify the threat and stand up to it, and who makes clear to law enforcement that the leadership of their country finally has their back. Together, we will drastically reduce the danger posed by criminal aliens, gang members and cartel henchmen.
To that end, the President and I want to do our best to arm you, and the prosecutors who partner with you, with more tools in your fight against criminal aliens. So today, I am pleased to stand here with you and announce new guidance regarding our commitment to criminal immigration enforcement. As we speak, I am issuing a document to all federal prosecutors that mandates the prioritization of such enforcement.
Starting today, federal prosecutors are now required to consider for prosecution all of the following offenses:
The transportation or harboring of aliens. As you know too well, this is a booming business down here. No more. We are going to shut down and jail those who have been profiting off this lawlessness — people smuggling gang members across the border, helping convicted criminals re-enter this country and preying on those who don’t know how dangerous the journey can be.
Further, where an alien has unlawfully entered the country, which is a misdemeanor, that alien will now be charged with a felony if they unlawfully enter or attempt enter a second time and certain aggravating circumstances are present.
Also, aliens that illegally re-enter the country after prior removal will be referred for felony prosecution — and a priority will be given to such offenses, especially where indicators of gang affiliation, a risk to public safety or criminal history are present.
Fourth: where possible, prosecutors are directed to charge criminal aliens with document fraud and aggravated identity theft — the latter carrying a two-year mandatory minimum sentence.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly: I have directed that all 94 U.S. Attorneys Offices make the prosecution of assault on a federal law enforcement officer — that’s all of you — a top priority. If someone dares to assault one of our folks in the line of duty, they will do federal time for it.
To ensure that these priorities are implemented, starting today, each U.S. Attorney’s Office, whether on the border or interior, will designate an Assistant United States Attorney as the Border Security Coordinator for their District. It will be this experienced prosecutor’s job to coordinate the criminal immigration enforcement response for their respective offices.
For those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era. This is the Trump era. The lawlessness, the abdication of the duty to enforce our immigration laws and the catch and release practices of old are over.
In that vein, I am also pleased to announce a series of reforms regarding immigration judges to reduce the significant backlogs in our immigration courts.
Pursuant to the President’s executive order, we will now be detaining all adults who are apprehended at the border. To support this mission, we have already surged 25 immigration judges to detention centers along the border. I want to thank personally the judges who answered the call to help us with this new initiative.
In addition, we will put 50 more immigration judges on the bench this year and 75 next year. We can no longer afford to wait 18 to 24 months to get these new judges on the bench. So today, I have implemented a new, streamlined hiring plan. It requires just as much vetting as before, but reduces the timeline, reflecting the dire need to reduce the backlogs in our immigration courts.
With the President’s Executive Orders on Border Security, Transnational Criminal Organizations and Public Safety as our guideposts, we will execute a strategy that once again secures the border; apprehends and prosecutes those criminal aliens that threaten our public safety; takes the fight to gangs like MS-13 and Los Zetas; and makes dismantlement and destruction of the cartels a top priority. We will deploy a multifaceted approach in these efforts: we are going to interdict your drugs on the way in, your money on the way out, and investigate and prosecute your trafficking networks to the fullest extent of the law.
Why are we doing this? Because it is what the duly enacted laws of the United States require. I took an oath to protect this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic. How else can we look the parents and loved ones of Kate Steinle, Grant Ronnebeck and so many others in eye and say we are doing everything possible to prevent such tragedies from ever occurring again?
Let me finish where I started, by thanking you — the brave men and women in uniform who are at the front lines of this fight. I know we ask a tremendous amount from all of you, but know this: we have your back, and will do all we can to empower you and support you in your work.
God bless you and thank you.

Trump Executive Orders Pull States and Cities into Immigration Enforcement

L
ost in the press coverage of the executive orders on immigration signed by President Trump in his first week in office is the extent to which, on several fronts, the president is intending to pull states and localities into immigration enforcement, both at the border and in the nation’s interior. The conflict between states and the federal government on immigration policy has been on display in several areas over the last decade, and has been seen most recently in federal court cases brought by states against first President Obama and then President Trump over their executive actions on immigration. Congress has failed to pass legislative immigration reform, leaving states and localities to act, but the Trump orders would, by agreement or by coercion, put states and localities squarely in the middle of immigration enforcement in the United States. This week, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly signed two memoranda to the heads of the department’s immigration agencies implementing these executive orders, confirming that the department will immediately seek to engage states and localities for this purpose.
The first order signed by the president on January 25, 2017, “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,” was significant for its instruction to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to “immediately” take steps to begin construction of the border wall. But the order also included several provisions that would authorize and empower state and local law enforcement agencies to help with securing the border as well as immigration enforcement in the interior.
Trump intends to make state and local law enforcement his deportation force. 
Section 4(d) of the order mandates that DHS conduct a “comprehensive study of the security of the southern border,” including “the availability of Federal and State resources” necessary to achieve “complete operational control.” While the role of state and local law enforcement in working with federal officials to identify and apprehend unauthorized immigrants in the United States has been the subject of debate, it is usually unquestioned that the federal government has the responsibility for securing the international borders of the United States. Some states, notably Texas, have tasked state law enforcement with certain border activities, usually supporting Border Patrol. However, under this provision, confirmed in the Kelly memos, the administration intends to seek state assistance in providing resources to assist with securing the U.S.-Mexico border.
This inference is reinforced later in Section 12(a) of the order which authorizes the DHS Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior to “permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have access to all Federal lands,” to implement the order. Paragraph (b) of that section further authorizes the secretary to “enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to perform such actions on Federal land as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to implement this order.” The House Committee on Natural Resources reports that approximately 20 million acres of federal land abut the U.S.-Mexico border, mostly in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and California. There has been an ongoing battle between the Border Patrol and the Interior Department over access to these lands for decades, but the inclusion of state and local “officers” in the mandate to allow access to and enabling activities in these areas is unprecedented.

Guest post: border security and interior enforcement
Guest blogger Anne Bonfiglio, a second-year student at Temple Law, shares her reflections on last week’s Sheller-Center-sponsored panel (the first in our “Making Sense of the Legal Headlines” series).
Midway through the Q&A of last week’s panel on Border Security and Interior Enforcement, a student prefaced a question with the comment, “this is really depressing.”  Exiting the event, a professor confessed that only seconds before that remark a colleague had whispered the same to her.  For those who care about the rights of immigrants, January’s executive orders certainly are disheartening.  For those in the country without status, they are terrifying.  But I left with a more hopeful takeaway: these orders are vulnerable in the face of resistance.
The lecture, given by Professors Ramji-Nogales and Spiro, focused on the two Executive Orders signed January 25, 2017.  The first, “Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,” orders the construction of the infamous border wall.  The second, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” attacks “sanctuary jurisdictions” by removing their eligibility for Federal grants.  Additionally, these orders authorize an expansion of detention facilities, expedited removal, and immigration officer hiring, expand the definition of a criminal alien, and require the publication of data supporting the President’s anti-immigrant position.
On their face, these provisions are alarming.  Unfortunately, some, such as the expansion of expedited removal, are well within the President’s statutory authority (though they may present constitutional questions).  But others are less secure.  Some provisions, including increased hiring, detention, and the wall, are subject to Congressional budgetary approval.  Others, like the various reporting obligations, have inadequate infrastructure.  And the crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions has at least three possible legal arguments against it: precedents prohibiting the commandeering of local law enforcement, constraining the use of funding to force compliance, and basic Fourth Amendment Protections.
While these orders have yet to be challenged in court, they can be resisted, whether through lawsuits or local community support of undocumented residents.  As an immigrants’ rights advocate, I find inspiration in these possibilities.  Yes, recent policy is depressing and the toll on families is staggering.  But it is important that one doesn’t become overwhelmed by these costs. Immigrant advocates are mobilizing; as social justice lawyers and students, it is our job to promote an understanding of the legal arguments available in this fight.
Anne has put together two sets of links for further reading — one comprising legal sources, news and commentary, the other a collection of “know your rights” and other materials for community education and organizing.

EXECUTIVE ORDERS
Executive Order: Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements
IMMIGRATION
Issued on: January 25, 2017
ALL NEWS
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation’s immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.
Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.
Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation’s southern border. Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws – and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders – the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation’s southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:
(a) secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;
(b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;
(c) expedite determinations of apprehended individuals’ claims of eligibility to remain in the United States;
(d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed;
(e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.
Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) “Asylum officer” has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).
(b) “Southern border” shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.
(c) “Border States” shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.
(d) Except as otherwise noted, “the Secretary” shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.
(e) “Wall” shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.
(f) “Executive department” shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code.
(g) “Regulations” shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.
(h) “Operational control” shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.
Sec. 4. Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States. The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:
(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;
(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;
(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and
(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.
Sec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.
(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.
(c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.
Sec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as “catch and release,” whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.
Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.
Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.
Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.
Sec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.
(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).
(b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.
(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.
Sec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal. It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.
(a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.
(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.
(c) Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).
(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.
(e) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law.
Sec. 12. Authorization to Enter Federal Lands. The Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior and any other heads of agencies as necessary, shall take all appropriate action to:
(a) permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have access to all Federal lands as necessary and appropriate to implement this order; and
(b) enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to perform such actions on Federal lands as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to implement this order.
Sec. 13. Priority Enforcement. The Attorney General shall take all appropriate steps to establish prosecution guidelines and allocate appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high priority to prosecutions of offenses having a nexus to the southern border.
Sec. 14. Government Transparency. The Secretary shall, on a monthly basis and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on aliens apprehended at or near the southern border using a uniform method of reporting by all Department of Homeland Security components, in a format that is easily understandable by the public.
Sec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney General, within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order.
Sec. 16. Hiring. The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.
Sec. 17. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Border Security
Blue Lightning
The Blue Lightning Initiative (BLI), led by the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Department of Transportation, is an element of the DHS Blue Campaign. The BLI trains airline personnel to identify potential traffickers and human trafficking victims, and to report their suspicions to federal law enforcement.  To date, more than 70,000 personnel in the aviation industry have been trained through the BLI, and actionable tips continue to be reported to law enforcement. 
Blue Lightning Initiative Training Module
The “FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016,” signed by the President on July 15, 2016, requires air carriers to provide initial and annual flight attendant training regarding recognizing and responding to potential human trafficking victims.  Becoming a BLI partner and using the virtual training is a simple and responsible way to adhere to the new requirement.
We recently updated the BLI training based on feedback from airlines and human trafficking survivors. 
The new BLI training, which can be previewed through the 3-minute trailer below, is 17 minutes in length, and is comprised of four lessons that include:
What is Human Trafficking?
Indicators of Human Trafficking Activity
Reporting Suspected Human Trafficking
Indicator Challenge
How Does the Blue Lightning Initiative Work?
Participating airlines instruct their employees using the BLI virtual training module and associated printed educational materials. The training may be integrated into airlines' initial or refresher training for flight attendants, pilots, customer service representatives, and other personnel.
The BLI training illustrates common indicators of trafficking that airline employees may encounter, and how to immediately report suspected trafficking to law enforcement.
The BLI’s real-time reporting mechanism gives law enforcement the ability to research and analyze information, and to coordinate an appropriate and effective response.
To alert authorities about suspected trafficking, as outlined in the BLI training, airline employees can follow their airline's in-flight reporting protocol or call the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations Tip Line.
How can airlines participate?
For airlines wanting to learn more about using the BLI to inform their employees about human trafficking and their reporting options, contact bluecampaign@hq.dhs.gov and trafficking@dot.gov for more information.
Participation is open to any U.S. airline. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation are considering whether and how to expand the BLI training to foreign-flagged airlines.
What other actions can airlines take to help stop human trafficking?
Airlines can post Blue Campaign posters, indicator cards or basic human trafficking awareness materials inside aircrafts as well as airing the Blue Campaign infographic on pre-flight videos to educate passengers to recognize and report human trafficking.
What can passengers do?
We all have a responsibility to be vigilant. Passengers can help by learning the basic indicators of human trafficking by taking DHS Blue Campaign's general awareness training to recognize and report human trafficking.

Securing America's Borders Fact Sheet: Border Security
The Smart Border of the Future
America requires a border management system that keeps pace with expanding trade while protecting the United States and its territories from the threats of terrorist attack, illegal immigration, illegal drugs, and other contraband. The border of the future must integrate actions abroad to screen goods and people prior to their arrival in sovereign U.S. territory, and inspections at the border and measures within the United States to ensure compliance with entry and import permits. Federal border control agencies must have seamless information-sharing systems that allow for coordinated communication among themselves, and also the broader law enforcement and intelligence gathering communities. This integrated system would provide timely enforcement of laws and regulations. Agreements with our neighbors, major trading partners, and private industry will allow extensive pre-screening of low-risk traffic, thereby allowing limited assets to focus attention on high-risk traffic. The use of advanced technology to track the movement of cargo and the entry and exit of individuals is essential to the task of managing the movement of hundreds of millions of individuals, conveyances, and vehicles.
Some of this work has already begun with Canada, our largest trading partner. On December 12, 2001, Governor Tom Ridge, Director of the Office of Homeland Security, and John Manley, then Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed the ""Smart Border Declaration"" with a 30-point action plan that will help speed and secure the flow of people and goods between the United States and Canada. The Smart Border Declaration recognizes that ""our current and future prosperity and security depend on a border that operates efficiently and effectively under all circumstances."" A similar effort is currently underway with Mexico.
Border Security Initiatives in the 2003 Budget
In the 2003 Budget, the President will propose approximately $11 billion for border security, including $380 million for the Immigration and Naturalization Service to construct a state of the art Entry-Exit visa system. In total, this will represent an increase of $2.2 billion from the 2002 Budget for border security. This additional funding will allow our border agencies to begin implementing a seamless air, land, and sea border that protects the United States against foreign threats while moving legitimate goods and people into and out of the country. The new border initiatives will be managed by the agencies with primary responsibility for border control.
U.S. Customs Service -- Inspections
The President's 2003 Budget increases the inspection budget of the Customs Services by $619 million, for a total of $2.3 billion.  This additional funding increases the ability of the Customs Service to fulfill its critical border security role. Specifically, the additional resources in the 2003 Budget will allow the Customs Service to achieve the following key objectives:
Additional Personnel.  The Customs Service will complete the hiring of approximately 800 new inspectors and agents to carry out additional security activities on our borders and at our seaports.
New Technology.  The President's Budget provides resources to purchase technologically advanced equipment that will assist in inspecting shipments so that time consuming and labor-intensive searches can be minimized.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) -- Enforcement
The President's 2003 Budget increases the INS budget for enforcement by $1.2 billion, for a total of $5.3 billion, including the resources necessary to implement the Entry-Exit visa system. These resources will enhance key INS missions related to homeland security, including border patrol, inspections, and the implementation of a technologically advanced system for monitoring the entry and exit of foreign visitors. Key goals include:
Additional Personnel.   The INS will more than double the number of border patrol agents and inspectors on the northern border. INS will also install integrated information systems to ensure that timely, accurate and complete enforcement data is transmitted to INS agents and other border security agencies operating in the field.
Entry-Exit Tracking System.   The INS will implement a new entry-exit system to track the arrival and departure of non-U.S. citizens. This new system will dramatically improve our ability to deny access to those individuals who should not enter the United States, while speeding the entry of routine, legitimate traffic.
United States Coast Guard
The President's 2003 Budget increases funding for the Coast Guard's homeland security-related missions (protecting ports and coastal areas, as well as interdiction activities) by $282 million, to an overall level of $2.9 billion. After September 11, the Coast Guard's port security mission grew from approximately 1-2 percent of daily operations to between 50-60 percent today. In addition, the Coast Guard has important national security missions such as illegal immigration and drug interdiction and port security.
Coordination.   Working with other port entities, the Coast Guard is developing tracking mechanisms for all vessels operating in the maritime domain: within or transiting to U.S. ports and transiting our coastal waters. The heart of this maritime domain awareness program is accurate information, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance of all vessels, cargo, and people extending well beyond our traditional maritime boundaries.
Coastal Asset and Infrastructure Protection.  Coast Guard forces will provide enhanced defenses for critical high-risk vessels and coastal facilities, marine and otherwise (e.g. nuclear power plants, oil refineries). Close coordination through Harbor Safety Committees, which help bring together the many local, state, and Federal agencies that maintain and protect the harbor, will ensure a well-balanced protective envelope is sustained at different threat levels

Home Canine Adoption Program
Canine Adoption Program
Thank you for your interest in the TSA Canine Training Center Adoption Program. Dogs available for adoption are ones that do not meet the TSA Canine Training Center criteria for government work. These dogs are highly active and in most cases, untrained and not house broken, but with proper training and care, they can be a great addition to families. On occasion, there are dogs that have been retired from government service.
Applications are processed on a first come first served basis. Every effort is made to pair applicants who meet all requirements with dogs that suit their home, family and lifestyle.
If you are a law enforcement or a non-profit service agency interested in obtaining a dog from the program please send an email for additional information.
Home Requirements
You must have a fenced in yard at the time of applying.
There should be no intentions of moving within six months of adopting a dog.
Homes must abide by all local pet ordinances.
You must agree to provide the dog with appropriate medical care, exercise, training and companionship.
All existing pets in the home must have current vaccinations and preventive care.
The age of children in the home will be taken into consideration when selecting a dog.
Location
Approved applicants must travel to Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, San Antonio, Texas where the dogs are located. The dog cannot be shipped to you and you may need to make multiple visits. There are no same day adoptions.
Application Process
Applying: TSA will only consider applicants who meet the minimum requirements listed above. If you are interested in adopting one of the dogs, please email the adoptions coordinator at adoptatsacanine@tsa.dhs.gov. We will email you with further information.

King Participates in Classified Briefing on Northern Border Security
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) participated in a classified briefing held before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security to discuss the security situation along the Northern Border. Senator King, who is not a member of the Subcommittee, was invited to attend the briefing along with senators from other Northern Border states.
Senator King and his colleagues were briefed by high-ranking officials from the U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement on threat reporting, smuggling and trafficking trends, border security technology requirements, and staffing in remote locations. The briefing follows the Senate’s recent approval of bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Senator King – the Northern Border Security Review Act – which requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a comprehensive examination of the current resources and personnel levels and fully evaluate security threats and challenges at the border.
“The Northern Border with Canada is not only the longest border in the United States, but it’s the longest border between any two countries in the world – which means that it requires robust resources and personnel to secure it from those wishing to enter the our country illegally, smuggle drugs here, or conduct other unlawful activities,” Senator King said. “Many remote areas in Maine are on the front lines when it comes to border security, and today’s briefing, along with my continued conversation with border patrol officials in Maine, are part of an ongoing discussion about how we can support the agencies and people working on the ground to bolster our border security and protect Maine people.”
Today’s classified briefing featured witnesses from several government agencies working on border protection, including Mark Morgan, the Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol; Derek Banner, Deputy Executive Associate Director of the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement; and Raymond Villanueva, International Operations Assistant Director of the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
  At 5,500 miles long – including 1,500 miles between Alaska and Canada – the Northern Border has 120 border crossings, many of which are small and in rural areas. Approximately 300,000 people and $910 million in trade cross the Northern Border every day, representing the largest bilateral flow of goods and people in the world.
The Senate recently passed the Northern Border Security Review Act, which would require a comprehensive examination of the following issues:
Recruiting and retaining border security officials to cover the Northern Border, including at more remote areas of the border;
Determining tools border security officials need to effectively combat drug and human trafficking at the Northern Border;
Identifying technology that could expand the reach of border agents; and
Finding vulnerabilities in cooperation between Canadian, state, county, local, and tribal law enforcement.

All REAL ID extensions are pending a decision by Secretary Kelly until further notice.  For states with extensions that expire after June 6, 2017 that do not receive an extension, Federal agencies will not begin enforcement until the grace period ends on July 10, 2017.   During the grace period, Federal facilities are expected to continue accepting drivers licenses and identification cards issued by states with an expired limited extension. 
Secretary Kelly is considering extensions within the broader context of the current threat environment and the need to have secure forms of identification for accessing Federal facilities and boarding commercial aircraft.  He believes the time has come for full implementation and is firmly committed to enforcing the law.
DHS will provide more information on this website when it becomes available.
We look forward to continuing to work with your jurisdiction in meeting the minimum security standards for driver’s licenses and identification cards. Please contact us if you have any questions at OSIIS@DHS.GOV(link sends email).

International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) Program Overview
International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) bring together international law enforcement agencies to reduce crime, combat terrorism, and share in knowledge and training. The academies were established by President Clinton, and are administered by the United States Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. 
The mission of the ILEAs is to support emerging democracies, help protect U.S. interests through international cooperation and to promote social, political and economic stability by combating criminal activity.  To reach these goals, the ILEAS conduct activities designed to realize the following objectives:
Support regional and local criminal justice institution building and law enforcement
Facilitate strengthened partnerships among countries in regions served by the ILEAS aimed at addressing problems of narcotics and crime
Provide exceptional training and technical assistance in formulating strategies and tactics for foreign law enforcement personnel
Improve coordination, foster cooperation, and, as appropriate, facilitate harmonization of law enforcement activities within regions, in a manner compatible with U.S. interests. 
There are currently four ILEA Academies: Europe (Budapest), Africa (Gaborone), Central and South America (San Salvador) and Asia (Bangkok). A Regional Training Center has also been established in Lima, Peru, and an Academic ILEA in Roswell, New Mexico, offers academic aspects of law enforcement at the “Advanced Management “level.
The regional ILEAs offer three different fields of programs. The CORE program, specialized training courses, and regional seminars. The CORE program typically includes 50 participants and is focused on improving the investigative and management skills of selected police officials. The specialized courses, comprised of about 30 participants, are normally one or two weeks long and often run simultaneously with the Core course. These courses provide in-depth instruction on areas of concern or of urgent need. Topics of the Regional Seminars include transnational crimes, counter-terrorism and financial crimes.
The goal of the Law Enforcement Leadership Development (LELD) six-week core course is to strengthen international security, enhance cooperation between foreign law enforcement authorities and U.S. law enforcement agencies engaged in combating organized crime and other criminal investigations.

DHS/CBP/PIA-010 Analytical Framework for Intelligence (AFI)
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Analytical Framework for Intelligence (AFI) system provides enhanced search and analytical capabilities to identify, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who pose a potential law enforcement or security risk, and aids in the enforcement of customs, immigration, and other laws enforced by DHS at the border. Since the original Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), CBP has increased technical safeguards in AFI; added a new user role, additional DHS users, and additional data sources; and developed a governance process that includes the operational and oversight components of CBP. CBP is updating the original AFI PIA to address Privacy Compliance Review (PCR) recommendations and to promote transparency regarding the new users, data sources, data access, and analytic functions of AFI.

San Clemente, California 92674
(760) 430-7029
The San Clemente Border Patrol Station maintains a full-time traffic checkpoint on the northbound lanes of Interstate 5. It is one of seven stations in the San Diego Border Patrol Sector and operations one of four checkpoints. Checkpoint activities are directed against the smuggling of illegal aliens and narcotics away from the border area.
The strategy of the San Clemente checkpoint evolved from line-watch activities and is tied directly to border enforcement activities. The strategic importance of San Clemente lies in its placement at a major route of egress from the immediate border, thus enabling the Border Patrol to provide a depth of defense beyond the international boundary and to effect broader border security throughout the border area.
Vehicular traffic is inspected at the checkpoint by officers manning positions on the freeway. Due to heavy traffic volume, contact with motorists is minimal with prolonged questioning and vehicle inspections taking place in the Secondary Inspection site.
The San Clemente Station participates in a variety of community activities.
For more information about the San Diego Border Patrol Sector, please check our General Information section.

Border controls
By means of border control, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (RNLM) combats cross-border crime and makes an important contribution to national security. For instance, by combating terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, identity fraud and people smuggling.

Borders of Schengen countries
The Schengen countries made agreements concerning visa policy, asylum policy and cooperation between the police and the judiciary in the Schengen Agreement. Although the Schengen Agreement is part of European Union regulations, non-EU countries may also join the agreement.
One of the agreements recorded in the treaty is that there shall be no border control between the European countries in the Schengen area. There is one single EU external border. This means, for instance, that there are no longer any border checks at the Dutch borders with Belgium and Germany. 
Travellers should, however, be able to show their valid travel document within the Schengen area; this is to combat illegal immigration and all forms of criminal activity. The RNLM performs these checks for the Ministry of Justice and Security.

Mobile Security Monitoring
Mobile Security Monitoring (Mobiel Toezicht Veiligheid/MTV) is the monitoring of people travelling from another Schengen country to the Netherlands via the Belgian or German border. The checks are conducted on roads, in trains, on the water and at airports.  In the area immediately behind the border, the RNLM performs random checks on travel documents. 
For mobile checks, the RNLM uses the @migoboras camera system as a tool. The checks are performed to combat illegal immigration and cross-border crime.
Control at the external borders of the Schengen area
Checks are still performed at the external borders of the Schengen area. In the Netherlands, this means guarding the European external border at airports and seaports, and along the coast. By participating in Frontex, the European border control agency, the RNLM makes an important contribution to the control of Europe’s external borders in other EU member states.

Show options
Migration control dogs
Migration control dogs help the RNLM in finding concealed persons (stowaways), for instance in trucks, touring cars and buses crossing the borders. They also search ships for stowaways. In the Dutch ports of IJmuiden and Hoek van Holland, the dogs search ships and cargo (including heavy goods vehicles) travelling to and from the United Kingdom by ferry.
Enforcement of the Aliens Act
The RNLM also deals with asylum seekers who immediately apply for asylum at the border. The RNLM is responsible for the first reception. They also hand over aliens who are under a deportation order to foreign authorities, and receive Dutch nationals who are unwanted abroad from foreign authorities. Personnel of the RNLM receive special training to carry out these specific tasks humanely and with respect for all those involved.
The RNLM can request any traveller with a non-European nationality for documentation showing they have sufficient income upon their entry into the Netherlands, as each individual should be able to provide for themselves. What if a traveller does not meet the requirements to travel into the Schengen area? In that case, the RNLM will deny them entry into the country.

CBP Creates Trade Enforcement Task Force
Release Date Mon, 05/02/2016
WASHINGTON — U.S. Customs and Border Protection established a Trade Enforcement Task Force last month within CBP’s Office of Trade to further protect the American economy and domestic industry. The task force is focused on issues related to enforcement of antidumping and countervailing duty laws, and interdiction of imported products using forced labor. Both antidumping and countervailing duty are tariffs imposed on foreign imports priced below fair market value to ensure a level playing field for domestic producers.
“This task force strengthens CBP's ability to detect high-risk activity, target illicit trade networks, and work with industry to disrupt evasion of U.S. trade laws,” said CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske. “It focuses expertise and resources to safeguard the U.S. market and ensure a fair and competitive trade environment.""
The task force enables CBP to leverage new enforcement authorities of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, which strengthens CBP’s enforcement capabilities and methods to better enforce U.S. trade laws, including antidumping countervailing duty laws. The Act also enhance CBP’s efforts to combat the import of counterfeit goods and protect intellectual property rights holders, and eliminates obstacles to preventing imports made with forced or child labor into the United States.
The CBP task force will harness the agency’s collective trade enforcement expertise as a focal point for coordination with other government agency partners, including Department of Commerce and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations. 
By focusing its combined resources through the enforcement task force, CBP will be able to combat illicit traders that illegally exploit American trade and conduct enforcement operations at and beyond the border to ensure U.S. industry can compete on a level playing field.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between the official ports of entry. CBP is charged with keeping terrorists and terrorist weapons out of the country while enforcing hundreds of U.S. laws.

S. 2970, a bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to expand law enforcement availability pay to employees of the Air and Marine Operations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection
June 14, 2016
Cost Estimate
As ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and and Governmental Affairs on May 25, 2016
View Document
85.8 KB
Summary
S. 2970 would change the system for determining overtime compensation for certain employees of Air and Marine Operations in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Based on information from CBP, CBO estimates that implementing S. 2970 would reduce costs by about $2 million annually or $10 million over the 2017-2021 period, assuming future appropriations are reduced consistent with the bill’s provisions. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting S. 2970 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027.
Under current law, about 500 law enforcement officers in Air and Marine Operations are eligible for overtime compensation under three different schedules: the Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO), the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and the Federal Employee Pay Act (FEPA). Total overtime costs for those officers, including pay and benefits, totaled $18 million in 2015. Their total base pay was $46 million in that year.
Under S. 2970, law enforcement officers in Air and Marine Operations would no longer be eligible for overtime compensation under AUO or the FLSA. The bill would make them eligible for Law Enforcement Availability Pay, and they would remain eligible for FEPA overtime pay. Costs would decline under S. 2970 mostly because the affected officers would no longer receive compensation required under the FLSA. According to CBP, if the overtime pay system in S. 2970 had been implemented for fiscal year 2015, total overtime costs for the affected officers would have been about $16 million, or about $2 million lower than the actual overtime expense for that year for those officers.

Abstract
In this article we undertake a systematic analysis of why border enforcement backfired as a strategy of immigration control in the United States. We argue theoretically that border enforcement emerged as a policy response to a moral panic about the perceived threat of Latino immigration to the United States propounded by self-interested bureaucrats, politicians, and pundits who sought to mobilize political and material resources for their own benefit. The end result was a self-perpetuating cycle of rising enforcement and increased apprehensions that resulted in the militarization of the border in a way that was disconnected from the actual size of the undocumented flow. Using an instrumental variable approach, we show how border militarization affected the behavior of unauthorized migrants and border outcomes to transform undocumented Mexican migration from a circular flow of male workers going to three states into an eleven-million person population of settled families living in 50 states.
From 1986 to 2008 the undocumented population of the United States grew from three million to 12 million persons, despite a five-fold increase in Border Patrol officers, a four-fold increase in hours spent patrolling the border, and a 20-fold increase in nominal funding. Whether measured in terms personnel, patrol hours, or budget, studies indicate that the surge in border enforcement had little effect in reducing unauthorized migration to the United States (Hanson and Spilimbergo 1999; Hanson, Robertson, and Spilmbergo 2002; Davila, Pagan, and Soydemir 2002; Hanson and McIntosh 2009, 2010; Massey and Riosmena 2010; Angelucci 2012; Massey, Durand, and Pren 2014). The strategy of enhanced border enforcement was not without consequences, however, for research also suggests that it reduced the rate of return migration and redirected migrant flows to new sectors along the border with Arizona and then toward new destinations throughout the United States (Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002; Massey and Capoferro 2004; Carrión-Flores and Sorensen 2006; Gathmann 2008; Kaufman 2008; Bohn and Pubatch 2013; Rocha et al. 2014; Massey, Durand, and Pren 2014).
In this article, we explain how and why the unprecedented militarization of the Mexico-U.S. border not only failed in its attempt to reduce undocumented migration, but backfired by increasing the rate of undocumented population growth and turning what had been a circular flow of male workers going to three states into a settled population of families living in 50 states. The logic of using enhanced border enforcement as a strategy for immigration control was laid out by Todaro and Maruszko (1987), who drew upon neoclassical economics to conceptualize migration as a cost-benefit decision taken to maximize lifetime earnings. According to their model, potential migrants consider expected earnings in places of origin and destination and compute the difference to derive the expected gain from migration, which is then projected into the future subject to temporal discounting. Then they estimate the cost of migration and subtract it from the expected increase in lifetime earnings to determine the expected net gain from migration. The greater the expected gain the higher the probability of migration to a particular location. In theory, then, enhanced border enforcement works by raising the costs of migration enough to offset an expected earnings gain, thus reducing the likelihood of undocumented migration,
It is rather doubtful, of course, that the choice of border enforcement as a policy instrument was predicated on a careful application of neoclassical theory. Indeed, here we argue that the strategy of enhanced border enforcement emerged as a result of actions undertaken by self-interested politicians, bureaucrats, and pundits who framed undocumented migration as crisis without regard to its underlying realities. In order to explain observed patterns and trends in unauthorized migration, therefore, the behavior of these actors must be theorized and the consequences of their actions specified, moving explanation beyond the usual social and economic determinants.
Having developed our theoretical argument for the emergence of border enforcement as a strategy for immigration control, we undertake a comprehensive empirical analysis not only of migratory decisions, but also the behavior of undocumented migrants at the border and the outcomes they achieve when trying to cross. Unlike most prior analyses, we draw on instrumental variable methods to identify the causal effects of border enforcement, focusing on key junctures in the social process of undocumented migration: the decision to depart for the United States without legal authorization, the choice of place of crossing, whether or not to use a crossing guide, the cost of crossing with a guide, the likely risk of death during crossing, the likelihood of apprehension at the border, the probability of ultimately achieving a successful entry, and the likelihood of returning home once entry has been achieved (Singer and Massey 1998). We conclude with a summary of results and a discussion of their implications for understanding international migration and thinking about immigration policy today.

ILLEGAL MIGRATION, THE LATINO THREAT, AND THE BORDER
The rise of illegal migration goes back 1965, when Congress passed amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act that placed the first-ever numerical limits on immigration from the Western Hemisphere, while at the same time cancelling a longstanding guest worker agreement with Mexico (Massey and Pren 2012a). Subsequent amendments to the Act further tightened numerical limits until by the late 1970s Mexico was placed under a quota of just 20,000 legal resident visas per year and no temporary work visas at all, as compared with 50,000 permanent resident entries and 450,000 temporary work entries in the late 1950s (Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002).
The conditions of labor supply and demand had not changed, however, and network connections between Mexican workers and U.S. employers were well established by the mid-1960s. As a result, once opportunities for legal entry constricted, migration did not stop but simply continued under undocumented auspices (Massey and Pren 2012a). By 1979 the annual inflow of Mexican workers had returned back to levels that prevailed in the late 1950s. As during the Bracero Era, migration during the Undocumented Era was overwhelmingly circular (Massey and Singer 1995), causing the undocumented population grow slowly, reaching two million by 1980 (Warren and Passel 1987). Even legal “permanent residents” at this time tended to circulate back and forth. According to Warren and Kraly (1985), annual out-migration by legal Mexican immigrants averaged about 20% of annual in-migration during the 1970s; and Jasso and Rosenzweig (1982) estimate that 56 percent of legal Mexican immigrants who arrived in 1970 had returned home by 1979.
In practical terms, then, little had changed between the late 1950s and the late 1970s: similarly sized flows of migrants were circulating across the border and going to the same destinations in the same U.S. states. In symbolic terms, however, the situation had changed dramatically for now the vast majority of the migrants were “illegal” and thus by definition “criminals” and “lawbreakers.” The rise of illegal migration created an opening for political entrepreneurs of various stripes to cultivate a new politics of fear, framing Latino immigration as a grave threat to the nation (Santa Anna 2002; Abrajano and Hajnal 2015). Chavez (2001, 2008) has documented the steady rise of what he calls the “Latino Threat Narrative” in the U.S. media from the 1970s through the 1990s, and Massey and Pren (2012a) likewise found that newspaper mentions of Mexican immigration as a crisis, flood, or invasion rose in tandem with border apprehensions from 1965 to 1979, pushing public opinion in a more conservative, anti-immigrant direction (Massey and Pren 2012b; Valentino, Brader, and Jardina 2012).
Human social cognition characteristically operates to classify people and groups on the basis of their perceived warmth and competence (Fiske et al. 2002; Fiske 2003). Ingroup members and others like them are viewed as both warm (approachable and well-intended) and competent (capable and effective), triggering positive emotions such as pride and esteem. Outgroups fall into three categories associated with different combinations of warmth and competence. Envied outgroups are perceived as competent but not warm (e.g. the rich and certain middleman minorities); pitied outgroups are seen as warm but incompetent (e.g. the elderly, the disabled); and despised outgroups are viewed as neither warm nor competent and are viewed with disdain and disgust (e.g. drug dealers, the homeless).
The location of any particular group in the social space defined by warmth and competence is not given but manufactured through psychological and social mechanisms. Psychologically, a group’s location is determined through cognitive processes of framing (Kahneman and Tversky 2000) and socially through mechanisms of boundary definition and reification (Lamont and Molnar 2002; Wimmer 2008). The rise of illegal migration created a golden opportunity for self-interested actors to engage in the systematic framing of illegal migrants as criminals, portraying them as neither warm nor competent and thus distinguished from mainstream Americans by a well-defined social boundary. The success of their efforts is indicated by research showing that illegal migrants, Mexicans, and Latinos general have now come to occupy the low-warmth/low-competence quadrant of disgust in American social cognition (Lee and Fiske 2006). Groups in this location are subject to systematic dehumanization and viewed with contempt and fear (Harris and Fiske 2006).
Fear, of course, is a well-established tool for political mobilization and resource acquisition (Robin 2006; Gardner 2008). The possibility of using mechanisms of framing and boundary definition to exploit the psychological proclivities of human social cognition and create a fearful outgroup always exists. As a result, across history it has proved difficult for humans to resist the temptation to cultivate fear and loathing of outsiders in order to achieve self-serving goals. In response to the advent of illegal migration after 1965, three prominent categories of social actors succumbed to this temptation: bureaucrats, politicians, and pundits.
The bureaucratic charge was led in 1976 by the Commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Leonard F. Chapman, who published an article in Reader’s Digest entitled ""Illegal Aliens: Time to Call a Halt!"", warning Americans that a new ""silent invasion"" was threatening the nation:
When I became commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in 1973, we were out-manned, under-budgeted, and confronted by a growing, silent invasion of illegal aliens. Despite our best efforts, the problem---critical then---now threatens to become a national disaster. Last year, an independent study commissioned by the INS estimated that there are 8 million illegal aliens in the United States. At least 250,000 to 500,000 more arrive each year. Together they are milking the U.S. taxpayer of $13 billion annually by taking away jobs from legal residents and forcing them into unemployment; by illegally acquiring welfare benefits and public services; by avoiding taxes (Chapman 1976: 188–189).
Chapman went on to argue for the passage of restrictive immigration legislation then pending in Congress, contending that it was ""desperately needed to help us bring the illegal alien threat under control"" because ""the understaffed [Immigration] Service vitally needs some budget increases."" The numbers Chapman cited were entirely made up and no “independent study” was ever released. The figures were, however, useful in defining illegal migrants as both a realistic threat (“taking away jobs and milking the taxpayer”) and a symbolic threat (morally suspect welfare deadbeats and tax cheats), following the classic logic of intergroup threat theory elaborated by Stephan and colleagues (Stephan and Renfro 2002; Stephan, Ybarra, and Morrison 2015). Demographic estimates later put the actual number of unauthorized immigrants present in 1976 at around 1.3 million rather than the eight million he claimed (Warren and Passel 1987); but the latter number was, of course, more impressive in trying to goad Congress and the public into providing additional funding to his agency.
The most prominent politician contributing to the Latino Threat Narrative was President Ronald Reagan, who in 1985 declared undocumented migration to be ""a threat to national security"" and warned that “terrorists and subversives [are] just two days driving time from [the border crossing at] Harlingen, Texas” and that Communist agents were ready “to feed on the anger and frustration of recent Central and South American immigrants who will not realize their own version of the American dream” (Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002:87). More recently, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona mobilized citizens and accumulated substantial financial resources to become the most popular politician in the state making mass arrests of Latino “illegals,” symbolically assuring non-Hispanic whites that he was taking action “on illegal immigration, drugs and everything else that threatens America” (Arpaio and Sherman 2008).
Pundits made their contributions to the Latino Threat Narrative in order to sell books and boost media ratings. TV personality Lou Dobbs (2006) told Americans that the “invasion of illegal aliens” was part of a broader “war on the middle class.” Political commentator and author Patrick Buchanan (2006) alleged that illegal migration was part of an “Aztlan Plot” hatched by Mexican elites to recapture lands lost in 1848, stating that “if we do not get control of our borders and stop this greatest invasion in history, I see the dissolution of the U.S. and the loss of the American southwest” (Time, 28 August, p. 6). Academic pundit and policy advisor Samuel Huntington (2004), meanwhile, portrayed Latino immigrants as a threat to America’s national identity, warning that “the persistent inflow of Hispanic immigrants threatens to divide the United States into two peoples, two cultures, and two languages…. The United States ignores this challenge at its peril.”
Of course, none of the foregoing pronouncements was based on any substantive understanding of the realities of undocumented migration, much less any real evidence. At best they were distortions designed to cultivate fear and disgust among native born white Americans for self-interested purposes. Despite ample research and findings challenging the portrayal of illegal migration as an out-of-control invasion threatening U.S. society, the Latino Threat Narrative kept being repeated and proved remarkably resilient and durable over time. As Upton Sinclair pointed out, “it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it;” and so it was with the politicians, pundits, and bureaucrats who framed Latino immigration as a crisis and illegal aliens as a threatening outgroup.
As a result, even though the actual inflow of undocumented migrants had stabilized by the late 1970s and was no longer rising, the Latino Threat Narrative kept gaining traction to generate a rising moral panic about illegal aliens that produced a self-perpetuating increase in resources dedicated to border enforcement (Flores-Yeffal, Vidales, and Plemons 2011; Massey and Pren 2012a). Over time, as more Border Patrol Officers were hired and given more equipment and materiel, they apprehended more migrants. The rising number of border apprehensions was then taken as self-evident proof of the ongoing ""alien invasion,"" justifying agency requests for still more enforcement resources and ultimately yielding a self-feeding cycle of enforcement, apprehensions, more enforcement, more apprehensions, and still more enforcement that lasted through 2008 (Massey and Pren 2012a).
To this day, politicians, pundits, and bureaucrats continue to call for more border enforcement, despite the fact that net undocumented migration has been zero or negative since 2008, with unauthorized entries and exits in rough balance (Passel Cohn, and Gonzalez-Barrera. 2013). Apprehensions are at record low levels and in 2014 for the first time most of those caught at the border were not Mexicans but Central Americans. Nonetheless, calls for more border enforcement continue because the Mexico-U.S. border has become the preeminent symbolic line separating Americans from any and all external threats. Whether the threat is Al-Qaeda, ISIS, or Ebola the reflexive policy response offered by politicians to reassure citizens is more border enforcement. As Representative Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) put it, “there’s a longstanding history in this country of projecting whatever fears we have onto the border. In the absence of understanding the border, they insert their fears. Before it was Iran and Al Queda. Now it’s ISIS. They just reach the conclusion that invasion is imminent, and it never is” (quoted in Schmidt 2015).

HYPOTHESIZED CONSEQUENCES OF BORDER ENFORCEMENT
By any standard, the surge in border enforcement after 1986 constituted a massive policy intervention into the workings of a vast and complex social and economic system that had evolved since the 1940s in response to changing social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border (Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002). Critically, this massive intervention was undertaken for domestic political purposes and not based on a rational assessment of the forces actually driving undocumented migration or a reasoned consideration of how one might manage it. Whenever a policy is derived in a climate of fear without any real understanding of the actual workings of the social or economic system it aspires to influence, the stage is set for unintended consequences.
The neoclassical model of Todaro and Maruszko (1987) viewed undocumented migration as permanent rather than temporary, with workers moving to maximize lifetime earnings abroad; but as already noted, Mexican migration prior to 1986 was heavily circular, a pattern that is consistent with other, alternative theoretical models. The New Economics of Labor Migration argues that households use international migration as a means of managing risk and overcoming a lack of access to capital and credit at home; so instead of moving abroad permanently they send out migrants temporarily to generate an income stream that enables them to self-insure against local economic dislocations and to accumulate savings for investment and consumption at home in the absence of accessible markets for capital and credit (Stark and Bloom 1985; Taylor 1986; Stark 1991).
In addition, Dustmann and Görlach (2015) have recently shown that the neoclassical model of Todaro and Maruszko (1987) is but a special case of a more general theory of migrant decision-making and that wage differentials constitute the primary determinant of migration only under certain restrictive conditions, such as when preferences for consumption in both countries are identical; when national currencies do not differ in purchasing power; and when there is no skill accumulation abroad. They demonstrate that departures from these conditions lead to a variety of theoretically expected rationales for workers to prefer temporary over permanent international migration even under neoclassical assumptions.
Social capital theory, meanwhile, holds that within any migration system networks develop and extend over time to provide a social infrastructure capable of supporting and sustaining international migration in the face of obstacles and barriers (Massey et al. 1998). Through network connections migrants gain access to information and assistance for unauthorized border crossing. Aspiring migrants arrive at the border and through their social networks locate a border smuggler, or coyote, who is then contracted to lead the way across the frontier for a price, with higher prices generally increasing the odds of a successful entry (Singer and Massey 1998; Spener 2009).
Border enforcement, of course, does nothing to address the economic drivers of migration—persistent labor demand and high wages in the United States and an abundant labor supply and low wages in Mexico—nor does it take into account the existence of well-developed networks able to support and sustain undocumented border crossing and thus circumvent enforcement effots. Under these circumstances, we argue that the militarization of the border cannot be expected to deter undocumented migrants from coming, but will simply induce them to adjust their border-crossing strategies while continuing to migrate to readily available jobs in the United States. An important constraint from the U.S. side is that the border is long and enforcement resources necessarily must be targeted to specific sectors. As a result, the hardening of the border at one location will lead migrants to shift to new, less patrolled, likely more remote and riskier crossing sites, and to make more frequent use of coyotes and to pay them more for higher quality, and more effective services. We hypothesize that these costs will not be sufficient to offset expected gains of unauthorized labor in the United States.
We thus argue that strategic adjustments made by migrants will substantially offset the Border Patrol’s enforcement efforts to create a high likelihood of successful entry and thus enable continued access to the U.S. labor market. Rather than discouraging departure, therefore, the rising costs and risks associated with the new crossing strategies will create a disincentive for return migration. Specifically, we predict that migrants will extend the duration of their stays north of the border, both to cover the increased costs of border crossing and also to put off the physical risks of clandestine crossings in the future. The longer migrants remain in the United States, of course, the more likely they are to settle (Massey 1986) and, in the end, enhanced border enforcement will backfire by pairing continued in-migration with falling out-migration and thus increasing in the net undocumented inflow.

DATA AND METHODS
In order to assess the actual consequences of border enforcement on migrant behaviors and border outcomes we draw upon detailed histories of border crossing compiled by the Mexican Migration Project (Durand and Massey 2004), supplementing this information with administrative data on social and economic conditions prevailing on each side of the border. Since 1982 the MMP has conducted random household surveys in selected communities throughout Mexico while compiling respondent-driven samples of households from those same communities that have settled in the United States. Data are collected using combination of ethnographic and survey methods to compile detailed household data and gather full life histories from all household heads.
The accuracy and general representativeness of the MMP data have been validated by systematic comparisons with data from nationally representative samples (Massey and Zenteno 2000; Massey and Capoferro 2004) and are publicly available from the project website at http://mmp.opr.princeton.edu/, which contains complete documentation on sample design, questionnaires, and data files. Here we make use of the MMP143 database, which includes surveys of undocumented migrants originating in 143 Mexican communities. Although the MMP originally focused on five states in west-central Mexico which historically accounted for at least half the total outflow(Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacán, San Luís Potosí, and Zacatecas), as new origin areas emerged MMP investigators expanded data collection efforts geographically, ultimately compiling samples from 24 of Mexico's 32 states. The states included in the MMP143 database together account for 90% of all undocumented migrants who registered to obtain a Mexican consular identification card (Massey, Rugh, and Pren 2010).
In total, the database contains information on 151,785 persons surveyed in 23,851 households plus life histories covering 1,151489 person years lived by household heads. To these data we add yearly information on social and socioeconomic conditions in Mexico and the United States. Independent variables used in the analysis are listed and defined in Table 1. The principal variable of interest is the Border Patrol budget in $2013 constant collars, compiled from records of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and shown in Figure 1, which we take as our indicator of the intensity of border enforcement.

We prefer this measure to linewatch hours (the total time spent by agents patrolling the border in a given year) or the number Border Patrol agents (which is highly correlated with the former) because border enforcement has come to involve much more than personnel actions and now relies heavily on drones, sensors, helicopters, planes, satellites, and other materiel such as walls and fences, in addition to just person power. The budget captures these capital investments in enforcement in ways that personnel counts and linewatch hours do not, though we obtained the same results in earlier work using a factor scale that combined linewatch hours, Border Patrol Officers, Border Patrol budget, and deportations (Massey, Durand, and Pren 2014). The foregoing analysis, however, did not use instrumental variables and did not examine behavior and outcomes at the border, just departure and return decisions.
The use of the Border Patrol Budget to measure the U.S. enforcement effort presents two methodological problems, however. The first and more fundamental problem concerns endogeneity---the possibility that both border enforcement and undocumented migration may simultaneously be caused by a common underlying but unmeasured factor, or perhaps more likely, that the intensity of enforcement is itself determined by the volume of undocumented migration. Following Angelucci (2012) we used the budget of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as an instrument to predict the Border Patrol Budget and using the Wu-Hausman test with several specifications of the instrumental variable (Greene 2012) we indeed found statistical evidence of endogeneity with respect to the outcomes considered here (p<0.05), especially the likelihood of departing on first and later undocumented trips, the probability of returning from later undocumented trips, the place of border crossing, and the use of a paid guide.
According to Angrist and Krueger (2001:73), '' a good instrument is correlated with the endogenous regressor for reasons the researcher can verify and explain, but uncorrelated with the outcome variable for reasons beyond its effect on the endogenous regressor.'' The DEA and Border Patrol budgets both rise over time in similar fashion, but for very different reasons. The growth of the DEA is rooted in the politics of the war on crime and drugs (see Tonry 1995; Western 2006; Alexander 2010); but as noted above the growth of the Border Patrol's budget is grounded in manufactured hysteria over the ""alien invasion"" and the ensuring “war on immigrants” (Dunn 1996; Rotella 1998; Andreas 2000; Nevins 2010). The independence of the two ""wars"" is indicated by their separate legislative histories.
The war on crime was declared in 1970 by Richard Nixon in his State of the Union Speech and enacted by his signing of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, which led to the creation of the DEA in 1972. In 1981 Congress passed the Law Enforcement Act, which funded a new Narcotics Task Force in the DEA to provide state and local police access to military resources. In 1982, Ronald Reagan supplemented the war on crime by declaring a war on drugs and followed up in 1984 by launching Operation Pipeline, which funded the training of state and local police to use traffic stops as a pretext for drug searches. Legislation enacted in 1984 authorized the DEA and other law enforcement agencies to seize property suspected of being used in drug trafficking and to retain the proceeds from asset forfeiture. In 1986 Reagan issued a national security directive designating drugs as a threat to national security and signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which allocated $100 million for prison construction. In 1988 the Reagan Administraton established the Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, which authorized large cash grants to agencies as an inducement to make drug enforcement a priority and funded the DEA to provide free training and support to state and local authorities willing to commit to drug interdiction (the foregoing legislative history comes from Alexander 2010).
In contrast, the militarization of the border began later, in 1986 with the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which authorized a 50% increase in the INS enforcement budget (Bean et al. 1988). In 1990, Congress passed additional amendments to the Immigration and National Act which authorized the hiring of 1,000 more Border Patrol Officers. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act provided still more funding to the Border Patrol to purchase military equipment and hire 1,000 officers per year until it reached 10,000 total officers. The 2001 USA PATRIOT Act created the Department of Homeland Security and increased the size of the Border Patrol’s budget by another $300 million while the 2004 National Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act provided more funds to the Border Patrol for equipment, aircraft, agents, immigration investigators, and detention centers. The 2006 Secure Fence Act authorized the Border Patrol to erect new fences, vehicle barriers, checkpoints, lighting and to purchase new cameras, satellites, and unmanned drones for use border enforcement. Finally, the 2010 Border Security Act funded the hiring 3,000 more Border Patrol agents and increased the agency’s budget by $244 million (Massey and Pren 2012a).
A second methodological issue is heteroscedasticity in the causal variable. As noted earlier, the Border Patrol Budget has increased exponentially after 1986 and is therefore characterized by nonlinearity and a highly skewed distribution. Taking the natural log of the Border Patrol budget produces a linear trend across time, normalizes the distribution, and improves the fit in six of the eight models we estimated while leaving the fit roughly the same in the remaining two models. After testing a variety of model specifications, we therefore chose the logged Border Patrol budget in constant dollars as our preferred measure of the enforcement effort.
When we regressed the log of the Border Patrol budget on the DEA budget we obtained an R2 of 0.97 with the following equation estimate: ln(BP Budget) = 5.435 + 0.001037*(DEA Budget). We used this equation to generate an instrumental version of the logged Border Patrol budget variable that we employed in all analyses to estimate the causal effect of U.S. border enforcement on migratory outcomes. Although we often use our models to generate predicted values for migratory outcomes from 1970 to 2010, the models themselves are estimated for years 1972 or later, owing to the constraint that the DEA budget only becomes available in that year. In order to check the validity of the IV estimation we examined residuals from equations predicting the likelihood of departing and returning from a first and later undocumented trip and found them to be uncorrelated with the Border Patrol budget instrument (with the correlation coefficients of 0.0015 and 0.0206 for first and later undocumented departures and 0.0024 and 0.0023 for first and later return trips).
In assessing the influence of border enforcement on undocumented migration, we included contextual controls for social and economic conditions on both sides of the border. On the U.S. side, we assess employment demand by computing the yearly percent change in employment using data from the U.S. Current Population Survey demand (obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor 2014). Access to legal visas is measured by the number of legal entries from Mexico using visas that permit work or residence in the United States (compiled from various Statistical Yearbooks obtained from the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics 2014). Finally, U.S. wages are assessed by computing the amount of money in constant $2013 that would be earned for working an eight hour day at the national minimum wage (U.S. Department of Labor 2014).
On the Mexican side, we obtained information on the minimum daily wage from Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Estadistíca y Geografía Informática (2014) converted into dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity. Economic opportunity is assessed using the annual percent change in Mexican GDP computed using data from Heston et al. (2014). Demographic pressures are assessed by including Mexico's crude birth rate 15 years before the year in question (a proxy for labor force growth) using data obtained from Mitchell (2007). Finally, the rise of narco-violence in recent years is captured by the homicide rate per 100,000 persons obtained from Aguirre Botello (2011) who culled the data from a variety of official sources.
In order to guard against multicolinearity in our contextual variables we examined correlations between changes in the log of the border patrol budget and changes in our leading economic indicators and found small values. The correlations between changes in enforcement effort and changes in U.S. employment, U.S. wages, Mexican GDP per capita, and Mexican wages were −0.13, 0.28, −0.24, and −0.17, respectively. Changes in access to legal visas and Mexican population growth were also uncorrelated with changes in the enforcement effort, with respective values of 0.28 and −0.27.
While examining the influence of contextual variables on migrant outcomes and behavior, we draw on MMP data to control for the individual and household circumstances of decision makers. Demographic background is measured by age, gender, marital status, and household composition. Human capital is assessed by labor force experience, education, U.S. experience, number of prior U.S. trips, and occupational skill. Access to social capital is captured by dummy variables indicating whether the respondent's parent and spouse had migrated before the person year in question, and by counts of the number of siblings and children who had migrated prior to the person year in question as well as the number of children born in the U.S. prior to that year. Access to social capital outside of kinship networks is assessed using the migration prevalence ratio, which is the number of people aged 15 and over who had ever been to the United States by the person year in question divided by the total population 15 and over. Physical capital is measured by dummy variables indicating household ownership of land, a home, and a business in each person year. Geography is controlled by including a dummy variable indicating residence in historical core states for U.S. migration and by dummy variables indicating community size.
In our assessment of the effect of border enforcement on undocumented migration we focus on eight outcomes. At the border we examine the mode of crossing, place of crossing, cost of crossing, and whether or not an apprehension occurred. Following our assessment of outcomes at the border we examine four key migratory decisions: whether to take a first undocumented trip, whether to take an additional undocumented trip; and whether to return from first undocumented trip; and whether to return from an additional undocumented trip. Our basic methodological approach is to regress each outcome on the set of variables listed in Table 1. Border outcomes are observed during the person-year in which a trip occurred and the unit of analysis is the trip, which is defined as a journey to the border that lasted either to the point of successful entry (possibly after multiple attempts) or return to the community of origin (after giving up).
The influence of independent variables on departure decisions are analyzed using discrete time event history models. For the initial departure, we follow household heads from the date of their entry into the labor force up to the point at which they make their first undocumented trip using logistic regression to predict whether or not a first trip occurred in year t+1 from variables defined in year t. For later trips we follow each migrant from the point of return from each trip up to the point at which they make the next undocumented trip, predicting whether or not an additional trip occurred in year t+1 from variables defined in year t. In contrast, return migration decisions are modeled cross-sectionally by using a simple logistic regression model to predict whether or not the migrant returned within 12 months of entering on the trip in question. Thus the units of analysis for departure decisions are thus person-years whereas the unit for the return decisions is the person year in which the trip is observed.

MIGRANT ACTIONS AND OUTCOMES AT THE BORDER
The militarization of the border was rolled out in stages and enacted in different sectors at different times. Encountering a sudden deployment of personnel and materiel in El Paso in 1993 and San Diego in 1994, migrants quickly shifted their crossing efforts to other less militarized segments of the border (see Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002). Figure 2 draws upon MMP data to plot trends in the place of unauthorized border crossing between 1970 and 2010. The solid line indicates the relative share of undocumented migrants crossing at traditional locations in California (San Diego and Calexico) and Texas (El Paso and adjacent territory in New Mexico). From 1970 through 1988 70% to 80% of all undocumented migrants crossed at these locations, with no real trend upward or downward. During this time, undocumented border crossing became a routine, ritualized encounter between migrants and Border Patrol Officers that unfolded mainly within two urbanized segments of the border (Massey et al. 1987; Heyman 1995; Singer and Massey 1998).
Figure 2
Observed probability of crossing at a traditional location and probability predicted from Border Patrol budget
Although full-scale militarization did not occur in El Paso until 1993 and San Diego until 1994, the enforcement resources authorized by IRCA in 1986 were initially targeted to these two busiest border sectors. As a result, the share of crossings at traditional sites began to decline as early as 1988, falling from 70% in that year to 59% in 1995. In the wake of the two border blockade operations, however, the decline accelerated perceptibly and continued to fall sharply over the next several years, reaching a low of 30% in 2003 before rebounding somewhat to 44% in 2008 before falling again to reach an all-time low of 25% in 2010. Rather than crossing into California, El Paso, or adjacent portions of New Mexico, between 1988 and 2003 migrants increasingly moved through the Sonoran Desert toward new crossing points along the border with Arizona, which had not been a significant corridor for Mexican migrants since the 1920s (Massey, Durand, and Capoferro 2005; Massey and Capoferro 2008).
In order to test the extent to which this marked shift in the geography of border crossing stemmed from the rise in border enforcement, we used a logistic model to regress whether undocumented migrants crossed at a traditional location (1 if yes, 0 otherwise) on our Border Patrol budget instrument while controlling for the other variables listed in Table 1. The resulting equation estimates are presented in the first set of columns in Table 2. In assessing border outcomes, as opposed to decision-making about departures and returns (to which we turn in the next section), we focus interpretation on the estimated effects of the Border Patrol budget instrument (in the interests of saving time and space) with little or no comment on other estimated coefficients, which readers of course are free to inspect.

As hypothesized, border enforcement has a strong and significant negative effect on the likelihood of a crossing at a traditional location, despite the many other significant effects in the model. In order to illustrate more concretely the effect of enforcement on the geography of unauthorized border crossing, we inserted logged values of the Border Patrol budget into the equation of Table 2 while holding all other variables constant at their means, thereby generating predicted values that are plotted as a dashed line in Figure 2. Although there are many departures from the predicted trend owing to variation in other independent variables, the predicted values very clearly trace the downward trajectory of traditional border crossings over time, indicating analytically that the militarization of the border was the principal cause underlying the pronounced decline observed after the mid-1980s.
As migrants were diverted away from relatively safe and well-trod pathways in urban areas into more remote, isolated, and environmentally hostile sectors of the border, crossings grew increasingly difficult and hazardous and the share relying on the services of a paid guide, which had always been high, steadily rose. The solid line in Figure 3 shows the trend in the percentage of undocumented migrants who used a paid guide, or coyote, to cross the border from 1970 to 2010. Starting from usage levels around 70% in the early 1970s the utilization of coyotes increased steadily increased over time to reach 100% by 2010. As before, to assess the degree to which this trend stemmed from rising border enforcement, we used a logistic model to regress use of a coyote (1 if yes, 0 otherwise) on the Border Patrol budget instrument controlling for other variables in Table 1.
Figure 3
Observed probability of crossing with a coyote and probability predicted from Border Patrol budget
The results of this estimation are presented in the second two columns of Table 2 and reveal border enforcement to have had a very powerful positive influence on the likelihood of crossing with a coyote. In order to observe the trend in coyote usage predicted by the rising enforcement budget we used the same procedure as before, inserting logged values of the Border Patrol budget into the equation holding other factors constant at their mean values to generate predictions, which are again plotted as a dashed line in Figure 3. Once more it is very clear that rising border enforcement is the underlying cause of the temporal shift toward a higher likelihood of crossing with paid guides. In essence, the militarization of the border transformed coyote usage from a common practice that was followed by most migrants into a universal practice adopted by all migrants.
As border crossing increasingly moved into remote locations that were far from ultimate points of employment and settlement, the services provided by coyotes became increasingly complicated, involved, and costly. Figure 4 documents the resultant effect on crossing costs by showing the trend in the cost of a coyote in constant dollars from 1970 through 2010. Crossing costs generally trended slowly downward in real terms during the 1970s and early 1980s as networks expanded and border crossing became institutionalized, going from $700 in 1970 to around $550 in 1982 where it basically remained through 1989. Thereafter coyote costs begin a rapid rise to reach $1,900 in 2000 and $2,700 in 2010.
Figure 4
Observed trend in coyote costs and costs predicted from Border Patrol budget and place of crossing
In a sense, then, the neoclassical strategy of enhanced border enforcement worked in the sense that it increased the costs of unauthorized border crossing, which authorities hoped would reduce the expected net benefits to undocumented migration. To establish the connection between border enforcement and the costs of migration analytically we estimated a Tobit model to predict coyote costs as a function of the Border Patrol budget instrument and control variables, adding in place of crossing as an additional independent variable (see the third set of columns in Table 2). According to our estimates, the effect of border enforcement had a significant and positive effect on crossing costs, raising them by $732 for each point increase in the log of the Border Patrol budget. Moreover, like Gathmann (2008) we found that crossing through the remote Sonoran desert into Arizona was associated with higher crossing costs, raising them by about $166 per trip.
Following our by now familiar procedure, we inserted the log of the Border Patrol budget into the estimated equation along with observed proportions crossing in non-traditional sectors and mean values of other controls to generate predicted crossing costs, which are plotted as the dashed line in Figure 4. In this case, the observed rise in crossing costs corresponds very closely to the trend predicted from the enforcement budget, clearly pointing to the militarization of the border as the primary cause for the rise in coyote prices.
The ultimate border outcome of interest to policy makers is not where or how migrants attempt to cross into the United States, but whether they are apprehended and ever manage to gain entry. The solid line in Figure 5 shows the observed probability of apprehension during a migrant's first attempt at border crossing, computed from MMP border crossing histories. Obviously the exponential increase in border enforcement did not proportionately translate into higher apprehension probabilities. For most of the 1970s the probability of apprehension during crossing varied narrowly between 0.37 and 0.42. After 1978 it began to trend downward to reach a nadir of 0.21 in 1989. Thereafter the probability rose back upward to peak at a value of 0.44 in 2009. The curve of apprehensive probabilities clearly does not show any response to the exponential increase in the enforcement effort.
Figure 5
Observed probabilities of apprehension on first attempt and eventual entry and apprehension probability predicted from trend in Border Patrol budget
The final columns in Table 2 confirm this impression by presenting estimates for an equation examining the effect of the Border Patrol budget instrument on the likelihood of apprehension (1 if yes, 0 otherwise), but also inserting observed values for the place of crossing, use of a coyote, and cost of crossing in addition the variables shown in Table 1. As expected, and consistent with prior work, a rising enforcement effort significantly increased the likelihood of apprehension. Although coyote usage itself has no significant statistical effect on the probability of apprehension, the quality of the smuggling services provided by coyotes do have a strong effect, assuming that quality is reflected in cost. According to the equation, for every 100 dollars more paid in crossing costs, the odds of apprehension fell by 1.1%.
When we inserted the log of the Border Patrol budget into the equation to generate predicted probabilities, however, we found that the resulting estimates increasingly over-stated observed apprehension probabilities as the years progressed; but when we inserted the observed trend in the cost of the coyote into the equation instead of the average cost, this over-prediction disappeared and these are the values plotted as a dashed line in Figure 5. In other words, rising enforcement did increase the probability of apprehension, but this effect was offset by the rising quality and elaborateness of the services provided by coyotes and in the end the massive increase in border enforcement had a rather modest effect on likelihood of apprehension, with the predicted probability from 0.24 to 0.44 over a period of four decades.
Whatever the probability of apprehension might be on any given attempted crossing, apprehended migrants are free to try again once they are returned to Mexico, and historically this is what virtually all migrants have done (Singer and Massey 1998; Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002). Until recently, Mexicans caught at the border did not undergo formal deportation proceedings, but simply signed a ""voluntary departure order"" that waived their right to a hearing and authorized the Border Patrol escort them ""voluntarily"" back across the border (Heyman 1995). Once in Mexico, they simply tried again until success was achieved, a practice that Espenshade (1990) called a ""repeated trials model"" of undocumented entry.
The degree to which repeated trials were successful in achieving entry is indicated by the dotted line shown at the top of Figure 5, which shows annual probabilities of ultimately gaining entry to the United States over multiple attempts on a single trip, where a trip constitutes one episode at the border no matter how many attempts were made and no matter what the outcome. Entry probabilities were virtually constant through 1998, running at or just below 1.0, indicating that eventual entry during this time was a near certainty. Between 1999 and 2008, the probability of entry varied between 0.95 and 0.98 but obviously remained quite high.
Although the entry probability dropped to a low of 0.75 in 2010, by then almost no Mexicans were attempting to cross in the first place, rendering the entry probability moot in determining the volume of undocumented migration. In the end, from 1970 to the year 2008, when net aggregate undocumented migration from Mexico went negative and stabilized at zero, the likelihood of ultimate entry into the United States never fell below 0.95, despite the massive increase in the budget and personnel of the Border Patrol. Indeed, when we tried to assess the effect of enforcement on the probability of entry into the United States with our usual logistic regression model, there was so little variation in the dependent variable that the model failed to converge.
As already noted, however, these successful crossings came at an increasing financial cost, and statistics on deaths among undocumented migrants along the border also suggest that it came at increasing physical cost as well. Figure 6 plots the number of border deaths as a solid line from 1985 to 2010, with data for 1985–1998 coming from Eschbach, Hagan, and Rodriguez (2001) and tallies for 1998–2012 coming from Anderson (2013). As can be seen, the number of border deaths actually fell from 1985 to 1993, going from 147 to 67 despite the rising number of attempts. Operation Blockade was unleashed in 1993, however, and was quickly followed by Operation Gatekeeper in 1994, which as we have already seen diverted undocumented flows into the dangerous territory of Sonoran desert. From 72 border deaths in 1994, the figure rose to peak at 482 deaths in 2005 before falling back to 365 in 2010. However, very few Mexicans were attempting an unauthorized border crossing in the 2010 and the number of dead was still five times that observed in the early 1990s when many hundreds of thousands of attempts were undertaken each year, implying a much higher death rate.
Figure 6
Observed deaths at the border and deaths predicted by trend in Border Patrol budget
The MMP does not keep track of deaths among migrants crossing into the United States, so we cannot estimate our usual model to assess the effect of rising enforcement on border mortality. Migrants who themselves died during an attempted crossing are not around to be included in the MMP, of course, and family members of those who perished at the border are likely reluctant to report events triggering painful memories. We can, however, regress the total number of border deaths shown in Figure 6 directly on the logged Border Patrol budget instrument, and when this is done we obtain an r2 of 0.64 with the following equation: Border Deaths = 116.261 + 86.032*(BP Instrument). Plugging annual values of the Border Patrol budget into this equation produces the dashed trend line shown in Figure 6, again pointing to rising enforcement as the principal cause of the growing toll of death along the Mexico-U.S. border. Using the model, we estimate that if the Border Patrol budget had remained at its 1986 value through 2010 there would have been a total of 5,119 fewer deaths along the border.

MIGRANT DEPARTURE AND RETURN DECISIONS
Considering the trends in apprehension and entry probabilities just described, it is evident that U.S. authorities have little to show for the billions spent on border enforcement between 1986 and 2010. The massive increase in enforcement spending had only a modest effect on the probability of apprehension and virtually no effect on the ultimate likelihood of entry. Although border enforcement may have failed to prevent the successful entry of undocumented migrants, however, it did have pronounced effects on migrants' behavior as they took evasive action to avoid capture, shifting away from traditional crossing locations to new staging areas in the Sonoran Desert and upping their already high reliance smugglers and paying them more money to help them get across. These changes, in turn, neutralized the modest effect on apprehension probabilities but led to a substantial increase in the financial costs and physical risks of undocumented border crossing.
Thus the context of migrant decision-making was clearly altered by U.S. border policies during the late 1980s and 1990s. Whereas during the 1970s and early1980s migrants knew they could come and go across the border at relatively low cost and risk and easily sustain a circular pattern of migration, by the mid-1990s and early 2000s the likelihood of getting into the United States remained high but the costs and risks of border crossing were dramatically higher, rendering a strategy of circular migration increasingly unattractive.
In addition to the rising costs of migration, post-IRCA research on the earnings of undocumented migrants also suggests that the ""tax"" or wage penalty paid by undocumented migrants increased after IRCA and thus likely reduced expected earnings in the United States (Cobb-Clark, Shiells, and Lowell 1995; Bansak and Raphael 1989). Phillips and Massey (1999), for example, found that whereas undocumented status had no effect on the wages earned by Mexican migrants before 1986, afterward it carried a 25% wage penalty. Likewise, Massey and Gentsch (2011) found that the earnings returns to U.S. experience in undocumented status dropped from five percent per year to zero under the new enforcement regime. In addition, after IRCA employers shifted increasingly to the indirect hiring of migrants through labor contractors, who pocketed a share of the wages that used to go to the migrants themselves (Taylor 1996; Martin 1996; Taylor, Martin, and Fix 1997; Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002).
Although U.S. policies may have decreased expected net earnings gain from undocumented migration by lowering wages and increasing crossing costs, the net differential in expected earnings between Mexico and the United States never came close to being eliminated. Under these circumstances, the changes induced by U.S. policies functioned less to deter undocumented migration than to compel migrants to work longer to earn back the costs of crossing and make the trip profitable. Moreover, having experienced the risks of a desert border crossing migrants would logically be loath to relive the experience. Finally, given longer stays north of the border and more attachments formed to people and places in the United States, permanent settlement is expected to become more likely. Given these changed circumstances at the border and within U.S. labor markets, we hypothesize little effect on the decision to depart for the United States without documents, but strong effects on the decision of undocumented migrants to return to Mexico.
Undocumented migration begins when an aspiring migrant decides to head northward without documents to attempt a first entry into the United States. In Figure 7 we draw on the migration histories compiled by the MMP to compute the probability of departing on a first trip to the United States, shown by the solid line. To generate these figures we followed household heads from the point of entry into the labor force up to the date of the first U.S. trip and predicted departure in year t+1 from variables defined in year t. The solid line in the figure was generated by using a logistic model to regress dummy variables for year t on whether the respondent departed in year t+1 (1 if yes, 0 otherwise) and the resulting coefficients were then used to generate departure probabilities.
Figure 7
Observed probability of first undocumented migration and probabilities predicted from trends in Border Patrol budget and average age
As might be expected given the volatility of political and economic conditions in the U.S. and Mexico from 1970 to 2010, there is considerable year-to-year fluctuation in the probability of taking a first undocumented trip. From 1971 to 1999 the probability of first departure fluctuated between 0.005 and 0.011 with no clear trend, but afterward probabilities of leaving without documents went into a steady, though jagged decline to levels near zero in 2009 and 2010, a pattern consistent with results from aggregate estimates, which indicate the end of undocumented migration after 2008 (Hoefer, Rytina, and Baker 2013; Passel, Cohn, and Gonzalez-Barrera 2013; Villareal 2014).
In order to assess the effect of different factors in promoting initial undocumented migration to the United States, we used a logistic model to regress first departure dummy variables on the independent variables shown in Table 1. All variables except obviously constant factors such as gender and region of origin are time-varying, thus yielding a discrete time event history analysis of first undocumented departure (Massey and Espinosa 1997). As can be seen in the first columns of Table 3, we find no evidence that the initiation of undocumented is reduced by greater border enforcement. Indeed, the coefficient for the Border Patrol budget instrument is positive, though statistically insignificant.

Among contextual factors on the U.S. side, the likelihood of taking a first undocumented trip is most strongly and positively predicted by U.S. employment growth and U.S. wage rates, while being negatively related to the relative availability of legal U.S. visas. On the Mexican side, undocumented departure is positively predicted by GDP growth and negatively predicted by Mexican wage rates. Moreover, as in prior studies using MMP data, the effects of social capital are strong and positive, with having a migrant parent, migrant siblings, migrant children, and coming from a community with a high migratory prevalence all significantly predicting the likelihood of a first undocumented departure. Only the presence of a spouse with prior U.S. experience and having U.S. born children negatively predict first departure.
In sum, undocumented Mexicans are most likely to depart on a first trip to the United States during periods when U.S. labor demand is high, when U.S. wages are elevated, when legal entry visas are scarce, when the Mexican economy is growing but Mexican wages are low and when potential migrants have abundant social connections to people with prior U.S. experience. With respect to demographic background, age displays the classic curvilinear pattern and the likelihood of taking a first unauthorized trip is significantly lower for women, those who are married, and those with minors present in the household. In terms of human capital, undocumented migration is negatively selected with respect to skill, with the likelihood of departure falling with rising years of education and increasing occupational skill. The ownership of land, homes, and businesses all reduce the odds of striking out on a first undocumented drip (financing the acquisition of such assets is a major motivation for migration). Finally, the likelihood of taking a first undocumented tip is greater among residents of the historical source region for U.S. migration and departure is more likely from towns and cities than from small rural villages once other factors are taken into account.
Given the insignificant positive sign on the coefficient for the Border Patrol budget instrument, we already know that border enforcement does not account for the secular decline in the odds of taking a first undocumented trip after 1999, and this surmise is confirmed by the flat dashed line plotted in Figure 7, derived again by inserting the log of the Border Patrol budget into the prediction equation along with mean values of other variables. In order to discover which factor best explains the drop in first migration probabilities we successively inserted observed values of U.S. and Mexican contextual factors to observe their effects on predicted values. We discovered that whereas shifting economic circumstances on both sides of the border accounted for the jagged ups and downs in departure probabilities from year to year, they did not predict the progressive downturn over time (results not shown).
Instead, the declining probability of undocumented departure during the 2000s was accounted for by the rising age of people at risk of taking a first trip, an effect indicated by the dotted line in Figure 7, which we generated by inserting the average age for each person year into the equation while holding other variables constant at their means. The average age of those in the labor force but lacking prior migratory experience steadily rose steadily from 23.4 in 1972 to 45.9 in 2010, a sharp increase that stems from two complementary dynamics: the sharp drop in Mexican childbearing from a Total Fertility Rate of 7.2 children per woman in 1965 to a value of 2.3 today and the steady selection of young men out of the population at risk of taking a first trip through migration itself.
Thus, as Hanson and McIntosh (2009) noted, the seeds for today's diminished rates of undocumented migration were sowed by changes in fertility that began four decades ago. As cohorts entering the labor force ages shrank after the mid-1990s and younger men who did arrive at labor force ages were steadily selected out to the United States (increasingly to stay, as we shall see), the average age of the pool of eligible first time migrants remaining in Mexico steadily and rapidly rose. Consistent with Hansen and McIntosh's results, our analysis suggests that the decline in new undocumented migration to the United States observed over the past decade or so had little or nothing to do with border enforcement and everything to do with Mexico's changing demography.
We know turn to an analysis of the decision to return from an initial undocumented trip north of the border. The solid line in Figure 8 shows the trend in the probability of returning to Mexico within a year of entry on a first U.S. trip. These figures were generated by estimating a logistic model to predict whether a return occurred during the 12 months subsequent to a first entry (1 if yes, 0 otherwise) using dummy variables for years and using the resulting coefficients to derive probabilities. As with departures, the likelihood of return varies jaggedly from year to year but generally ranges from 0.30 to 0.45 through 1999 when the probability declines sharply to reach zero by 2010, albeit with wide oscillations in the late 2000s owing to smaller numbers of first-time migrants in the United States.
Figure 8
Observed probability of return within 12 months of first undocumented trip and probability predicted from Border Patrol budget
In order to assess the degree to which rising border enforcement accounts for this downward trend, we used a logistic model to regress returning within 12 months (1 if yes, 0 otherwise) on the variables in Table 1 defined for the year in which the trip was initiated. The results of this operation are presented in the second set of columns in Table 3. The coefficient on the instrumental variable for the log of the border budget is negative and significant, confirming that rising enforcement did indeed cause a drop in the likelihood of return migration back to Mexico. Each point increase in the log of the Border Patrol budget lowered the likelihood of return by 41%.
Among contextual factors, on the U.S. side the likelihood of return migration is lowered by employment growth and rising wages (enabling migrants to achieve target incomes sooner rather than later). On the Mexican side, somewhat contrary to expectations, return migration is positively predicted by a rising homicide rate and negatively predicted by higher wages; but having a migrant parent, a migrant spouse, and migrant siblings are all associated with lower likelihoods of returning, as one would expect. Other things equal, then, return migration from a first undocumented trip tends to occur during periods of slack labor demand and low wages in the United States and higher violence and lower wages in Mexico but is especially likely among those who lack immediate family ties to U.S. migrants.
The primary force driving return probabilities down over time, however, is rising border enforcement, as confirmed by the dashed in in Figure 8 which shows predicted probabilities generated by inserting the logged Border Patrol budget into the equation while holding other variables constant at their means. Whereas the predicted probability fluctuated around 0.45 through 1984, after that date the likelihood of return migration moved steadily downward to reach a value of 0.17 in 2010, a decline of 62%.
Inserting U.S. and Mexican contextual factors into the equation while holding the Border Patrol budget constant at its mean replicates the zigzag configuration observed in the solid line but does not yield the observed post-2000 decline. Indeed, structural economic conditions on both sides of the border predict continued high rates of return migration (results not shown). If U.S. contextual factors were the only variables operating, the likelihood of return migration would have been 0.42 in 2010. Likewise, if Mexican factors were the only ones operating the probability of returning from a first trip would have been 0.56 in 2010. In essence, the border buildup prevented a continued high rate of return migration that otherwise would have occurred in its absence.
The foregoing analyses reveal that the exponential rise in border enforcement after 1986 had no effect on the likelihood of taking a first undocumented trip northward or the odds of gaining entry to the United States on such a trip, but that it did have a strong effect in decreasing the likelihood of returning to Mexico once an entry had been achieved. As a result, even though undocumented migrants continued to head northward, fewer come back and the circular migration of undocumented migrants wound down and eventually ceased as return probabilities approached zero. In our analysis, we also examined trends in the likelihood of taking an additional undocumented trip, given at least one prior trip and found that the probability of additional migration before 1986 was quite high, ranging from 0.14 to 0.18, with a sharp drop between 1986 and 1988 when many undocumented migrants who formerly had circulated remained north of the border to claim amnesty and legalize under IRCA. After 1989, however, we observe a steady decline in return probabilities toward zero by 2010.
In the interest of space we do not plot trends in the likelihood of repeat migration; but the third set of columns in Table 3 do present a discrete time event history model estimated to predict whether or not a migrant departed for the United States on an additional undocumented trip from the variables listed in Table 1. Here the estimated coefficient for the log of the Border Patrol budget instrument is −1.562, indicating that border enforcement had a very strong and highly significant effect in deterring additional undocumented migration to the United States. Over time fewer and fewer migrants were returning from their first trip, of course, and were no longer at risk of migrating again; and IRCA's legalization of some two million Mexicans permanent likewise removed a large number from the ranks of those eligible for recurrent undocumented migration. Increasingly after 1986 many fewer people were subject to the risk of taking an additional U.S. trip.
In addition the U.S. enforcement effort, the likelihood of taking another trip was reduced by a greater availability of legal U.S. visas and increased by higher wages in both Mexico and the United States. Rising human capital generally reduced the likelihood of taking an additional undocumented trip, with the odds of departure declining with rising labor force experience, age, cumulative U.S. experience, and occupational skill. Only prior U.S. trips positively predicted additional undocumented migration, which is not surprising given that a high number of prior trips itself indicates an established commitment to a strategy of recurrent migration (see Massey et al. 1987).
To round out our analyses, we also examined the decision to return to Mexico from an additional undocumented trip. To conserve space we again do not show these plots, which generally reveal a much lower likelihood of returning to Mexico than on first than later trips. From 1970 to 1985 the likelihood of return migration varied from 0.15 to 0.25, then fell to around 0.10 in 1988 before rising to peak at 0.30 in 2002 and then fell back again to around 0.15 in 2010. In the last two columns of Table 3 we present a model estimated to predict the likelihood of returning from an additional undocumented trip from the independent variables in Table 1. As on first trips, the effect of rising enforcement on the likelihood of return migration from an additional trip is negative, although the coefficient is smaller carries a lower significance.
As on first trips, the odds of return are decreased by employment growth in the United States and increased by high wages (again enabling the faster accumulation of target incomes). In addition, the likelihood of return migration is reduced by greater access to legal U.S. visas. Among Mexican factors, the odds of returning from an additional trip are reduced by high wages; and as other studies have shown, the likelihood of returning from an additional trip falls sharply as the number of prior trips and cumulative U.S. experience increase. With respect to social capital, the odds of returning from a later trip are also negatively predicted by education and having a migrant spouse, parents, siblings, and U.S.-born children.

CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
The principal substantive finding of our analysis is that border enforcement was not an efficacious strategy for controlling Mexican immigration to the United States, to say the least. Indeed, it backfired by cutting off a long-standing tradition of migratory circulation and promoting the large-scale settlement of undocumented migrants who otherwise would have continued moving back and forth across the border. This outcome occurred because the strategy of border enforcement was not grounded in any realistic appraisal of undocumented migration itself, but in the social construction of a border crisis for purposes of resource acquisition and political mobilization. Although these arguments have been made before, never before have instrumental variable methods been applied to such a wide range of border outcomes and migrant behaviors to assess the causal effect of U.S. border enforcement.
How Border Enforcement Failed
Our estimates reveal that the rapid escalation of border enforcement beginning in 1986 had no effect on the likelihood of initiating undocumented migration to the United States but did have powerful unintended consequences, pushing migrants away from relatively benign crossing locations in El Paso and San Diego into hostile territory in the Sonoran desert and through Arizona, increasing the need to rely on paid smugglers, and substantially increasing the costs and risks of undocumented migration. The increase in border enforcement, meanwhile, had only a modest effect on the likelihood that an undocumented migrant would be apprehended during a crossing attempt, one substantially mitigated by the greater use of coyotes and higher quality of services they offered, and no effect at all on the likelihood of gaining entry over a series of attempts.
The combination of increasingly costly and risky trips and the near certainty of getting into the United States created a decision-making context in which it still made economic sense to migrate but not to return home to face the high costs and risks of subsequent entry attempts. In response to the changed incentives, the probability of returning from a first trip fell sharply after the 1980s, going from a high of 0.48 in 1980 to zero in 2010, though with significant year-to-year variation connected to fluctuating social and economic conditions in Mexico and the United States. According to our instrumental variable estimates, if U.S. border enforcement were the only causal factor affecting the likelihood of return from a first trip, it would have fallen from a peak of 0.47 in 1981 to a low of 0.17 in 2010, a drop of roughly two-thirds in a little less than three decades.
In addition to curtailing return migration from first trips, rising border enforcement also reduced the likelihood of both taking and returning from additional undocumented trips, but these effects are substantively less important to understanding what happened after 1986 because IRCA's legalization removed so many people from the population eligible to take an additional undocumented trip, and because the sharp drop in return migration probabilities meant that fewer and fewer migrants were returning from the first trip to put themselves at risk of going again. The shift from sojourning to settling as a prevailing migration strategy is thus most evident in decisions to undertake and return from first trips.
Theoretical Implications
Our analysis has important theoretical implications, given that the transformation of Mexican migration from a regionally-limited circulation of male workers into a nationwide population of settled families occurred not because of changes in well-known social or economic determinants of international migration, but from policy decisions adopted for domestic political purposes. As we have argued, the adoption of heightened border enforcement as policy instrument arose not from a careful assessment of the social and economic forces driving undocumented migration, or even a theoretically informed interpretation of these forces, but from the actions of self-interested bureaucrats, politicians, and pundits who seized on the rise of illegal migration to frame Latino immigrants as “criminals” and “lawbreakers” who constituted a threat to the nation, thus setting in motion a moral panic that contributed to a self-perpetuating cycle of rising enforcement and increasing apprehensions that was disconnected to the underlying volume of undocumented migration.
We traced the origins of border enforcement as a policy strategy back to the rise of undocumented migration in response to the restriction of legal opportunities for entry from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America after 1965. The rise of a migrant stream that was “illegal” proved irresistible to social entrepreneurs in politics, government bureaucracies, and the media, who deployed psychological framing devices and social mechanisms of boundary reification to exploit characteristic tendencies in human social cognition and turn Latino immigrants into a despised outgroup, one that inspired fear and loathing and merited harsh exclusionary treatment. As a result of these actions, entrepreneurial actors benefitted, with increased funding for the immigration bureaucrats, mobilized constituencies for politicians, and increased media ratings and book sales for pundits. Although they may even have believed their own assertions, one must be skeptical of arguments that carry a clear benefit for the people that make them.
The combined actions of the foregoing entrepreneurs drove forward a politics of immigrant exclusion that settled on border enforcement as the favored policy tool, and it was the widespread and intensive application of this tool that generated a rising tide of apprehensions that itself served to justify ever greater enforcement efforts and bring about the full-scale militarization of the Mexico-U.S. border. Ultimately this militarization failed to reduce undocumented entry but paradoxically did reduce the rate of return migration to increase the net rate of unauthorized migration and increase undocumented population growth, while also altering the geography of border crossing and destination selection. In the end, a circular flow of male workers going to a handful of states was transformed into a settled population of families dispersed throughout the nation.
Our theoretical conclusion is that that, in the end the observed trajectory of Mexico-U.S. migration since 1965 cannot be explained by the usual set of social and economic determinants alone, for its path was powerfully determined by the by the consequences of choosing border enforcement as a strategy for immigration control, a choice that we theorized as a product of self-interested actions by politicians, bureaucrats, and pundits who deliberately manufactured a moral panic to mobilize constituencies and acquire resources with little regard for the actual consequences.
Policy Implications
In order to quantify the effect of American reliance on border enforcement as a strategy for immigration control, we undertook a simple simulation. Beginning with a Mexican population of 50.7 million in 1970 (Mexico's actual population size) and assuming no undocumented migrants residing in the United States on that date (likely close to true) and rate of natural increase of 2% over the next 40 years (the actual Mexican growth rate) we projected the population ahead under two scenarios. In the first scenario we use the observed budget of the Border Patrol to predict probabilities of departure and return from a first U.S. trip using the models in Table 3, converting them to rates and then applying them to a Mexican population growing at 2% per year. In the second scenario we use the observed Border Patrol budget through 1985 but then freeze the budget at its 1986 level thereafter and use this series to predict probabilities of first departure and return that are converted to rates and applied to Mexico's growing population.
For simplicity we assume that migrants either depart the United States during the first 12 months after entry or never leave and that under both scenarios migrants experience no mortality (the actual survival rate for U.S. Hispanics from age 20 to 60 is 0.91 according the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics 2010). Figure 9 shows what would happen to the undocumented population of the United States under these two admittedly stylized scenarios. As can be seen, based on the observed budget of the Border Patrol the undocumented population is projected to expand from 3.1 million in 1986 to 14 million in 2010, whereas if the real value of the Border Patrol budget had remained at its 1986 level instead of accelerating exponentially the population would only have reached 9.7 million persons, some 31% lower. Taking the difference between actual Border Patrol budget and that assumed to be fixed at the 1986 level, we estimate that $53.3 million extra dollars were spent to create an undocumented population about a third greater than it would have been with no increase in spending.
Figure 9
Simulated size of undocumented population under two scenarios
Although the foregoing exercise is only a stylized simulation, it nonetheless suggests that if policy makers had done nothing---never increased the Border Patrol's funding beyond keeping pace with inflation---the undocumented population would likely have grown substantially less. The waste of this money is underscored by the fact that it was used in a futile effort to curtail a flow of undocumented migrants that was already destined to wind down after 2000 because of the demographic transition in Mexico. The decline of Mexican fertility down to levels roughly comparable to those in United States reduced the rate of labor force growth, increased the average age of those at risk of departure, transformed Mexico into an aging society, and ultimately brought an end to undocumented migration.
Aside from doing nothing, however, there were other policy options available to officials beyond attempting to suppress migration through police actions at the border. One such option would be to accept Mexican migration as natural component of ongoing economic integration under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Between NAFTA's implementation in 1994 and 2010, for example, total trade between Mexico and the United States rose 5.3 times while according to data from the Office of Immigration Statistics (2014) entries by business visitors increased 3.6 times, exchange visitors 6.2 times, tourists 12.1 times, intra-company transferees 17.4 times, and treaty investors more than a thousand times. Within an integrated economy, people inevitably will be moving.
As the experience of recent decades has shown, however, in practical terms it appears to be difficult if not impossible to integrate markets for goods, commodities, capital, services, and information while keeping labor markets separate (Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002). A more realistic option would have been to manage migration in ways that benefit both nations while protecting to the degree possible the rights and interests of both migrants and natives, much as the European Union did with the creation of its internal labor market (Fernandez-Kelly and Massey, 2008; Massey 2008, 2009). Ironically a more open border would likely have produced less permanent immigration and slower Mexican population growth in the United States by facilitating cross-border circulation. Indeed, the recent analysis of Massey, Durand, and Pren (2015) shows that documented migrants are now the ones circulating back and forth between the two nations, even as undocumented migrants remain trapped or ""caged in"" north of the border.
Rather than blocking the revealed preference of the typical Mexican to move back and forth temporarily for work in the United States, policies could have been implemented to encourage return migration, such as lowering the cost and risk of remitting U.S. earnings, paying tax refunds to returned migrants, making legal immigrants eligible for U.S. entitlements even if they return to Mexico, and cooperating with Mexican authorities to create attractive options for savings and investment south of the border. The billions of dollars wasted on counterproductive border enforcement would have been better spent on structural adjustment funds channeled to Mexico to improve its infrastructure for public health, education, transportation, communication, banking, and insurance to build a stronger, more productive, and more prosperous North America and eliminate the motivations for migration currently lying in ineffective markets for insurance, capital, and credit (Massey 2008).
Now is an opportune time to shift from a policy of immigration suppression to one of immigration management. Net undocumented migration has been at or below zero since 2008 and research Hanson and McIntosh (2009) suggests the demographic push from population growth that did so much to promote undocumented migration in the past will continue to diminish and likely won’t return. As just noted, migrants leaving Mexico today are increasingly circulating in legal status and undocumented migration has dropped toward zero. Official statistics reveal that border apprehensions fell by 61% between 2005 and 2010 and the undocumented population has not grown since 2008 while legal permanent immigration averaged 163,000 entries per year and temporary worker entries averaged 312,000 per year (U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics 2014).
Legal permanent immigration substantially exceeds quota limitations because of the massive shift of Mexican legal permanent residents toward U.S. citizenship in response to harsh legislation passed in 1996 and thereafter, which applied to all foreign nationals, not just those without documents (Massey and Pren 2012a). Whereas Mexican naturalizations averaged just 29,000 per year between 1985 and 1995, since 1996 the average has been 123,000, producing 1.7 million more citizens than would otherwise have been created, all of whom acquired the right to sponsor the immediate entry of spouses, minor children, and parents without numerical limitation (U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics 2014). Over the same period, Congress quietly and with little notice increased the number of temporary work visas to levels not seen since the 1950s, causing the number of temporary worker entries to rise from 27,000 in 1995 to 361,000 in 2008. With the border presently ""under control"" and legal entries running at high levels, the only real element of immigration reform left is the legalization of the 11 million undocumented residents of the United States, who constitute 60% of all Mexican immigrants currently present in the United States (Castañeda and Massey 2102).
The principal reason offered to oppose such a legalization is that it would encourage additional undocumented migration, but work by Orrenius and Zavody (2003) found no significant influence of IRCA's legalization on subsequent flows, which simply returned to trend in a few years; and now, of course, the trend is zero net migration. Indeed, a close inspection of the coefficients in Table 3 suggests that the boom in Mexican migration is likely over. In the United States, the principal structural driver of both new and repeat migration---employment growth in the United States---remains modest, whereas in Mexico population growth has slowed dramatically, the economy is growing, the population is aging, education levels have risen, a sizeable middle class has emerged, and people are increasingly living in large metropolitan areas. All of these trends predict much lower levels of migration in the future, and if our analysis here is correct, granting legal status to undocumented migrants already present in the United States would probably increase their rate of return migration. More border enforcement and a denial of social and economic rights to those currently out of status, makes absolutely no sense in practical or moral terms.

Rogers Expresses Concern for Reduced Border Security & Enforcement of Immigration Laws
MAR 01 2016
Today, U.S. Rep. Harold ""Hal"" Rogers (KY-05) questioned U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske about the agency's request for an increase of $687 million in federal funding for the next fiscal year. Rogers applauded CBP for improved security efforts for people traveling with visas, but expressed concern for reduced border security and enforcement of immigration laws.
""The President’s unilateral action on immigration demonstrates he has no intention of working with Congress or respecting our Constitutional authority,"" said Rogers. ""Unfortunately, you and your agency are caught in the middle of this fight, and it has made passing an annual appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security incredibly difficult. It also makes it impossible to move forward on any meaningful immigration reforms while the President remains in office.""
Recently, there has been an unprecedented spike in unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S. southern border. In the first four months of fiscal year 2016, the U.S. Border Patrol has apprehended 20,000 unaccompanied alien children.
""That’s double the number that were apprehend in the same timeframe last year,"" stated Rogers. ""Unfortunately, this humanitarian crisis does not appear to be subsiding anytime soon and this committee will continue to work with you to provide CPB the resources that are needed to manage the situation.""
Many of those families and children are fleeing their countries due to a surge in drug cartel and gang violence across Central and South America. Rogers raised additional concern for the proposed reduction of 300 Border Patrol Agents at a time when drug cartels from Mexico and elsewhere are flooding urban and rural communities in America with heroin. 
""Others in the Administration have rightfully labeled the abuse of opioids as a national epidemic, with roughly 100 Americans losing their battle to addiction every day – and yet you have proposed to reduce our first line of defense against the entry of these dangerous, deadly drugs without the benefit of any supporting analysis that Border Patrol’s mission won’t be compromised,"" said Rogers.

Written testimony of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Executive Associate Director Thomas Homan for a Senate Committee on the Judiciary hearing titled “The Unaccompanied Children Crisis: Does the Administration Have a Plan to Stop the Border Surge and Adequately Monitor the Children?”
Release Date: February 23, 2016
226 Dirksen Senate Office Building
Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Leahy, and distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) role in addressing issues related to unaccompanied children (UC) arriving in the United States.
As you know, in 2014, an unprecedented sharp increase of families and unaccompanied children from Central America arrived to the United States. Among the reasons for this increase are both push and pull factors (e.g., violence in Central America, misperception about U.S. immigration policy that led people to believe they would be able to remain in the United States, lack of employment opportunities, and the desire to be with family members who are already present in the United States). Through the Administration’s whole-of-government approach, we continue to address this issue in a manner that is comprehensive, coordinated, and humane.
ICE is one of several Federal agencies involved in handling the cases of UC who arrive in the United States. ICE plays a critical role by quickly and safely transporting UC from U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody to the custody of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and effectuating removal orders as appropriate, following the conclusion of immigration proceedings.
Background
Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), an unaccompanied child who is a national or habitual resident of Canada or Mexico and who is apprehended at the border may be permitted to withdraw an application for admission and be returned to his or her country of origin if there are no human trafficking indicators or claims of fear of return, and the child is able to make an independent decision to withdraw the application. UC who are nationals or habitual residents of contiguous countries who are not eligible to be voluntarily repatriated are required to be placed in removal proceedings before an immigration court if DHS is seeking to remove them. Consistent with the TVPRA, a UC from a non-contiguous country who is encountered at the border is generally issued a Notice to Appear and placed in removal proceedings before an immigration judge in the U.S. Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). Like all individuals, UC are afforded an opportunity to claim asylum, humanitarian relief, or other immigration relief under our laws. As a matter of policy, ICE personnel must screen any UC encountered by ICE for potential trafficking indicators, regardless of citizenship or nationality. In cases of potential victimization, ICE coordinates with investigative authorities and victim assistance resources for follow-up. The vast majority of children encountered in the Rio Grande Valley during the 2014 influx came from the non-contiguous countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
Transfer of Unaccompanied Children
Absent exceptional circumstances, once a determination is made that the child is an unaccompanied child, DHS – including ICE – is required by law to transfer the child to ORR within 72 hours for care. During the limited time UC are held with ICE, pending transfer to ORR, they are separated from adult detainees for their safety and are provided with regular access to snacks, milk, juice, consular officials, telephones, and other resources.
All 24 ICE ERO field offices have primary and back-up Field Office Juvenile Coordinators (FOJCs), each of whom receive annual, specialized training with respect to the unique vulnerabilities of children. These FOJCs serve as local subject-matter experts on the proper processing, transportation, referral and transfer of UC to ORR custody; monitor operational practices for compliance with regulations, standards, and policy; and are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Once HHS notifies ICE that a shelter bed is available, it is ICE’s responsibility to quickly and safely transport the unaccompanied child to ORR. ICE transports UC via ground, commercial air, and ICE charter flights. In order to avoid the potential strain that UC transfers can place on ICE Enforcement and Removal (ERO) resources at times, such as that which occurred during the 2014 influx, ICE has implemented a contract for such transfers, which has alleviated the need for ERO personnel to effectuate such transportation duties and freed up ERO officers to continue to perform other law enforcement responsibilities. Further, the President’s 2017 Budget includes base funding to effectuate the transfer of up to 75,000 UC, with additional contingency funding available should UC transfers exceed prior year levels.
Human Smuggling
ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is the primary investigative arm within DHS and is responsible for the investigation of human smuggling. From October 2013 until the present, ICE has initiated over 4,100 investigations and has arrested approximately 6,900 individuals for human smuggling related violations. ICE utilizes an interagency and multi-disciplinary approach to combat human smuggling. ICE supports and expands designated operations and investigations to identify those significant organizations, pathways, and trends that highlight key vulnerabilities within the human smuggling cycle that can be exploited by the United States Government. DHS, ICE, and HSI are actively engaged in investigations to identify organizations responsible for smuggling these children from their respective countries into the United States.
Removal of Unaccompanied Children
For UC with final orders of removal issued by EOIR, ICE takes appropriate enforcement action based on DHS’s immigration enforcement priorities. Under the TVPRA, ICE must ensure that each removal is fully coordinated with host government authorities. Coordination with foreign officials includes: providing the unaccompanied child an opportunity to communicate with a consular official prior to departure, repatriating at a designated port of entry, and ensuring that a receiving government official or designee signs for custody to record the transfer, in addition to other requirements specific to each country, such as certain hours during which repatriations can be conducted. The majority of UC repatriations conducted by ICE occur via commercial air or charter flight, and, during transport, children must be accompanied by appropriate personnel.
Between fiscal year (FY) 2012 and FY 2015, ICE removed 7,643 UC from the United States including 1,813 to Honduras, 2,517 to Guatemala, 2,485 to Mexico, and 663 to El Salvador.1

1 Removal counts are based on designation of UC at time of initial book-in and individual subjects may no longer be under the age of 18 at the time of removal.
 Steps to Address the Issue
As you are aware, DHS has taken a number of important steps to deter illegal immigration. Secretary Johnson has made clear that recent border entrants and those apprehended attempting to cross the border unlawfully are top enforcement priorities as indicated in the November 2014 enforcement priorities memorandum. Consistent with our laws and values, recent border crossers, including those apprehended as unaccompanied children, who are unable to establish they are eligible for relief and exhausted appeals have been, and will continue to be, ICE removal priorities.
Secretary Johnson, Director Saldaña, and I have also personally met with high level officials from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to secure their cooperation in stemming the illegal flow of their citizens into the United States. These partnerships have also resulted in enhanced cooperation between ICE and law enforcement partners in Central America and Mexico to combat and prosecute human trafficking and smuggling organization networks illegally smuggling hundreds of individuals – including children and families – throughout Central America and Mexico into the United States.
Conclusion
With the Committee’s support, we continue to work closely with our sister agencies to address the care and processing of UC arriving in the United States consistent with the requirements of controlling law, and to prioritize threats to national security, public safety, and border security as we enforce our immigration laws.
Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today and for your continued support of ICE and its law enforcement mission. I look forward to answering any questions.

De Minimis Value Increases to $800
Release Date Fri, 03/11/2016
WASHINGTON — As agreed in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, signed by President Barack Obama Feb. 24, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced that March 10, it raised the value of a shipment of merchandise imported by one person on one day that generally may be imported free of duties and taxes from $200 to $800. This raising of the de minimis exemption is due to an amendment of the Tariff Act of 1930 included in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.
Shipments valued at $800 or less for the de minimis exemption will be eligible under the same processes and with the same restrictions that currently apply to de minimis shipments of $200 or less.
CBP plans to publish an Interim Final Rule amending the appropriate regulations and soliciting comments from interested parties. CBP has the right to require a formal entry on any shipment where additional information, bonding or protection is required.  In the case of low value shipments, it is important to note that this treatment can be denied if used for the purpose of avoiding compliance with any pertinent law or regulation. 
In fiscal year 2015, CBP processed more than $2.4 trillion in trade, processed approximately 33 million import (entries) and collected roughly $46 billion in duties, taxes and other fees – the largest amount collected in the last five years. 
For more information about CBP, click here: www.cbp.gov.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland Security charged with the management, control and protection of our nation's borders at and between the official ports of entry. CBP is charged with keeping terrorists and terrorist weapons out of the country while enforcing hundreds of U.S. laws.

Smart Borders
Entry/Exit System (EES)
Entry/Exit System (EES)
The Entry/Exit System (EES)
will be an automated IT system for registering travellers from third-countries, both short-stay visa holders and visa exempt travellers, each time they cross an EU external border. The system will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection.
It will also record refusals of entry. EES will replace the current system of manual stamping of passports, which is time consuming, does not provide reliable data on border crossings and does not allow a systematic detection of over-stayers (travellers who have exceeded the maximum duration of their authorised stay).
EES will contribute to prevent irregular migration and help protect the security of European citizens. The new system will also help bona fide third-country nationals to travel more easily while also identifying more efficiently over-stayers as well as cases of document and identity fraud. In addition to this, the system will enable to make a wider use of automated border control checks and self-service systems, which are quicker and more comfortable for the traveller.
The European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA) is responsible for developing and managing the system.
Background
EES is among the measures undertaken as part of the Security Union and will help achieve the objectives of the European Agenda on Security
and the European Agenda on Migration
in particular regarding border management and preventing cross-border crime and terrorism.
The European Commission presented the proposal for EES
on 6 April 2016 as part of the revised Smart Borders Package
. After negotiations with the European Parliament and the Council the co-legislators reached an agreement in July 2017. The EES Regulation, together with a targeted amendment of the Schengen Border Code, were adopted on 20 November 2017 and entered into force on 29 December 2017.

CBP's Eyes in the Sky
CBP’s tethered aerostats keep watch for trouble from 10,000 feet
Article by Dave Long, videos by Dan Barrios
Frontline Aerostats Video 1

 Eyes in the sky stretch over the southern U.S. border at 10,000 feet, from Yuma, Arizona, to Lajas, Puerto Rico. Eight special blimps that are part of the Tethered Aerostat Radar System, or TARS, watch over the southern U.S. border. Each balloon is moored to the ground with a special nylon fiber cable, and raised and lowered with a powered winch. Swaying silently in the breeze, U.S. Customs and Border Protection aerostats are unmanned, unarmed, and spend their service lives hovering over a fixed location on the southern edge of the border.   
“TARS is the most cost-efficient capability that we own,” according to Richard Booth, director of domain operations and integration for CBP’s Office of Air and Marine. “TARS is like a low-flying satellite system, but cheaper to launch and operate,” Booth explained.
“The aerostats are aerodynamic balloons and fly like kites in the wind—no one pilots them,” said Rob Brown, CBP program manager for TARS. ""Raising radar and other sensors to high altitude boosts surveillance range, and the physical sight of an aerostat is a visual deterrent to illegal activity in the air and on the ground,"" explained Brown. Each TARS balloon contains a radar weighing about 2,200 pounds, capable of detecting aircraft at a range of 200 miles.

Each sweep of the radar in the belly of a TARS detects all flying aircraft within the balloon's 200-mile range. Wireless transmitters send TARS radar data from each balloon into the Internet cloud, where it is combined with other TARS radar data, according to Brown. Radar data is downloaded from the cloud at the Air and Marine Operations Center, AMOC, in Riverside, California. Using the Air and Marine Operations Surveillance System, the AMOC can integrate more than 700 sensor feeds to simultaneously track 50,000 aircraft in flight over the U.S., Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America.
The CBP aerostat program began over 30 years ago when the U.S. Customs Service started using tethered aerostats to counter the rising number of low-flying small aircraft operated by drug smugglers. For years, traffickers moved contraband into the U.S. by air because it was cheap and efficient. Customs authorities estimated that by the early 1980s, as many as 8,500 illegal flights per year were transporting narcotics directly from the Caribbean, Central or South America into the U.S. “The shortest route from the narcotics production areas to U.S. markets is by air,” said Booth.

To circumvent ground-based radar, drug smugglers in low-flying aircraft can hide behind terrain features, such as mountains and valleys. Radar installed in an aerostat, however, detects all aircraft within range, including small planes flying low and slow over the border.
In 1978 the U.S. Air Force set up the first TARS site in Cudjoe Key, Florida. A second TARS went into service in 1983 at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. From 1988 to 1991, the U.S. Customs Service established more TARS sites at Yuma, Arizona, and three sites in Texas, including Marfa, Eagle Pass and Rio Grande City.  By the end of 1994, additional TARS balloons were floating in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and even the Bahamas. The U.S. Air Force managed the TARS program until July 2013, when the program was transferred to CBP.

As each new aerostat went into service, smugglers would relocate flight routes to other areas still undefended by aerostats. However, the impact of the first aerostats was clear, yielding a bonanza of interdictions, arrests and aircraft seizures. Due to the efficiency of TARS and OAM enforcement, the number of unidentified aircraft flying over the border has dwindled from 8,500 to less than 10 per year.   
Knowing the high likelihood of apprehension if flying across the U.S. border, smugglers now stop short of the border and try to move contraband over land into the U.S. ""TARS has enabled CBP to control the air threat, but not eliminate it. The rising number of landings short of the border indicates that smugglers view air as a viable means of transport and are positioned to take advantage if given a chance. We call them 'shortlanders',"" explained Booth.
In June 2014, TARS detected an unknown aircraft flying without a transponder signal, near Hermosillo, Mexico. The AMOC used TARS located along the southwest border to follow the plane, heading northwest towards the U.S. border. With the assistance of Mexican liaison officers assigned to the AMOC, CBP notified Mexican officials, who launched two Mexican Air Force patrol planes to investigate the unidentified aircraft. AMOC controllers tracked the mystery plane to a location east of Ensenada, Mexico, where it faded from TARS radar.
AMOC reacquired the aircraft with no transponder signal rising into the air from where it had faded from radar. Mexican Air Force planes tracked three trucks departing the area where the mystery plane had landed and a Mexican military helicopter was launched to investigate. Three abandoned trucks were later found, resulting in the seizure of the vehicles and 200 packages of marijuana weighing a total of 2,043.9 kilograms. ""Because of TARS, most air smugglers now land well short of the border and run their loads into the U.S. from the ground,"" explained Rob Brown.
TARS is the only persistent wide-area air, maritime and land surveillance system specifically designed for CBP's border security mission. Despite their effectiveness, unmanned aircraft systems are not designed for the same mission. ""We cannot have enough UAS's carrying enough radar to duplicate the persistent ability of TARS to detect low-flying aircraft for 200 miles,"" explained Brown.
In 2013, TARS was responsible for detecting 586 suspicious flights, representing 42 percent of all the suspect flights along the Southwest border tracked by AMOC that year. Traffickers continue to innovate, however, currently increasing the use of ultralight aircraft to fly drugs over the border.

Early in 2014, the AMOC detected an aircraft flying south of Nogales in Sonora, Mexico, heading north toward the U.S. border. The plane crossed into the U.S. over Nogales, Arizona, still heading north at low level. The Border Patrol confirmed the target as an ultralight that went on to make an airdrop north of Nogales. Again through TARS radar, AMOC picked up the plane flying south and tracked it until it disappeared from radar in Mexico. Border Patrol agents seized seven bundles of marijuana weighing 159.75 pounds and an abandoned all-terrain vehicle.
Later in 2014, the AMOC used TARS to spot another ultralight circling north of Caborca, Mexico. The AMOC tracked the target as it flew toward the U.S. border. Two CBP aircraft were directed toward the ultralight's expected border crossing point. The target crossed the U.S. border and continued northeast. CBP flight personnel visually confirmed the target was an ultralight. The AMOC contacted Border Patrol agents at Casa Grande, Arizona, to respond. The AMOC tracked the plane to a point near Eloy, Arizona, where an airdrop was observed. Border Patrol agents on the ground arrested three people and seized 10 packages of marijuana weighing a total of 230 pounds. Controllers at AMOC used TARS to watch the ultralight disappear back over the Mexican border. 
The TARS have been located to overlap slightly from one area of coverage to another, like merging circles on a Venn diagram, to ensure unbroken coverage on the southern border.
TARS contributes directly to CBP's international border security partnership with Mexico.  All air routes, clandestine air fields and support infrastructure identified by TARS and the AMOC are provided to Mexico for investigation, increasing U.S. intelligence and ability to disrupt transnational criminals on the border.
TARS also enables major international data sharing and joint law enforcement operations because of its extended southern radar range.  Most air threats originate south of the U.S. border—TARS enables CBP to coordinate joint law enforcement efforts with the government of Mexico.

Though TARS is economical to operate, the balloons have a limited service life. According to Rob Brown, ""every five to six years we are replacing the balloons due to wear and tear, being exposed to ultraviolet radiation, constant sunlight, getting beat up in the wind with sand blowing into them. They are carrying a 1-ton radar, so you can expect a fair amount of wear and tear,"" Brown said. Each TARS fully-outfitted aerostat costs the U.S. government $8.9 million. 
Aerostats are held in the air by helium. As aerostats gain altitude, the helium expands until it fills most of the aerostat. As aerostats are lowered, blowers pump air into the balloon to help maintain its shape and aerodynamics. The air pressure inside an aerostat is low, allowing it to survive small holes or tears in the fabric. Aerostats are raised and lowered by high-strength cables—the nylon cables used to moor a TARS aerostat can handle 35,000 pounds of tension. TARS sites are classified as restricted flying areas by the Federal Aviation Administration. Like other aircraft, all aerostats are equipped with anti-collision lights.
TARS radar is powered by a diesel generator that also powers the equipment that keeps the aerostat level in the air. The system contains enough fuel for four days of operation.  Altogether, the total of the radar, generator, navigation equipment, electronics and fuel amounts to nearly 5,000 pounds.

CBP is also testing the potential of a family of smaller, tactical aerostats for other roles in border security. Tactical aerostats have been transferred to CBP from the Department of Defense following use by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The aerostats include three models: the Persistent Threat Detection System; the Persistent Ground Surveillance System, and the smallest, the Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment system. The smaller aerostats operate at altitudes from 500 to 5,000 feet and monitor ground activity with radars, infrared and electro-optical cameras.
The tactical aerostats are similar in design to TARS, but differ in several aspects.  Each model can be relocated with portable mooring platforms and towers. All of the smaller balloons are equipped with a radio repeater to retransmit signals from high altitude. This has the effect of instantly boosting communications range for agents on the ground patrolling in flat, poor-reception areas. In addition to radar surveillance equipment, the smaller balloons host infrared and high-resolution cameras that deliver immediate real-time imagery to Border Patrol agents on the ground. 
""Tactical aerostats are proving very effective in southwest Texas,"" said Rob Brown. ""Recently a Border Patrol agent was using a tactical aerostat camera to watch a pickup truck driving up and down a road several times. On its fifth pass, it stopped in the middle of the road and six people with bales ran out of the bushes, stuffed them in the back of the truck, and ran back into the bushes. The Border Patrol agent was watching all of this.  The vehicle sped off with Border Patrol in pursuit. The tactical aerostat extends the Border Patrol's eyes and ears with these sensor and surveillance systems operating at altitude,"" Brown explained.

If I am entering the U.S. with valid travel papers, can law enforcement officers stop and search me?
Generally, customs officers may stop people at the border to determine whether they are admissible to the United States, and they may search people’s belongings for contraband. This is true even if there is nothing suspicious about you or your luggage. The government believes this authority to search without individualized suspicion extends to searches of electronic devices such as laptops and cell phones, but that is a contested legal issue. Officers may not select you for a personal search or secondary inspection based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

Can border officers ask questions about my immigration status?
Customs officers have the authority to ask your immigration status in order to determine whether you have the right to enter the country. If you are a U.S. citizen, you need only answer questions establishing your identity and citizenship, although refusing to answer routine questions about the nature and purpose of your travel could result in delay and/or further inspection. If you are a lawful permanent resident (LPR) who has maintained your status, you only have to answer questions establishing your identity and permanent residency. Refusal to answer other questions will likely cause delay, but officials may not deny you entry into the United States for failure to answer other questions. If you are a non-citizen visa holder or visitor, you may be denied entry into the United States if you refuse to answer officers’ questions. Officers may not select you for questioning based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs. If you are told you cannot enter the country and you fear you might be persecuted or tortured if you are sent back to the country from which you traveled, you should tell the customs officer about your fear and ask for asylum.

Can U.S. customs officers ask questions about my religious beliefs and practices or political opinions?
Religious and political beliefs and associations are protected by the First Amendment. Customs officers have sometimes asked travelers about their religious affiliation, religious practices, association with religious institutions, and political opinions. The travelers targeted for such questioning have often been Muslim. Questioning individuals about their religious and political beliefs, associations, and practices can infringe upon rights guaranteed by the Constitution and federal law — these rights are not surrendered at the border. If you are a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, you do not have to answer questions about your religious beliefs and practices or political opinions, and you cannot be denied entry to the United States for declining to answer such questions. If customs officers persist in asking you such questions, you can request to see a supervisor. If you are a non-citizen visa holder or visitor, you may decline to answer general questions about your religious beliefs and political opinions, but doing so may lead to delay or additional questioning, or possibly denial of your entry into the country. If you are told you cannot enter the country and you fear you might be persecuted or tortured if you are sent back to the country from which you traveled, you should tell the customs officer about your fear and ask for asylum.

If I am selected for a longer interview when I am coming into the United States, what can I do?
Your legal status in the country may inform what you decide to do if you are selected for longer questioning when entering the United States. U.S. citizens have the right to enter the United States, so if you are a U.S. citizen and the officers’ questions become intrusive, you can decline to answer those questions, but you should be aware that doing so may result in delay and/or further inspection. The same is true for lawful permanent residents: you generally cannot be denied entry to the United States, but declining to answer questions may result in delay or further inspection. Refusal by non-citizen visa holders and visitors to answer questions may result in denial of entry.
If the officers’ questions become intrusive or improper, you should complain and ask to speak to a supervisor. (This goes for citizens, lawful permanent residents, or non-citizen visa holders and visitors.) Although CBP takes the position that you are not entitled to an attorney during primary and secondary inspection, we encourage you to have the telephone number of an attorney or legal services organization with you and ask to contact them if you feel your rights are being violated or if you have been detained for an unusually long period. For anyone attempting to enter the United States, if a customs officer or border agent informs you that you are under arrest, or if it becomes clear that he or she suspects you have committed a crime, you should ask to speak to a lawyer before answering any further questions — and if you wish to exercise your right to remain silent, you should say so out loud.

Do I have to provide my laptop passwords or unlock my mobile phone for law enforcement officers at the border?
Customs officers have sometimes asked travelers to provide their laptop passwords or unlock their mobile phones when they are entering or leaving the United States. Your legal status in the country may inform what you decide to do if you’re asked for a password to unlock your device. U.S. citizens cannot be denied entry to the United States for refusing to provide passwords or unlocking devices. Refusal to do so might lead to delay, additional questioning, and/or officers seizing your device for further inspection. The same should be true for those who have previously been admitted to the U.S. as lawful permanent residents and have maintained their status — their green cards can’t be revoked without a hearing before an immigration judge. Visa holders and tourists from visa waiver countries, however, run the risk of being denied entry if they refuse to provide a password, and they should consider that risk before deciding how to proceed. If an officer searches and/or confiscates your laptop or cell phone, get a receipt for your property.

What types of law enforcement officers and other government officials could I encounter during the security screening process at the airport?
At airports, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers conduct security screenings.  Most TSA officers are not commissioned law enforcement officers, and their role is to conduct screening of passengers, baggage and cargo. TSA screeners can search you and your baggage at screening checkpoints, but they cannot arrest you. Other law enforcement officers, such as airport police, are present at airports.

Can my bags or I be searched after going through metal detectors with no problem or after security sees that my bags do not contain a weapon?
Yes. Even if the initial screening of your bags by TSA reveals nothing suspicious, the screeners have the authority to conduct a further search of you or your bags. Screeners may not select you for a personal search or secondary inspection based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

What if I wear a religious head covering and I am selected by airport security officials for additional screening?
You have the right to wear your religious head covering. You should assert your right to wear your religious head covering if asked to remove it before going through airport security screening. If an alarm goes off, however, airport security officers may request additional screening. They may then conduct a pat-down of your religious head covering or ask you to remove it. You have the right to request that the pat-down or removal be conducted by a person of your gender and that it occurs in a private area.
If you do not want the TSA officer to touch your religious head covering, you must refuse and say that you would prefer to pat down your own religious head covering. You will then be taken aside, and a TSA officer will supervise you as you pat down your religious head covering. After the pat-down, the TSA officer may rub your hands with a small cotton cloth and place it in a machine to test for chemical residue. If you pass this chemical residue test, you should be allowed to proceed to your flight. If the TSA officer insists on the removal of your religious head covering, you have a right to ask that it be done in a private area. Officers may not conduct additional screening based solely on your race, national origin, religion, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

What if I am traveling with breast milk or formula?
Parents and caregivers flying with and without children are permitted to bring breast milk and formula (and ice packs or other accessories required to cool the breast milk or formula) in quantities greater than three ounces, as long as you notify the officers about the items at the security checkpoint. When carrying breast milk or formula through the checkpoint, they will be inspected. TSA officials may test the liquids for explosives. TSA officials may ask you to open the containers during the screening process. Breast milk and formula, along with other liquids and gels, may also be packed in your luggage and checked with your airline.

If I am on an airplane, can an airline employee interrogate me or ask me to get off the plane?
An airline pilot may refuse to fly a passenger if s/he reasonably believes, based on observation, that the passenger is a threat to flight safety. A pilot may not, however, question you or refuse to allow you on a flight because of biased stereotypes, including any based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

(En Español)
As I have said repeatedly, our borders are not open to illegal migration; if you come here illegally, we will send you back consistent with our laws and values.
In the spring and summer of 2014 we faced a significant spike in families and unaccompanied children from Central America attempting to cross our southern border illegally. In response, we took a number of actions in collaboration with the governments of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, and the numbers declined dramatically. In Fiscal Year 2015, the number of apprehensions by U.S. Border Patrol of those attempting to cross our southern border illegally -- an indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally -- decreased to 331,333. With the exception of one year, this was the lowest number of apprehensions on our southern border since 1972. In recent months, however, the rate of apprehensions on our southern border has begun to climb again.
In November 2014, I issued new priorities for immigration enforcement as part of the President’s immigration accountability executive actions. These new Department-wide priorities focus our enforcement resources on convicted criminals and threats to public safety. These new enforcement priorities also focus on border security, namely the removal of those apprehended at the border or who came here illegally after January 1, 2014.
We must enforce the law in accordance with these priorities, and secure our borders.
Accordingly, the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with our domestic and international partners, is undertaking the following actions:
Removals
Since the summer of 2014 we have removed and repatriated migrants to Central America at an increased rate, averaging about 14 flights a week. Most of those returned have been single adults.
This past weekend, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) engaged in concerted, nationwide enforcement operations to take into custody and return at a greater rate adults who entered this country illegally with children. This should come as no surprise. I have said publicly for months that individuals who constitute enforcement priorities, including families and unaccompanied children, will be removed.  
The focus of this weekend’s operations were adults and their children who (i) were apprehended after May 1, 2014 crossing the southern border illegally, (ii) have been issued final orders of removal by an immigration court, and (iii) have exhausted appropriate legal remedies, and have no outstanding appeal or claim for asylum or other humanitarian relief under our laws. As part of these operations, 121 individuals were taken into custody, primarily from Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina, and they are now in the process of being repatriated. To effect removal, most families are first being transported to one of ICE’s family residential centers for temporary processing before being issued travel documents and boarding a return flight to their home countries.  
Given the sensitive nature of taking into custody and removing families with children, a number of precautions were taken as part of this weekend’s operations. ICE deployed from around the country a number of female agents and medical personnel to take part in the operations, and, in the course of the operations, ICE exercised prosecutorial discretion in a number of cases for health or other personal reasons.
This enforcement action was overseen by Sarah Saldaña, the Director of ICE, and supported and executed by Thomas Homan, a career law enforcement official who leads ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.
At my direction, additional enforcement operations such as these will continue to occur as appropriate.
Increasing border security
We are continuing to enhance our border security resources and capabilities, working closely with state and local counterparts. As a result of our long-term investment in border security over the past 15 years, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has greater capability to identify and interdict illegal crossings than at any time in our Nation’s history. This includes the largest deployment of vehicles, aircraft, boats, and equipment along the southwest border in the 90-year history of the Border Patrol.  And through the Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan we launched in early 2015, we are for the first time putting to use in a combined and strategic way the assets and personnel of CBP, ICE, Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Coast Guard to better protect the border.  
In response to the recent increases in migrant flows along the southwest border, CBP has deployed additional permanent Border Patrol Agents to high-traffic areas, augmented operations in South Texas with Mobile Response Teams, and redirected support from other Border Patrol sectors including through remote interviewing technology.  CBP has also increased surveillance capabilities by adding tethered aerostats (long-range radars) and other technology, along with additional aircraft. CBP will sustain these heightened border security efforts, along with the humanitarian aspects of its responsibilities, while the current migration levels persist.
Unaccompanied children
As the number of unaccompanied children crossing our southern border has risen again in recent months, DHS has continued our close coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as it increases its capacity to care for unaccompanied minors and place them with sponsors. Our goal is to ensure that CBP has the continued capability to quickly and efficiently transfer unaccompanied minors after they are apprehended to HHS custody, as is required by U.S. law. In the past month, HHS added over 1,000 beds for this purpose, and recently announced that another estimated 1,800 beds will be available soon. HHS is continuing to explore options for additional beds if necessary.
Cracking down on criminal smugglers
In the summer of 2014, the Deputy Attorney General and I announced “Operation Coyote” to crack down on those involved in the criminal smuggling of migrants from Central America and elsewhere. Since then, 1,022 smugglers and their associates have been arrested, and hundreds of bank accounts have been seized.
With the Department of Justice, we are now doubling down on these efforts. This will build on existing initiatives such as ICE’s Human Smuggling Cell, which is working with the financial industry to target and disrupt the flow of funds to human smuggling organizations. DHS’s recently formed Joint Task Forces, JTF-West and JTF-Investigations, will coordinate the deployment of additional DHS investigative and prosecutorial resources and their integration into the Department of Justice’s ongoing law enforcement and prosecution operations.
Cooperation with Mexico
We are expanding our cooperation with Mexico in dealing with illicit migration. In particular, we are working with our Mexican partners to enhance joint efforts on our shared border, to support Mexico’s efforts on its southern border, and to shut down the criminal groups and illegal support networks that exploit vulnerable migrants. DHS and the Department of State will also continue to support the Merida Initiative, the longstanding partnership between the United States and Mexico to fight organized crime and associated violence.    
Expanding the public messaging campaign
DHS and the Department of State are expanding our existing messaging campaign in Central America, Mexico, and the United States to educate those considering making the journey north, as well as their families abroad, about the dangerous realities of the journey. The messaging will also highlight the recent enforcement operations.
The Flores case
We continue to disagree with the District Court decision in the Flores case that a 1997 settlement of a case solely involving unaccompanied children now applies to children who arrive with a parent and their processing at today’s family residential centers. The decision, and the resulting injunction, significantly constrains our ability to respond to an increasing flow of illegal migration into the United States. We have appealed the decision, and the appellate court has agreed to hear the appeal on an expedited basis. Meanwhile, we have implemented significant reforms to how we operate our family residential centers to transition them to temporary processing facilities for these individuals, and have taken steps to ensure compliance with the District Court’s July 24 and August 21 orders.
Creating an alternative, safe and legal path
Finally, to effectively address this situation, we recognize that we must offer alternatives to those who are fleeing the poverty and violence in Central America. More border security and removals, by themselves, will not overcome the underlying conditions that currently exist in Central America. I am pleased that Congress, in the recently-enacted omnibus spending bill, included $750 million in aid for Central America.
In the meantime, DHS and the Department of State are accelerating the development of new mechanisms to process and screen Central American refugees in the region, about which we hope to make a more formal announcement soon. We will expand access to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program in the region and develop more legal alternatives to the dangerous and unlawful journey many are currently taking in the hands of human smugglers.
These new refugee processing mechanisms will build upon the existing Central American Minors Program, which is already providing an in-country refugee processing option for certain children with parents lawfully in the United States.  Thus far, we have received more than 6,000 applications for the Program, some children have begun to arrive in the United States as part of the Program, and we expect the pace of arrivals to increase steadily moving forward. We are also engaging other countries in the region, encouraging them to join us in broadening access to protection for refugees from Central America. 
*          *         *             *
I know there are many who loudly condemn our enforcement efforts as far too harsh, while there will be others who say these actions don’t go far enough. I also recognize the reality of the pain that deportations do in fact cause. But, we must enforce the law consistent with our priorities. At all times, we endeavor to do this consistent with American values, and basic principles of decency, fairness, and humanity.

Law enforcement asks about my immigration status
How to reduce risk to yourself
Stay calm. Don’t run, argue, resist, or obstruct the officer, even if you believe your rights are being violated. Keep your hands where police can see them.
Don’t lie about your status or provide false documents.
Your rights
You have the right to remain silent and do not have to discuss your immigration or citizenship status with police, immigration agents, or other officials. Anything you tell an officer can later be used against you in immigration court.
If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your immigration papers, you must show them if you have them with you.
If an immigration agent asks if they can search you, you have the right to say no. Agents do not have the right to search you or your belongings without your consent or probable cause.
If you’re over 18, carry your papers with you at all times. If you don’t have them, tell the officer that you want to remain silent, or that you want to consult a lawyer before answering any questions.
What to do in such an encounter
In some states, you must provide your name to law enforcement if you are stopped and told to identify yourself. But even if you give your name, you don’t have to answer other questions.
If you are driving and are pulled over, the officer can require you to show your license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance, but you don’t have to answer questions about your immigration status.
Customs officers can ask about your immigration status when entering or leaving the country. If you are a lawful permanent resident (LPR) who has maintained your status, you only have to answer questions establishing your identity and permanent residency. Refusal to answer other questions will likely cause delay, but officials may not deny you entry into the United States for failure to answer other questions. If you are a non-citizen visa holder, you may be denied entry into the U.S. if you refuse to answer officers’ questions.

I’ve been stopped by police or ICE
How to reduce risk to yourself
Stay calm and do not resist or obstruct the agents or officers.
Do not lie or give false documents.
Prepare yourself and your family in case you are arrested. Memorize the phone numbers of your family and your lawyer. Make emergency plans if you have children or take medication.
Your rights
You have the right to remain silent. If you wish to exercise that right, say so out loud. (In some states, you may be required to provide your name if asked to identify yourself.)
You do not have to consent to a search of yourself or your belongings, but police may pat down your clothing if they suspect a weapon.
If you are arrested by police, you have the right to a government-appointed lawyer.
If you are detained by ICE, you have the right to consult with a lawyer, but the government is not required to provide one for you. You can ask for a list of free or low-cost alternatives.
You do not have to answer questions about where you were born, whether you are a U.S. citizen, or how you entered the country. (Separate rules apply at international borders and airports, and for individuals on certain nonimmigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers.)
What to do if you are arrested or detained
Say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately. Don’t give any explanations or excuses. Don’t say anything, sign anything, or make any decisions without a lawyer.
If you have been arrested by police, you have the right to make a local phone call. The police cannot listen if you call a lawyer.
If you have been detained by ICE, you have the right to contact your consulate or have an officer inform the consulate of your detention.
Remember your immigration number (“A” number) and give it to your family. It will help family members locate you.
Keep a copy of your immigration documents with someone you trust.
If you are a non-citizen: Ask your lawyer about the effect of a criminal conviction or plea on your immigration status. Don’t discuss your immigration status with anyone but your lawyer. While you are in jail, an immigration agent may visit you. Do not answer questions or sign anything before talking to a lawyer. Read all papers fully. If you do not understand or cannot read the papers, tell the officer you need an interpreter.
If you believe your rights were violated
Write down everything you remember, including officers’ badges and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information for witnesses.
If you’re injured, seek medical attention immediately and take photographs of your injuries.
File a written complaint with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board. In most cases, you can file a complaint anonymously if you wish.

Police or ICE are at my home
How to reduce risk to yourself
Stay calm and keep the door closed. Opening the door does not give them permission to come inside, but it is safer to speak to ICE through the door.
Your rights
You have the right to remain silent, even if officer has a warrant.
You do not have to let police or immigration agents into your home unless they have certain kinds of warrants.
If police have an arrest warrant, they are legally allowed to enter the home of the person on the warrant if they believe that person is inside. But a warrant of removal/deportation (Form I-205) does not allow officers to enter a home without consent.
What to do when the police or ICE arrive  
Ask if they are immigration agents and what they are there for.
Ask the agent or officer to show you a badge or identification through the window or peephole.
Ask if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If they say they do, ask them to slide it under the door or hold it up to a window so you can inspect it.
Don’t lie or produce any false documents. Don’t sign anything without speaking with a lawyer first.
Do not open your door unless ICE shows you a judicial search or arrest warrant naming a person in your residence and/or areas to be searched at your address. If they don’t produce a warrant, keep the door closed. State: “I do not consent to your entry.”
If agents force their way in, do not resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: “I do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.”
If you are on probation with a search condition, law enforcement is allowed to enter your home.

I’ve been detained near the border by Border Patrol
How to reduce risk to yourself
Stay calm when interacting with immigration officials. Do not lie or provide false documents.
Never flee from an immigration checkpoint.
Your rights
You have the right to remain silent. You can also tell the agent that you’ll only answer questions in the presence of an attorney, no matter your citizenship or immigration status.
You do not have to answer questions about your immigration status. A limited exception exists for people who have permission to be in the U.S. for a specific reason and for a limited amount of time (a “nonimmigrant” on a visa, for example). These individuals are required to provide information about their immigration status if asked.
Generally, a Border Patrol agent cannot detain you unless they have “reasonable suspicion”  that you are committing or committed a violation of immigration law or federal law.
An immigration officer cannot arrest you without “probable cause.” That means the agent must have facts about you that make it probable that you are committing, or committed, a violation of immigration law or federal law.
At immigration checkpoints, agents do not need any suspicion to stop you and ask you questions, but their questions should be brief and related to verifying immigration status. They can also visually inspect your vehicle.
What to expect
People who have entered the U.S. without inspection by an immigration official may be subject to expedited removal from the U.S. based on certain criteria. If you are told that you are subject to expedited removal, ask for the stated reason. Also, if you fear persecution if returned to your country of origin, you should immediately inform the agents of your fear.
At border crossings, federal authorities do not need a warrant or even suspicion of wrongdoing to justify conducting what courts have called a “routine search,” such as searching luggage or a vehicle.
If an agent asks you for documents, what you need to provide differs depending on your immigration status. U.S. citizens do not have to carry proof of citizenship if they are in the U.S. If you have valid immigration documents and are over the age of 18, the law requires that you to carry those documents with you. If you are asked by an immigration agent to produce them, show them to the agent. If you are an immigrant without documents, you can decline the officer’s request, although an agent may then ask you more questions.

I was stopped by police, ICE, or Border Patrol while in transit
How to reduce risk to yourself
Stay calm. Don’t run, argue, or obstruct the officer or agent. Keep your hands raised where they can see them.
If you are in a car, pull over in a safe place as quickly as possible. Turn off the engine, turn on the internal light, open the window part way and place your hands on the wheel. Upon request, show police your driver’s license, registration, and proof of insurance.
If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your papers, you must show them if you have them with you. If you are over 18, carry your immigration documents with you at all times. If you do not have immigration papers, say you want to remain silent.
Your rights

In a car:
Drivers and passengers have the right to remain silent. If you are a passenger, you can ask if you are free to leave. If the officer says yes, calmly leave.
If an officer or immigration agent asks to look inside your car, you can refuse to consent to the search. But if police generally believe that your car contains evidence of a crime, your car can be searched without your consent.
In addition to police, Border Patrol conduct “roving patrols” around the interior of the U.S., pulling over motorists. Border Patrol must have reasonable suspicion that the driver or passengers in the car committed an immigration violation or a federal crime.
Any arrest or prolonged stop by Border Patrol requires probable cause. You may ask the agents about the basis for probable cause, and they should tell you. In this situation, both the driver and any passengers have the right to remain silent and not answer questions about their immigration status.
On an airplane:
A pilot may refuse to fly a passenger if he or she reasonably believes that the passenger is a threat to flight safety. A pilot may not, however, question you or refuse to allow you on a flight because of bias based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity, or political beliefs.
If you believe you are mistakenly on a “no-fly” list, you should review our guidance on No-Fly lists here.
On buses and trains:
Border Patrol agents may board buses and trains in the 100-mile border region either at the station or while the bus is on its journey. More than one officer usually boards the bus, and they will ask passengers questions about their immigration status, ask passengers to show them immigration documents, or both.
These questions should be brief and related to verifying one’s lawful presence in the U.S. You are not required to answer and can simply say you do not wish to do so. As always, you have the right to remain silent.
If you believe your rights were violated
Write down everything you remember, including officers’ badges and patrol car numbers, which agency the officers were from, and any other details. Get contact information from witnesses.
If you’re injured, seek medical attention immediately and take photographs of your injuries.
File a written complaint with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board. In most cases, you can file a complaint anonymously.

I am detained while my immigration case is underway
Your rights
Most people who are detained while their case is underway are eligible to be released on bond or with other reporting conditions.
You have the right to call a lawyer or your family if you are detained, and you have the right to be visited by a lawyer in detention.
You have the right to have your attorney with you at any hearing before an immigration judge.
What to do if you are detained
If you are denied release after being arrested for an immigration violation, ask for a bond hearing before an immigration judge. In many cases, an immigration judge can order that you be released or that your bond be lowered.

I've been arrested and need to challenge a deportation order
Your rights
You have the right to a hearing to challenge a deportation order, unless you waive your right to a hearing, sign something called a “Stipulated Removal Order,” or take “voluntary departure.”
You have the right to an attorney, but the government does not have to provide one for you. Ask for a list of free or low-cost alternatives. If you have no lawyer, ask the court to allow you time to find one.
What to do if you are arrested
If you are told that you do not have the right to see an immigration judge, you should speak with a lawyer immediately. There are some cases in which a person might not have a right to see an immigration judge. But even if you are told that is your situation, you should ask to speak to a lawyer immediately because Immigration officers will not always know or tell you about exceptions might apply to you.
If you fear persecution or torture in your home country, tell an officer and contact a lawyer immediately. You have additional rights if you have this fear.

NOVEMBER 5, 2015NEW YORK, NYCONTRABAND
ICE HSI's Border Enforcement Security Task Force disrupts a scheme to ship stolen luxury cars overseas
7 charged with conspiring to export the cars to various countries in West Africa
NEW YORK – Seven people were charged by criminal complaint in federal court Wednesday with conspiracy to export and transport stolen cars. The defendants allegedly oversaw the loading of stolen cars into shipping containers bound for West Africa.  
The arrests follow a 19-month investigation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), New York Police Department’s Organized Crime Control Bureau (OCCB) and Auto Crime Division; U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the National Insurance Crime Bureau and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.
As a result of this investigation, HSI’s Border Enforcement Task Force (BEST), seized 249 stolen luxury cars worth more than $16 million. The high end cars include models from BMW, Mercedes Benz, and Range Rover.
According to court documents, Adama Kamara, Boubakar Sacko, Dambelly Sarjo, Lamin Saho, Mamadou Habib Diallo, Ousmane Tounkara, Oluwasoji Osho knew the cars were stolen, loaded them into shipping containers and moved the cars to a seaport for transportation to West Africa.
Individuals working for the scheme would rent luxury cars from various national car rental companies, sometimes using false identification.  The renters drove the cars to a prearranged location for temporary storage. Other members of the scheme would then pick the cars up and drive them to a second location where the defendants oversaw and participated in the loading of the luxury cars into shipping containers.  Shipping documents filed with CBP revealed the luxury cars were scheduled to be loaded onto cargo ships destined for ports in West Africa. 
“The Border Enforcement Security Task Force dismantled this criminal organization which victimizes industry and the U.S. economy by exploiting commerce and defrauding the U.S. government,” said Glenn Sorge, acting special agent in charge HSI New York.  “This massive scheme was led by few but involved many.  By arresting the facilitators and leaders of this organization, we have sent a clear message that HSI and its partners are vigilant and relentless in the pursuit of crippling organized criminal activity.”
“This investigation prevented more than 200 stolen luxury vehicles from being smuggled overseas,” said NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton. “I commend the efforts of the investigators and prosecutors involved in this investigation whose hard work held these individuals accountable for their criminal conduct.”
“CBP, working in partnership with Homeland Security Investigations and the New York Police Department, demonstrated vigilance and exceptional skill in the targeting, detection, examination and seizure of these stolen vehicles directly leading to the apprehension and prosecution of the conspirators,” said Mr. Robert E. Perez, director field operations New York.
The BEST is a multi-agency task force comprised of special agents, NYPD detectives and CBP officers to focus on disrupting border related criminal activity associated with narcotics smuggling; human trafficking and smuggling; money laundering; bulk cash smuggling; weapons trafficking and smuggling and other serious crimes.
The defendants were arraigned Wednesday in the Southern District of New York before United States Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein.  The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Home News Testimony Written testimony of CBP Commissioner for a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing titled “America’s Heroin Epidemic at the Border: Local, State, and Federal Law Enforcement Efforts to Combat Illicit Narcotic Trafficking”
Written testimony of CBP Commissioner R.Gil Kerlikowske for a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing titled “America’s Heroin Epidemic at the Border: Local, State, and Federal Law Enforcement Efforts to Combat Illicit Narcotic Trafficking”
Release Date: November 23, 2015
Phoenix, Arizona
Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear today in Arizona to discuss the role of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in combating the flow of dangerous drugs into the United States.
The use and availability of heroin and other illegal opioids, as well as the nonmedical use of prescription opioids in the United States, have been increasing at an alarming rate. The situation is one of the most important, complex, and difficult challenges our Nation faces today. According to a recent report1 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, overdose deaths involving heroin nearly doubled between 2011 and 2013 and are climbing.
There is no single entity, nor a single solution, that can address this problem. Tackling this complex threat involves a united, comprehensive strategy and aggressive approach by multiple entities – from law enforcement, science, medicine, education, social work, and the public health sector – across all levels of government. While continued efforts to interdict heroin and other drugs at the border are a key aspect of addressing this crisis, interdictions, arrests and convictions alone cannot mitigate the far-reaching effects of nonmedical prescription opioid and heroin abuse. We need to focus on prevention and treatment, and identify the characteristics of developing cases of opioid use disorder before they escalate. We must also concentrate on deterring opioid trafficking by transnational criminal organizations (TCO), cartels, and other distribution networks.
To do this effectively, we must better integrate our efforts, share information, and partner with federal, state, local and tribal communities as well as the private sector. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Heroin Response Strategy,2 recently announced by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), will foster a collaborative partnership between public health and law enforcement entities. The strategy seeks a comprehensive response to this complex epidemic by addressing the broad range of efforts required – on the international, national, and local levels – to reduce the use, distribution, and trafficking of this dangerous substance.
As America’s unified border agency, CBP has a critical role in the efforts to keep dangerous drugs like heroin and other opioids out of the hands of the American public. Combating TCOs and drug trafficking organizations (DTO) is a key component of our multi-layered, risk-based approach to enhance the security of our borders. This layered approach to security reduces our reliance on any single point or program, and extends our zone of security outward, ensuring that our physical border is not the first or last line of defense, but one of many.
Secretary Johnson’s Unity of Effort initiative has put in place new and strengthened management processes to enable more effective DHS component operations to address TCOs, drug-trafficking, and other cross-border threats. In addition, DHS-wide border and maritime security activities are guided by the new Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan and complement the Administration’s National Drug Control Strategy, and the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy. Aimed at leveraging the range of unique Department roles, responsibilities, and capabilities, the Campaign enhances our ability to work together in a more unified way to address these comprehensive threats. In support of this new Campaign, on November 20, 2014, the Secretary announced the creation of three new joint task forces (JTF) to coordinate the efforts of the combined resources of DHS component agencies. Joint Task Force-East is responsible for the maritime approaches to the United States across the southeast, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Caribbean. Joint Task Force-West is responsible for the southwest land border from Texas to California. And, supporting the work of the other two task forces is a standing Joint Task Force for Investigations. These three JTFs reached full operational capability on July 30 of this year.

 Interdictions and Trends
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, CBP officers and agents seized 3.8 million pounds of drugs across the country. During FY 2015, CBP saw a four- percent increase from FY 2014 in overall nationwide seizure events, but a six- percent decrease in drug seizures by weight. Additionally, heroin total seizure amounts for FY 2015 increased 23 percent to more than 6,000 pounds. CBP seizures of clandestinely made opioids like fentanyl, while relatively small compared to heroin, have also significantly increased from 1.1 kg in FY 2013 to 3.7 kg seized in FY 2014 and 89.7 kg seized in FY 2015. These figures demonstrate the continued effectiveness of CBP’s detection and interdiction abilities, but may also indicate that manufacturers and traffickers are increasing the production and supply of heroin in the United States.
Mexican manufacturers and traffickers continue to be major suppliers of heroin to the United States. Although the vast majority of CBP’s heroin interdictions are seized from DTO smuggling networks along the Southwest land border, CBP also interdicts this dangerous drug in all environments and transportation modes. The reach and influence of Mexican cartels, notably Los Zetas, and the Gulf, Juarez, Jalisco New Generation, and Sinaloa Cartels, stretches across and beyond the Southwest border, operating through loose business ties with smaller organizations in cities across the United States. The threat of DTOs is dynamic; rival organizations are constantly vying for control, and as U.S. and Mexican anti-drug efforts disrupt criminal networks, new groups arise and form new alliances.
DHS Resources and Capabilities to Counter Drug Trafficking Organizations
CBP, responsible for America’s frontline border security, has a significant role in the Nation’s efforts to combat the cross-border criminal activity of cartels and other drug trafficking organizations. In the past decade, DHS has deployed more resources, technology, and tactical infrastructure for securing our borders than at any other time in history. Technology and detection capabilities significantly contribute to identifying and deterring the entry of potentially dangerous people and contraband.
Between the Ports of Entry (POEs) along the Southwest border, CBP has made significant technology deployments in recent years. These deployments have included mobile surveillance units, ground sensors, and thermal imaging systems to increase its ability to detect illegal cross-border activity and contraband. CBP maintains 652 miles of fencing and has deployed other tactical infrastructure to key trafficking areas. Additionally, the CBP ReUse effort utilizes Department of Defense (DoD) technologies that are no longer needed by DOD but can be used to satisfy critical border security missions while saving DHS resources. For example, CBP received from DOD and delivered to its field operators aerostat technology, spectrometers, and night vision equipment. DHS and CBP have employed these technologies for line-watch persistent surveillance, aerial surveillance, detection of contraband and Weapons of Mass Destruction, and agent/officer safety. For example, tactical aerostats deployed in the Rio Grande Valley enabled the Border Patrol to seize over 100 tons of narcotics to date.
As part of its efforts to prevent the illicit smuggling of humans, drugs, and other contraband, CBP’s Border Patrol maintains checkpoints and a high level of vigilance on corridors of egress from our Nation’s borders. For example, this past May, San Diego Sector Border Patrol agents made an arrest after discovering more than 16 pounds of heroin in the back of a vehicle travelling along Interstate 5 in California. In August of this year, Border Patrol agents in the El Centro Sector, also in California, arrested a suspected drug smuggler during a check of a commercial passenger bus at the Highway 86 checkpoint after discovering packages of heroin hidden inside his shoes. And earlier this year, Border Patrol agents participated in “Operation Crazy Bull”, which targeted drug traffickers in northwest Pennsylvania and other states in the region. The operation, which resulted in the arrest of 15 suspected members of a DTO, included federal and state agencies and was the culmination of a two-year investigation initiated by the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).
At POEs, the Office of Field Operations (OFO) utilizes technology, such as non-intrusive inspection (NII) x-ray and gamma ray imaging systems, and canine teams to detect the illegal transit of drugs hidden on people, in cargo containers and in other conveyances. Since September 11, 2001, NII technology has been the cornerstone of the CBP multi-layered enforcement strategy. The President’s FY 2016 Budget requests an increase of $85.3 million for its NII program to fund recapitalization of aging systems. Without this funding increase, maintenance costs will increase, systems will become obsolete, system downtime will rise, all negatively impacting the effectiveness and cost of inspections due to the need for manual inspection, ultimately delaying the movement of legitimate trade and travel.
As of October 15, 2015, 315 Large-Scale (LS) NII systems are deployed to, and in between, our POEs. In FY 2014, LS-NII systems were used to conduct more than 7.2 million examinations resulting in more than 2,000 seizures and more than 249,000 pounds of seized drugs. Just a month ago, in three separate smuggling incidents, CBP officers at the DeConcini POE in Nogales, Arizona arrested three Mexican nationals and a U.S. citizen and seized more than 75 pounds of heroin, worth more than $1 million, that was concealed in their vehicles. This past August, CBP officers conducting a container check in San Juan, Puerto Rico discovered two backpacks with brick-shaped objects inside that tested positive for cocaine and heroin. While cargo containers may be a popular conveyance for smuggling, DTOs also move heroin in smaller quantities to try to evade detection. Last December, CBP officers working express consignment operations in Cincinnati seized five pounds of heroin when a shipment manifested as a baby playpen arrived at the facility for processing. The shipment was mailed from Malaysia and was destined for delivery in Toronto, Canada. ICE and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Serious and Organized Crime Division conducted a controlled delivery that resulted in the arrest of two individuals suspected of illegal importation and drug trafficking.
CBP also contributes to the whole-of-government effort to combat drug - related threats from Mexico by sharing critical information on travelers and cargo with investigative and intelligence partner agencies to identify and disrupt sophisticated routes and networks. Recognizing the need for open and sustainable channels to share information with our law enforcement and intelligence partners, CBP co-locates interagency personnel at its National Targeting Center (NTC) to support efforts to combat drug and contraband smuggling by integrating real-time tactical intelligence into CBP targeting efforts and enforcement actions. This whole-of-government counter network approach has resulted in TCOs being identified and dismantled, and their smuggling routes shut down. An example of this successful collaboration can be seen in the aggressive targeting of heroin transiting, or destined for, the United States. In FY 2015, CBP efforts at the NTC, in conjunction with increased cooperation from foreign and domestic law enforcement partners, resulted in 40 seizures of heroin with a gross weight of 47.7 kilograms as well as several arrests.
The Office of Field Operations National Canine Enforcement Program deploys 478 specialized detection canine teams throughout the nation. These canine teams are trained to detect drugs and concealed humans. The majority of the canine teams are concentrated in four field offices along the southwest border. Of those 478 canine teams, 49 of these teams are trained in the detection of firearms and currency. During FY 2015, OFO canine teams were responsible for the seizure of 603,283 pounds of drugs, $34,991,253 in seized property, and $39,323,455 in currency.
The United States Border Patrol (USBP) Canine Program deploys over 808 specialized detection canine teams throughout the nation. These canine teams are trained to detect narcotics and concealed humans. The majority of the canine teams are concentrated in the nine Sectors along the southwest border. Of those 808 canine teams, 37 of these teams are trained in the Search and Rescue discipline, 11 are trained the Human Remains Detection discipline, and 20 and trained in the Patrol discipline. During FY 2015 USBP canine teams were responsible for the seizure of 432,761 pounds of narcotics, $3,073,313 in currency, and 39,942 human apprehensions.
CBP also has capable and effective aerial and marine assets, including manned aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems and strategic and tactical aerostats, providing critical surveillance coverage and domain awareness toward counternarcotic efforts. In the maritime domain, CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) employs high speed Coastal Interceptor Vessels that are specifically designed and engineered with the speed, maneuverability, integrity and endurance to intercept and engage a variety of suspect non-compliant vessels in offshore waters, as well as the Great Lakes on the northern border.
This past May, AMO participated in a joint law enforcement operation with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) targeting a heroin ring in Philadelphia, PA, and Rochester, NY. AMO’s highly-trained air crews and marine agents conducted aerial and land surveillance and executed search warrants. The operation yielded the arrest of more than a dozen suspects and seizure of $187,000 in currency, 1.6 kg of heroin, five handguns, and an assault rifle.
CBP AMO P-3 Orion Aircraft (P-3s) have also been an integral part of the successful counternarcotic missions operating in coordination with Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S). The P-3s patrol in a 42 million-square mile area known as the Source and Transit Zone, which includes more than 41 nations, the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and seaboard approaches to the United States. In Fiscal Year 2014, CBP's P-3s operating out of Corpus Christi, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida flew more than 5,900 hours in support of counternarcotic missions resulting in 135 interdiction events of suspected smuggling vessels and aircraft. These events led to the total seizure of 57,374 kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of $9.47 billion.
Improved technology and enhanced capabilities have also expanded the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information between law enforcement partners working to dismantle DTO networks. For example, CBP’s Laboratories and Scientific Services Directorate uses advanced techniques to provide qualitative identification and quantitative determination as well as pollen analysis of heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine to assist with identifying potential drug smuggling routes. In addition, DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is working with CBP to develop, test, and pilot new technology for securing and scanning cargo, improving surveillance of the Southern border, and enhancing detection capabilities for radar-evading aircraft. S&T is also pursuing and fielding new technology to monitor storm drains, detect tunnels, track low-flying aircraft, monitor ports, and enhance current mobile/fixed radar and camera surveillance systems to increase border security. Recently, S&T-developed technology was put into operational use at the US-Mexican Border. These technologies included a new general aviation aircraft scanner in Laredo, TX, and a new Brownsville-Matamoros Rail Non-Intrusive Inspection Microwave Data Transmission System.
Intelligence and Information Sharing
Criminal intelligence sharing is a key component of countering drug-trafficking along the Southwest and Northern borders. CBP contributes to several initiatives to improve the combined intelligence capabilities of Federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners.
CBP hosts monthly briefings/teleconferences with Federal, state and local partners regarding the current state of the border – the Northern border and Southwest border – in order to monitor emerging trends and threats and provide a cross-component, multi-agency venue for discussing trends and threats. The monthly briefings focus on drugs, weapons, and currency interdictions and alien apprehensions both at and between the POEs. These briefings/teleconferences currently include participants from: the Government of Canada; the Government of Mexico; ICE; U.S. Coast Guard (USCG); DEA; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); U.S. Northern Command; Joint Interagency Task Force-South; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Attorneys’ Offices; Naval Investigative Command; State and Major Urban Area Fusion Centers; and other international, Federal, state, and local law enforcement as appropriate.
JTF operations increase information sharing with Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, improve border-wide criminal intelligence-led interdiction operations, and address transnational threats. Physical evidence gathering and forensic analysis is also valuable to the information sharing effort. Substantive and timely information sharing is critical in targeting and interdicting individuals that move drugs and illicit merchandise from the POEs to their destinations throughout the United States and Mexico.
CBP exchanges information with our partners within the Government of Mexico. This information sharing, facilitated by the CBP Attaché office in Mexico, has allowed for an unprecedented exchange of real-time information through deployments of personnel between our countries. Today, Mexican Federal Police personnel sit with our personnel in Tucson, Arizona, and Laredo, Texas, where they assist us with targeting criminal activity through the sharing of Mexico criminal history database information. Likewise, CBP personnel are assigned to Mexico City under the Joint Security Program where we exchange alerts on suspicious TCO movements through the monitoring of our Advance Passenger Information System. This information sharing has also led to numerous seizures and cases within Mexico that serve to disrupt the activities of TCOs throughout the Western Hemisphere.
Enhancing counternarcotic operations in the air and maritime environments, the Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC), a state-of-the-art law enforcement radar surveillance center, integrates data from multiple sensor sources to provide real-time information on suspect targets to responders at the Federal, state, and local levels. AMOC’s capabilities are enhanced by the continued integration of DHS and other Federal and Mexican personnel to increase efforts to identify, interdict, and investigate suspected drug trafficking in the air and maritime domains.
Operational Coordination
Our Nation’s borders – land, maritime, and air environments – cannot be effectively policed by a single DHS component or even a single governmental entity. A whole-of-government approach that leverages interagency and international partnerships as a force multiplier has been and will continue to be the most effective way to keep our border secure.
Providing critical capabilities toward the whole-of-government approach, CBP works extensively with our Federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners to address drug trafficking and other transnational threats along the Southwest border, Northern border, and coastal approaches. Our security efforts are enhanced through special joint operations and task forces conducted under the auspices of multi-agency enforcement teams. These teams are composed of representatives from international and U.S. federal law enforcement agencies who work together with state, local, and tribal agencies to target drug and transnational criminal activity, including investigations involving national security and organized crime.
Under the Secretary’s Unity of Effort initiative and with the three new DHS JTFs, CBP is enhancing our collaboration with other DHS components – specifically ICE and USCG – to leverage the unique resources, authorities, and capabilities of each agency to more effectively and efficiently execute our border security missions against TCOs, drug-trafficking and other threats and challenges.
Through JTF-W’s integrated efforts in the South Texas Corridor (STC), two TCOs were impacted utilizing counter network strategies and unity of effort amongst DHS components. In addition, the STC employed integrated intelligence collection to enhance joint interdiction and investigations significantly disrupting the TCOs ability to smuggle their commodity through the application of consequences. These two organizations were designated as priority targets culminating into enforcement actions under Operations Fusion One-Five and Project Highway 83.
Under Operation Fusion One-Five, multiple members of the Brewster Criminal Organization, to include the leader of the organization, were targeted and arrested. This investigation resulted in an additional 22 criminal arrests, 497 UDAs, and the seizure of various types of narcotics. On August 10, 2015, members of the Brewster Organization appeared in federal court and received a cumulative sentence of 12.5 years for their roles in human smuggling. This was an HSI led investigation with support from CBP assets.
Under Operation Project Highway 83, six TCOs operating within the STC were targeted as part of an illicit network utilizing money service businesses to facilitate human smuggling. This investigation led to the issuance of 31 arrest warrants in San Antonio, Dallas, and Crystal City, Texas. To date, over 400 individuals involved in this network have received consequences ranging from arrests, indictment, and/or administrative actions. This investigation was initiated and led by the HSI Eagle Pass and Laredo Offices, assisted by USBP Del Rio and Laredo Sectors, and OFO Laredo Field Office.
CBP is a critical partner in the ICE-led Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BESTs), which are composed of Federal, state, local, and international law enforcement and intelligence stakeholders working together to counter TCOs and enhance border security. BESTs currently operate in 37 locations, including 14 along the Southwest border. In FY 2015, BESTs made more than 3,700 criminal arrests and 960 administrative arrests; seized more than 269,100 pounds of drugs, 800 weapons, and $29 million in currency and monetary instruments; and federal prosecutors obtained more than 2,100 indictments and 1,700 convictions in BEST-investigated cases.
Other investigative agencies such as ICE-HSI, DEA, and FBI utilize AMO specific skills for air and marine relevant investigations, in order to help identify and dismantle the organized flow of narcotics and trans-criminal organizations. This leads to significant intelligence and seizures, and the critical information gained is often crucial to identifying TCO suspects, associates, and accomplices. The threat in the air and maritime domains require specialized skills and tactics tailored to the specifics of each of those environments. In the maritime domain, AMO personnel routinely augments vessel crews from investigative partner agencies when air and marine investigative skills and technical expertise are needed for investigation or operation of these maritime assets.
In the air domain, AMO detects, identifies, investigates, and interdicts potential air threats to the United States including general aviation (GA) aircraft involved in the aerial transit of contraband. The AMOC monitors complex airway traffic to identify illicit use of aircraft and those attempting to blend in with legitimate traffic. AMO, through its national SKY PRO initiative and in collaboration with ICE-HSI, the Federal Aviation Administration, and state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies, works to enhance law enforcement interactions with the GA community to increase awareness and intelligence on international and domestic smuggling activities.
Also, AMO actively participates in Operation Martillo, an international counter illicit trafficking initiative whereby U.S. and regional partner nations’ military and law enforcement agencies patrol the air and sea environments in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern Pacific on a year-round basis.
Because DTOs are also known to use legitimate commercial modes of travel and transport to smuggle drugs and other illicit goods, CBP partners with the private sector to provide anti-drug smuggling training to air, sea, and land commercial transport companies (carriers). The overall goals of these programs and their training component are to encourage commercial carriers to share with CBP the burden of stopping the flow of illicit drugs; to deter smugglers from using commercial carriers to smuggle drugs; and to provide carriers with the incentive to improve their security and their drug smuggling awareness. The Carrier Initiative Program is a voluntary training program directed at employees of carriers with route systems that are high risk for drug smuggling. The Super Carrier Initiative Program is for those carriers that face an extraordinarily high risk from drug traffickers. Participating carriers sign agreements stating that the carrier will exercise the highest degree of care and diligence in securing their facilities and conveyances, while CBP agrees to conduct site surveys, make recommendations, and provide training. CBP and various carriers have signed over 3,800 Carrier Initiative Agreements and 27 Super Carrier Agreements.
Heroin trafficking is a global problem, and CBP continues to work with our international partners to share information and leverage resources to combat this threat. Through the 21st Century Border Management Initiative, the U.S. Government and Government of Mexico (GOM) are working to strengthen our collaborative relationship and efforts to secure and facilitate the cross-border flows of people and cargo. CBP also has Border Patrol International Liaison Units (ILU) who facilitate cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement authorities as part of a multi-layered effort to target, disrupt, and dismantle criminal organizations. During FY 2015, the U.S. Border Patrol and GOM conducted multiple joint bi-national operations targeting TCOs. During these operations, and as a direct result of intelligence sharing with GOM, USBP and GOM were able to locate more than 30 illicit tunnels, and seize approximately 80,000 lbs. of drugs.
AMOC’s coordinating efforts with the GOM and the deployment of shared surveillance technology has enabled the GOM to focus aviation and maritime enforcement efforts to better combat TCO operations in Northern Mexico and the contiguous U.S./Mexico border. For example, this past January, officers working at the AMOC detected a suspicious aircraft travelling north towards the United States. AMOC subsequently alerted GOM of the activity, and both the Mexican Federal Police and Air Force responded to investigate. The abandoned aircraft was located by Mexican officials a short time later, where 27 bags containing approximately 389 kilos methamphetamine, 79 kilos of cocaine, 79 kilos of white heroin, and 1.5 kilos of black tar heroin were discovered and seized.
CBP, together with our international, federal, state, local, and tribal partners, is committed to reducing the risk associated with TCOs by addressing threats within the Southern Border and Approaches Joint Operating Area. The establishment of JTFs marks a renewed commitment to seek out and coordinate optimal, multi-component authorities, capabilities, competencies, and partnership expertise to combat all threats to the homeland.
Lastly, it is important to acknowledge the significant strides that Mexico has taken in recent years to address transnational organized crime generally, and drugs smuggling specifically. I noted some examples of this earlier, but I wanted to highlight for the Committee that CBP’s relationship with its Mexican counterparts is stronger today than it has ever been. We receive information from Mexican authorities on a daily basis that helps us better target drugs smugglers at the border. Just last month, I participated in a high level bilateral and interagency security cooperation meeting in Mexico City, where senior Mexican officials committed to working with the U.S. Government even more closely—including expanding efforts to combat heroin cultivation, production, and trafficking, and sharing more information on smuggling routes and networks, and crafting a binational action plan specifically focused on heroin smuggling. While more can always be done, I am pleased that Mexico and the United States are working in close cooperation as we seek to identify, interdict, and take down the cartels.
Conclusion
CBP, through collaboration and coordination with our many Federal, state, local, tribal, international government, and other partners, has made great strides with regard to the integrity and security of our borders.
With continued support from Congress, CBP, in coordination with our partners, will continue to refine and further enhance the effectiveness of our detection and interdiction capabilities to combat transnational threats and the entry of heroin into the United States. We will continue to work with the intelligence community and our law enforcement partners to improve the efficiency of information sharing with relevant partners, to guide strategies, identify trafficking patterns and trends, develop tactics, and execute operations to address the challenges and threats posed by TCOsto the safety and security of the American public.
Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions.

Written testimony of CBP Commissioner R.Gil Kerlikowske for a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing titled “America’s Heroin Epidemic at the Border: Local, State, and Federal Law Enforcement Efforts to Combat Illicit Narcotic Trafficking”
Release Date: November 23, 2015
Phoenix, Arizona
Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear today in Arizona to discuss the role of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in combating the flow of dangerous drugs into the United States.
The use and availability of heroin and other illegal opioids, as well as the nonmedical use of prescription opioids in the United States, have been increasing at an alarming rate. The situation is one of the most important, complex, and difficult challenges our Nation faces today. According to a recent report1 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, overdose deaths involving heroin nearly doubled between 2011 and 2013 and are climbing.
There is no single entity, nor a single solution, that can address this problem. Tackling this complex threat involves a united, comprehensive strategy and aggressive approach by multiple entities – from law enforcement, science, medicine, education, social work, and the public health sector – across all levels of government. While continued efforts to interdict heroin and other drugs at the border are a key aspect of addressing this crisis, interdictions, arrests and convictions alone cannot mitigate the far-reaching effects of nonmedical prescription opioid and heroin abuse. We need to focus on prevention and treatment, and identify the characteristics of developing cases of opioid use disorder before they escalate. We must also concentrate on deterring opioid trafficking by transnational criminal organizations (TCO), cartels, and other distribution networks.
To do this effectively, we must better integrate our efforts, share information, and partner with federal, state, local and tribal communities as well as the private sector. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Heroin Response Strategy,2 recently announced by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), will foster a collaborative partnership between public health and law enforcement entities. The strategy seeks a comprehensive response to this complex epidemic by addressing the broad range of efforts required – on the international, national, and local levels – to reduce the use, distribution, and trafficking of this dangerous substance.
As America’s unified border agency, CBP has a critical role in the efforts to keep dangerous drugs like heroin and other opioids out of the hands of the American public. Combating TCOs and drug trafficking organizations (DTO) is a key component of our multi-layered, risk-based approach to enhance the security of our borders. This layered approach to security reduces our reliance on any single point or program, and extends our zone of security outward, ensuring that our physical border is not the first or last line of defense, but one of many.
Secretary Johnson’s Unity of Effort initiative has put in place new and strengthened management processes to enable more effective DHS component operations to address TCOs, drug-trafficking, and other cross-border threats. In addition, DHS-wide border and maritime security activities are guided by the new Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan and complement the Administration’s National Drug Control Strategy, and the National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy. Aimed at leveraging the range of unique Department roles, responsibilities, and capabilities, the Campaign enhances our ability to work together in a more unified way to address these comprehensive threats. In support of this new Campaign, on November 20, 2014, the Secretary announced the creation of three new joint task forces (JTF) to coordinate the efforts of the combined resources of DHS component agencies. Joint Task Force-East is responsible for the maritime approaches to the United States across the southeast, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Caribbean. Joint Task Force-West is responsible for the southwest land border from Texas to California. And, supporting the work of the other two task forces is a standing Joint Task Force for Investigations. These three JTFs reached full operational capability on July 30 of this year.

 Interdictions and Trends
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, CBP officers and agents seized 3.8 million pounds of drugs across the country. During FY 2015, CBP saw a four- percent increase from FY 2014 in overall nationwide seizure events, but a six- percent decrease in drug seizures by weight. Additionally, heroin total seizure amounts for FY 2015 increased 23 percent to more than 6,000 pounds. CBP seizures of clandestinely made opioids like fentanyl, while relatively small compared to heroin, have also significantly increased from 1.1 kg in FY 2013 to 3.7 kg seized in FY 2014 and 89.7 kg seized in FY 2015. These figures demonstrate the continued effectiveness of CBP’s detection and interdiction abilities, but may also indicate that manufacturers and traffickers are increasing the production and supply of heroin in the United States.
Mexican manufacturers and traffickers continue to be major suppliers of heroin to the United States. Although the vast majority of CBP’s heroin interdictions are seized from DTO smuggling networks along the Southwest land border, CBP also interdicts this dangerous drug in all environments and transportation modes. The reach and influence of Mexican cartels, notably Los Zetas, and the Gulf, Juarez, Jalisco New Generation, and Sinaloa Cartels, stretches across and beyond the Southwest border, operating through loose business ties with smaller organizations in cities across the United States. The threat of DTOs is dynamic; rival organizations are constantly vying for control, and as U.S. and Mexican anti-drug efforts disrupt criminal networks, new groups arise and form new alliances.
DHS Resources and Capabilities to Counter Drug Trafficking Organizations
CBP, responsible for America’s frontline border security, has a significant role in the Nation’s efforts to combat the cross-border criminal activity of cartels and other drug trafficking organizations. In the past decade, DHS has deployed more resources, technology, and tactical infrastructure for securing our borders than at any other time in history. Technology and detection capabilities significantly contribute to identifying and deterring the entry of potentially dangerous people and contraband.
Between the Ports of Entry (POEs) along the Southwest border, CBP has made significant technology deployments in recent years. These deployments have included mobile surveillance units, ground sensors, and thermal imaging systems to increase its ability to detect illegal cross-border activity and contraband. CBP maintains 652 miles of fencing and has deployed other tactical infrastructure to key trafficking areas. Additionally, the CBP ReUse effort utilizes Department of Defense (DoD) technologies that are no longer needed by DOD but can be used to satisfy critical border security missions while saving DHS resources. For example, CBP received from DOD and delivered to its field operators aerostat technology, spectrometers, and night vision equipment. DHS and CBP have employed these technologies for line-watch persistent surveillance, aerial surveillance, detection of contraband and Weapons of Mass Destruction, and agent/officer safety. For example, tactical aerostats deployed in the Rio Grande Valley enabled the Border Patrol to seize over 100 tons of narcotics to date.
As part of its efforts to prevent the illicit smuggling of humans, drugs, and other contraband, CBP’s Border Patrol maintains checkpoints and a high level of vigilance on corridors of egress from our Nation’s borders. For example, this past May, San Diego Sector Border Patrol agents made an arrest after discovering more than 16 pounds of heroin in the back of a vehicle travelling along Interstate 5 in California. In August of this year, Border Patrol agents in the El Centro Sector, also in California, arrested a suspected drug smuggler during a check of a commercial passenger bus at the Highway 86 checkpoint after discovering packages of heroin hidden inside his shoes. And earlier this year, Border Patrol agents participated in “Operation Crazy Bull”, which targeted drug traffickers in northwest Pennsylvania and other states in the region. The operation, which resulted in the arrest of 15 suspected members of a DTO, included federal and state agencies and was the culmination of a two-year investigation initiated by the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).
At POEs, the Office of Field Operations (OFO) utilizes technology, such as non-intrusive inspection (NII) x-ray and gamma ray imaging systems, and canine teams to detect the illegal transit of drugs hidden on people, in cargo containers and in other conveyances. Since September 11, 2001, NII technology has been the cornerstone of the CBP multi-layered enforcement strategy. The President’s FY 2016 Budget requests an increase of $85.3 million for its NII program to fund recapitalization of aging systems. Without this funding increase, maintenance costs will increase, systems will become obsolete, system downtime will rise, all negatively impacting the effectiveness and cost of inspections due to the need for manual inspection, ultimately delaying the movement of legitimate trade and travel.
As of October 15, 2015, 315 Large-Scale (LS) NII systems are deployed to, and in between, our POEs. In FY 2014, LS-NII systems were used to conduct more than 7.2 million examinations resulting in more than 2,000 seizures and more than 249,000 pounds of seized drugs. Just a month ago, in three separate smuggling incidents, CBP officers at the DeConcini POE in Nogales, Arizona arrested three Mexican nationals and a U.S. citizen and seized more than 75 pounds of heroin, worth more than $1 million, that was concealed in their vehicles. This past August, CBP officers conducting a container check in San Juan, Puerto Rico discovered two backpacks with brick-shaped objects inside that tested positive for cocaine and heroin. While cargo containers may be a popular conveyance for smuggling, DTOs also move heroin in smaller quantities to try to evade detection. Last December, CBP officers working express consignment operations in Cincinnati seized five pounds of heroin when a shipment manifested as a baby playpen arrived at the facility for processing. The shipment was mailed from Malaysia and was destined for delivery in Toronto, Canada. ICE and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Serious and Organized Crime Division conducted a controlled delivery that resulted in the arrest of two individuals suspected of illegal importation and drug trafficking.
CBP also contributes to the whole-of-government effort to combat drug - related threats from Mexico by sharing critical information on travelers and cargo with investigative and intelligence partner agencies to identify and disrupt sophisticated routes and networks. Recognizing the need for open and sustainable channels to share information with our law enforcement and intelligence partners, CBP co-locates interagency personnel at its National Targeting Center (NTC) to support efforts to combat drug and contraband smuggling by integrating real-time tactical intelligence into CBP targeting efforts and enforcement actions. This whole-of-government counter network approach has resulted in TCOs being identified and dismantled, and their smuggling routes shut down. An example of this successful collaboration can be seen in the aggressive targeting of heroin transiting, or destined for, the United States. In FY 2015, CBP efforts at the NTC, in conjunction with increased cooperation from foreign and domestic law enforcement partners, resulted in 40 seizures of heroin with a gross weight of 47.7 kilograms as well as several arrests.
The Office of Field Operations National Canine Enforcement Program deploys 478 specialized detection canine teams throughout the nation. These canine teams are trained to detect drugs and concealed humans. The majority of the canine teams are concentrated in four field offices along the southwest border. Of those 478 canine teams, 49 of these teams are trained in the detection of firearms and currency. During FY 2015, OFO canine teams were responsible for the seizure of 603,283 pounds of drugs, $34,991,253 in seized property, and $39,323,455 in currency.
The United States Border Patrol (USBP) Canine Program deploys over 808 specialized detection canine teams throughout the nation. These canine teams are trained to detect narcotics and concealed humans. The majority of the canine teams are concentrated in the nine Sectors along the southwest border. Of those 808 canine teams, 37 of these teams are trained in the Search and Rescue discipline, 11 are trained the Human Remains Detection discipline, and 20 and trained in the Patrol discipline. During FY 2015 USBP canine teams were responsible for the seizure of 432,761 pounds of narcotics, $3,073,313 in currency, and 39,942 human apprehensions.
CBP also has capable and effective aerial and marine assets, including manned aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems and strategic and tactical aerostats, providing critical surveillance coverage and domain awareness toward counternarcotic efforts. In the maritime domain, CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) employs high speed Coastal Interceptor Vessels that are specifically designed and engineered with the speed, maneuverability, integrity and endurance to intercept and engage a variety of suspect non-compliant vessels in offshore waters, as well as the Great Lakes on the northern border.
This past May, AMO participated in a joint law enforcement operation with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) targeting a heroin ring in Philadelphia, PA, and Rochester, NY. AMO’s highly-trained air crews and marine agents conducted aerial and land surveillance and executed search warrants. The operation yielded the arrest of more than a dozen suspects and seizure of $187,000 in currency, 1.6 kg of heroin, five handguns, and an assault rifle.
CBP AMO P-3 Orion Aircraft (P-3s) have also been an integral part of the successful counternarcotic missions operating in coordination with Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S). The P-3s patrol in a 42 million-square mile area known as the Source and Transit Zone, which includes more than 41 nations, the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and seaboard approaches to the United States. In Fiscal Year 2014, CBP's P-3s operating out of Corpus Christi, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida flew more than 5,900 hours in support of counternarcotic missions resulting in 135 interdiction events of suspected smuggling vessels and aircraft. These events led to the total seizure of 57,374 kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of $9.47 billion.
Improved technology and enhanced capabilities have also expanded the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information between law enforcement partners working to dismantle DTO networks. For example, CBP’s Laboratories and Scientific Services Directorate uses advanced techniques to provide qualitative identification and quantitative determination as well as pollen analysis of heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and methamphetamine to assist with identifying potential drug smuggling routes. In addition, DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is working with CBP to develop, test, and pilot new technology for securing and scanning cargo, improving surveillance of the Southern border, and enhancing detection capabilities for radar-evading aircraft. S&T is also pursuing and fielding new technology to monitor storm drains, detect tunnels, track low-flying aircraft, monitor ports, and enhance current mobile/fixed radar and camera surveillance systems to increase border security. Recently, S&T-developed technology was put into operational use at the US-Mexican Border. These technologies included a new general aviation aircraft scanner in Laredo, TX, and a new Brownsville-Matamoros Rail Non-Intrusive Inspection Microwave Data Transmission System.
Intelligence and Information Sharing
Criminal intelligence sharing is a key component of countering drug-trafficking along the Southwest and Northern borders. CBP contributes to several initiatives to improve the combined intelligence capabilities of Federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners.
CBP hosts monthly briefings/teleconferences with Federal, state and local partners regarding the current state of the border – the Northern border and Southwest border – in order to monitor emerging trends and threats and provide a cross-component, multi-agency venue for discussing trends and threats. The monthly briefings focus on drugs, weapons, and currency interdictions and alien apprehensions both at and between the POEs. These briefings/teleconferences currently include participants from: the Government of Canada; the Government of Mexico; ICE; U.S. Coast Guard (USCG); DEA; Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); U.S. Northern Command; Joint Interagency Task Force-South; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Attorneys’ Offices; Naval Investigative Command; State and Major Urban Area Fusion Centers; and other international, Federal, state, and local law enforcement as appropriate.
JTF operations increase information sharing with Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, improve border-wide criminal intelligence-led interdiction operations, and address transnational threats. Physical evidence gathering and forensic analysis is also valuable to the information sharing effort. Substantive and timely information sharing is critical in targeting and interdicting individuals that move drugs and illicit merchandise from the POEs to their destinations throughout the United States and Mexico.
CBP exchanges information with our partners within the Government of Mexico. This information sharing, facilitated by the CBP Attaché office in Mexico, has allowed for an unprecedented exchange of real-time information through deployments of personnel between our countries. Today, Mexican Federal Police personnel sit with our personnel in Tucson, Arizona, and Laredo, Texas, where they assist us with targeting criminal activity through the sharing of Mexico criminal history database information. Likewise, CBP personnel are assigned to Mexico City under the Joint Security Program where we exchange alerts on suspicious TCO movements through the monitoring of our Advance Passenger Information System. This information sharing has also led to numerous seizures and cases within Mexico that serve to disrupt the activities of TCOs throughout the Western Hemisphere.
Enhancing counternarcotic operations in the air and maritime environments, the Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC), a state-of-the-art law enforcement radar surveillance center, integrates data from multiple sensor sources to provide real-time information on suspect targets to responders at the Federal, state, and local levels. AMOC’s capabilities are enhanced by the continued integration of DHS and other Federal and Mexican personnel to increase efforts to identify, interdict, and investigate suspected drug trafficking in the air and maritime domains.
Operational Coordination
Our Nation’s borders – land, maritime, and air environments – cannot be effectively policed by a single DHS component or even a single governmental entity. A whole-of-government approach that leverages interagency and international partnerships as a force multiplier has been and will continue to be the most effective way to keep our border secure.
Providing critical capabilities toward the whole-of-government approach, CBP works extensively with our Federal, state, local, tribal, and international partners to address drug trafficking and other transnational threats along the Southwest border, Northern border, and coastal approaches. Our security efforts are enhanced through special joint operations and task forces conducted under the auspices of multi-agency enforcement teams. These teams are composed of representatives from international and U.S. federal law enforcement agencies who work together with state, local, and tribal agencies to target drug and transnational criminal activity, including investigations involving national security and organized crime.
Under the Secretary’s Unity of Effort initiative and with the three new DHS JTFs, CBP is enhancing our collaboration with other DHS components – specifically ICE and USCG – to leverage the unique resources, authorities, and capabilities of each agency to more effectively and efficiently execute our border security missions against TCOs, drug-trafficking and other threats and challenges.
Through JTF-W’s integrated efforts in the South Texas Corridor (STC), two TCOs were impacted utilizing counter network strategies and unity of effort amongst DHS components. In addition, the STC employed integrated intelligence collection to enhance joint interdiction and investigations significantly disrupting the TCOs ability to smuggle their commodity through the application of consequences. These two organizations were designated as priority targets culminating into enforcement actions under Operations Fusion One-Five and Project Highway 83.
Under Operation Fusion One-Five, multiple members of the Brewster Criminal Organization, to include the leader of the organization, were targeted and arrested. This investigation resulted in an additional 22 criminal arrests, 497 UDAs, and the seizure of various types of narcotics. On August 10, 2015, members of the Brewster Organization appeared in federal court and received a cumulative sentence of 12.5 years for their roles in human smuggling. This was an HSI led investigation with support from CBP assets.
Under Operation Project Highway 83, six TCOs operating within the STC were targeted as part of an illicit network utilizing money service businesses to facilitate human smuggling. This investigation led to the issuance of 31 arrest warrants in San Antonio, Dallas, and Crystal City, Texas. To date, over 400 individuals involved in this network have received consequences ranging from arrests, indictment, and/or administrative actions. This investigation was initiated and led by the HSI Eagle Pass and Laredo Offices, assisted by USBP Del Rio and Laredo Sectors, and OFO Laredo Field Office.
CBP is a critical partner in the ICE-led Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BESTs), which are composed of Federal, state, local, and international law enforcement and intelligence stakeholders working together to counter TCOs and enhance border security. BESTs currently operate in 37 locations, including 14 along the Southwest border. In FY 2015, BESTs made more than 3,700 criminal arrests and 960 administrative arrests; seized more than 269,100 pounds of drugs, 800 weapons, and $29 million in currency and monetary instruments; and federal prosecutors obtained more than 2,100 indictments and 1,700 convictions in BEST-investigated cases.
Other investigative agencies such as ICE-HSI, DEA, and FBI utilize AMO specific skills for air and marine relevant investigations, in order to help identify and dismantle the organized flow of narcotics and trans-criminal organizations. This leads to significant intelligence and seizures, and the critical information gained is often crucial to identifying TCO suspects, associates, and accomplices. The threat in the air and maritime domains require specialized skills and tactics tailored to the specifics of each of those environments. In the maritime domain, AMO personnel routinely augments vessel crews from investigative partner agencies when air and marine investigative skills and technical expertise are needed for investigation or operation of these maritime assets.
In the air domain, AMO detects, identifies, investigates, and interdicts potential air threats to the United States including general aviation (GA) aircraft involved in the aerial transit of contraband. The AMOC monitors complex airway traffic to identify illicit use of aircraft and those attempting to blend in with legitimate traffic. AMO, through its national SKY PRO initiative and in collaboration with ICE-HSI, the Federal Aviation Administration, and state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies, works to enhance law enforcement interactions with the GA community to increase awareness and intelligence on international and domestic smuggling activities.
Also, AMO actively participates in Operation Martillo, an international counter illicit trafficking initiative whereby U.S. and regional partner nations’ military and law enforcement agencies patrol the air and sea environments in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern Pacific on a year-round basis.
Because DTOs are also known to use legitimate commercial modes of travel and transport to smuggle drugs and other illicit goods, CBP partners with the private sector to provide anti-drug smuggling training to air, sea, and land commercial transport companies (carriers). The overall goals of these programs and their training component are to encourage commercial carriers to share with CBP the burden of stopping the flow of illicit drugs; to deter smugglers from using commercial carriers to smuggle drugs; and to provide carriers with the incentive to improve their security and their drug smuggling awareness. The Carrier Initiative Program is a voluntary training program directed at employees of carriers with route systems that are high risk for drug smuggling. The Super Carrier Initiative Program is for those carriers that face an extraordinarily high risk from drug traffickers. Participating carriers sign agreements stating that the carrier will exercise the highest degree of care and diligence in securing their facilities and conveyances, while CBP agrees to conduct site surveys, make recommendations, and provide training. CBP and various carriers have signed over 3,800 Carrier Initiative Agreements and 27 Super Carrier Agreements.
Heroin trafficking is a global problem, and CBP continues to work with our international partners to share information and leverage resources to combat this threat. Through the 21st Century Border Management Initiative, the U.S. Government and Government of Mexico (GOM) are working to strengthen our collaborative relationship and efforts to secure and facilitate the cross-border flows of people and cargo. CBP also has Border Patrol International Liaison Units (ILU) who facilitate cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement authorities as part of a multi-layered effort to target, disrupt, and dismantle criminal organizations. During FY 2015, the U.S. Border Patrol and GOM conducted multiple joint bi-national operations targeting TCOs. During these operations, and as a direct result of intelligence sharing with GOM, USBP and GOM were able to locate more than 30 illicit tunnels, and seize approximately 80,000 lbs. of drugs.
AMOC’s coordinating efforts with the GOM and the deployment of shared surveillance technology has enabled the GOM to focus aviation and maritime enforcement efforts to better combat TCO operations in Northern Mexico and the contiguous U.S./Mexico border. For example, this past January, officers working at the AMOC detected a suspicious aircraft travelling north towards the United States. AMOC subsequently alerted GOM of the activity, and both the Mexican Federal Police and Air Force responded to investigate. The abandoned aircraft was located by Mexican officials a short time later, where 27 bags containing approximately 389 kilos methamphetamine, 79 kilos of cocaine, 79 kilos of white heroin, and 1.5 kilos of black tar heroin were discovered and seized.
CBP, together with our international, federal, state, local, and tribal partners, is committed to reducing the risk associated with TCOs by addressing threats within the Southern Border and Approaches Joint Operating Area. The establishment of JTFs marks a renewed commitment to seek out and coordinate optimal, multi-component authorities, capabilities, competencies, and partnership expertise to combat all threats to the homeland.
Lastly, it is important to acknowledge the significant strides that Mexico has taken in recent years to address transnational organized crime generally, and drugs smuggling specifically. I noted some examples of this earlier, but I wanted to highlight for the Committee that CBP’s relationship with its Mexican counterparts is stronger today than it has ever been. We receive information from Mexican authorities on a daily basis that helps us better target drugs smugglers at the border. Just last month, I participated in a high level bilateral and interagency security cooperation meeting in Mexico City, where senior Mexican officials committed to working with the U.S. Government even more closely—including expanding efforts to combat heroin cultivation, production, and trafficking, and sharing more information on smuggling routes and networks, and crafting a binational action plan specifically focused on heroin smuggling. While more can always be done, I am pleased that Mexico and the United States are working in close cooperation as we seek to identify, interdict, and take down the cartels.
Conclusion
CBP, through collaboration and coordination with our many Federal, state, local, tribal, international government, and other partners, has made great strides with regard to the integrity and security of our borders.
With continued support from Congress, CBP, in coordination with our partners, will continue to refine and further enhance the effectiveness of our detection and interdiction capabilities to combat transnational threats and the entry of heroin into the United States. We will continue to work with the intelligence community and our law enforcement partners to improve the efficiency of information sharing with relevant partners, to guide strategies, identify trafficking patterns and trends, develop tactics, and execute operations to address the challenges and threats posed by TCOsto the safety and security of the American public.
Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions.

Jeb Bush Campaign Press Release - Securing the Border and Enforcing Our Immigration Laws
August 03, 2015
When Clint Bolick and I published Immigration Wars in 2013, we presented a number of proposals to strengthen America's immigration policy. Border security and the interior enforcement of immigration laws, including a greater role for states, formed key parts of this package of reforms. We emphasized that finding a practical solution to the status of the people who are here illegally today is a nonstarter if our borders are not secure against future illegal immigration.
I believe that for those already in the country, we need to put in place a rigorous path that requires individuals to pass a thorough criminal background check, pay fines, pay taxes, learn English, obtain a provisional work permit and work, not receive federal government assistance, and over an extended period of time earn legal status. But any plan to address the status of illegal immigrants must be accompanied by a robust strategy to improve border security.
Securing the border is possible, but it will require Washington to move beyond divisive rhetoric. The following six proposals offer concrete steps that the federal government should take to help secure the border and enforce our immigration laws. We must transform immigration from a broken system into one that benefits every American.
Border Security
1. A forward-leaning Border Patrol with the flexibility to deploy resources to meet threats.
In some cases, it takes Border Patrol agents over an hour to get to the remote and rugged areas they need to patrol. Creating more forward-operating bases maximizes agents' time on the border by stationing them there (much like a fire station) for multiple days at a time. We also have to interdict drugs and people as close to the border as possible by using quick reaction teams that go after the threat the moment it crosses the border. An approach to border security that waits until illicit traffic is miles into the interior of the country effectively cedes sovereign U.S. territory to the cartels and smugglers. These forward-leaning Border Patrol agents should be at the front line of a multi-layered ""defense in depth"" where additional lines of defense increase the likelihood of detecting and apprehending illegal crossers.
The Border Patrol also must have the flexibility to deploy resources as needed. The flow of illegal immigrants can and will shift over time. For example, in the mid-2000s, the Tucson, Arizona sector saw the most traffic based on the number of apprehensions; after we applied more resources, people went to less secure areas of the border, such as the Rio Grande Valley sector in South Texas. Our border security posture must be as nimble as the cartels' ability to shift operations to a different area.
2. Use new technologies to achieve continuous surveillance of the border.
Having the ability to detect illegal crossings is necessary to secure the border. In order to apprehend a person, you first have to know when and where a crossing occurs. That is one of the biggest problems right now—we do not have enough surveillance on the border and we are being beaten without knowing it. We can leverage technology to constantly watch the border, develop intelligence, and put our agents and resources where they are most effective at preventing and apprehending illicit border crossers.
Technology, such as drones, advanced sensors, and radar, can give our agents a fuller picture of the illegal activity that in turn will enable the country to better allocate resources on the border. More than that, technology can make securing the border safer for our agents who will not have to respond to false alarms. And because the cartels do extensive counter-surveillance on our agents through the use of spotters who report on the movement of the Border Patrol, we need to keep them guessing by using mobile technology.
3. Bolster border infrastructure and improve access to federal lands.
Road construction and maintenance can provide agents access to areas of the border that would otherwise go unpatrolled. New roads are needed on the border to secure access to remote and rugged terrain to interdict smugglers, and respond to the detection of illicit traffic by technology. Likewise, new boat ramps can provide Border Patrol riverine units more points to put their vessels in the water so they can patrol more effectively.
As noted in Immigration Wars, fencing is a component of border security. When combined with surveillance technology and agents to detect and respond to crossings, fencing or other barriers can serve several purposes, including: (1) deterring illegal entries by making it more difficult to cross the border, (2) facilitating enforcement by increasing the time available to respond and apprehend people, and (3) steering dangerous criminals and traffickers away from populated areas, improving public safety. Sufficient funding should be provided to maintain, improve, and expand fences where appropriate (e.g., based on the terrain along the border or the proximity of populated areas).
Access to federal lands is another key part of improving access to border areas. Currently, agents have to navigate byzantine environmental rules and regulations to access federal lands, which make up a large portion of the southwest border. Removing these restrictions would help untie the hands of our agents to patrol every inch of the border.
Interior Enforcement
4. Require electronic verification of employment eligibility.
Many illegal immigrants come to the United States for jobs and, despite the prohibition on hiring illegal immigrants, they are hired in large numbers. If we decrease the likelihood of being employed, crossing the border will be less rewarding. However, the current I-9 system does not effectively prevent the hiring of illegal workers. We need a strong E-Verify system to ensure that American businesses are not hiring illegal immigrants. E-Verify is an Internet-based system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States. Employers should not be penalized if they use E-Verify in good faith and receive an incorrect eligibility confirmation. Identity theft protections are also necessary. Finally, with an improved E-Verify, the government must enforce penalties for violations.
5. Identify and send home the people who are entering the United States and overstaying their visas or otherwise violating the terms of their admission.
In its widely-cited 2006 review, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that nearly half of all illegal immigrants living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport and overstayed their visas. While we need to find a practical solution to the status of people who are here illegally today, as we secure the border going forward, we also need to identify and send home the people who enter the country legally but overstay their visas or otherwise violate the terms of their admission.
Unfortunately, without a system in place to track adequately who has actually left the country, it is difficult to know who these individuals are. A biometric exit system must be rapidly implemented so that immigration and national security officials know with certainty who is, and is not, in this country.
We also need to increase federal resources dedicated to overstay enforcement. In FY 2012, the federal agency that investigates overstay cases, among other activities, spent less than 2 percent of their time on these cases.
Furthermore, we need to create intergovernmental task forces to locate and apprehend overstays, especially those who present public safety risks. With proper training and supervision, state and local police could augment federal agents because they know their communities and have more boots on the ground.
6. Crack down on sanctuary cities that undermine efforts to enforce immigration laws.
We should withhold federal law enforcement funds for cities that undermine federal immigration laws and make sure we detain and deport illegal immigrants who are serious criminals. We should also expand federal partnerships that train state and local police to help enforce immigration laws, particularly in jails and prisons. When I was Governor of Florida, the state was a trailblazer in working with the federal government to enforce immigration laws. In 2002, Florida signed the first agreement with the federal government under the Section 287(g) program, which trains state and local police to help enforce immigration laws.
These six proposals, when combined with a rigorous path to earned legal status, would realistically and honestly address the status of the 11 million people here illegally today and protect against future illegal immigration. While passions run high on this issue, there is no rational plan to deport millions of people that the American people would support. It would disrupt communities and families and could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. The policies I am advocating can ultimately receive bipartisan support in Congress and become law. President Obama has had six-and-a-half years to address our broken immigration system. Instead of leading the nation towards consensus, he has divided the country. One has to ask whether he is more interested in providing a wedge issue for his party than offering a solution for the country. There should be no doubt where I stand. I am committed to addressing the problem of illegal immigration in a comprehensive fashion so we can respond to the legitimate concerns of the American people and build stronger support for legal immigration, which if done properly can be a catalyst to bring us to strong, sustained economic growth that will benefit every American.

          The Constitution
        The power of the Executive Branch is vested in the President of the United States, who also acts as head of state and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The President is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress and, to that end, appoints the heads of the federal agencies, including the Cabinet. The Vice President is also part of the Executive Branch, ready to assume the Presidency should the need arise.
The Cabinet and independent federal agencies are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement and administration of federal laws. These departments and agencies have missions and responsibilities as widely divergent as those of the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Including members of the armed forces, the Executive Branch employs more than 4 million Americans.
The President
The President is both the head of state and head of government of the United States of America, and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.
Under Article II of the Constitution, the President is responsible for the execution and enforcement of the laws created by Congress. Fifteen executive departments — each led by an appointed member of the President’s Cabinet — carry out the day-to-day administration of the federal government. They are joined in this by other executive agencies such as the CIA and Environmental Protection Agency, the heads of which are not part of the Cabinet, but who are under the full authority of the President. The President also appoints the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions, such as the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as federal judges, ambassadors, and other federal offices. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) consists of the immediate staff to the President, along with entities such as the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
The President has the power either to sign legislation into law or to veto bills enacted by Congress, although Congress may override a veto with a two-thirds vote of both houses. The Executive Branch conducts diplomacy with other nations and the President has the power to negotiate and sign treaties, which the Senate ratifies. The President can issue executive orders, which direct executive officers or clarify and further existing laws. The President also has the power to extend pardons and clemencies for federal crimes.
With these powers come several responsibilities, among them a constitutional requirement to “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” Although the President may fulfill this requirement in any way he or she chooses, Presidents have traditionally given a State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress each January (except in inaugural years) outlining their agenda for the coming year.
The Constitution lists only three qualifications for the Presidency — the President must be at least 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen, and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. And though millions of Americans vote in a presidential election every four years, the President is not, in fact, directly elected by the people. Instead, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of every fourth year, the people elect the members of the Electoral College. Apportioned by population to the 50 states — one for each member of their congressional delegation (with the District of Columbia receiving 3 votes) — these Electors then cast the votes for President. There are currently 538 electors in the Electoral College.
President Joseph R. Biden is the 46th President of the United States. He is, however, only the 45th person ever to serve as President; President Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms, and thus is recognized as both the 22nd and the 24th President. Today, the President is limited to two four-year terms, but until the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1951, a President could serve an unlimited number of terms. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected President four times, serving from 1932 until his death in 1945; he is the only President ever to have served more than two terms.
By tradition, the President and the First Family live in the White House in Washington, D.C., also the location of the President’s Oval Office and the offices of his or her senior staff. When the President travels by plane, his or her aircraft is designated Air Force One; the President may also use a Marine Corps helicopter, known as Marine One while the President is on board. For ground travel, the President uses an armored presidential limousine.
The Vice President
The primary responsibility of the Vice President of the United States is to be ready at a moment’s notice to assume the Presidency if the President is unable to perform his or her duties. This can be because of the President’s death, resignation, or temporary incapacitation, or if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet judge that the President is no longer able to discharge the duties of the presidency.
The Vice President is elected along with the President by the Electoral College. Each elector casts one vote for President and another for Vice President. Before the ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, electors only voted for President, and the person who received the second greatest number of votes became Vice President.
The Vice President also serves as the President of the United States Senate, where he or she casts the deciding vote in the case of a tie. Except in the case of tie-breaking votes, the Vice President rarely actually presides over the Senate. Instead, the Senate selects one of their own members, usually junior members of the majority party, to preside over the Senate each day.
Kamala D. Harris is the 49th Vice President of the United States. She is the first woman and first woman of color to be elected to this position. The duties of the Vice President, outside of those enumerated in the Constitution, are at the discretion of the current President. Each Vice President approaches the role differently — some take on a specific policy portfolio, others serve simply as a top adviser to the President. Of the 48 previous Vice Presidents, nine have succeeded to the Presidency, and five have been elected to the Presidency in their own right. 
The Vice President has an office in the West Wing of the White House, as well as in the nearby Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Like the President, he or she also maintains an official residence, at the United States Naval Observatory in Northwest Washington, D.C. This peaceful mansion has been the official home of the Vice President since 1974 — previously, Vice Presidents had lived in their own private residences. The Vice President also has his or her own limousine, operated by the United States Secret Service, and flies on the same aircraft the President uses — but when the Vice President is aboard, the craft are referred to as Air Force Two and Marine Two.
Executive Office of the President
Every day, the President of the United States is faced with scores of decisions, each with important consequences for America’s future. To provide the President with the support that he or she needs to govern effectively, the Executive Office of the President (EOP) was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The EOP has responsibility for tasks ranging from communicating the President’s message to the American people to promoting our trade interests abroad.
The EOP, overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, has traditionally been home to many of the President’s closest advisers. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisers, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full Presidential discretion. The individual offices that these advisors oversee have grown in size and number since the EOP was created. Some were formed by Congress, others as the President has needed them — they are constantly shifting as each President identifies his or her needs and priorities. Perhaps the most visible parts of the EOP are the White House Communications Office and Press Secretary’s Office. The Press Secretary provides daily briefings for the media on the President’s activities and agenda. Less visible to most Americans is the National Security Council, which advises the President on foreign policy, intelligence, and national security.
There are also a number of offices responsible for the practicalities of maintaining the White House and providing logistical support for the President. These include the White House Military Office, which is responsible for services ranging from Air Force One to the dining facilities, and the Office of Presidential Advance, which prepares sites remote from the White House for the President’s arrival.
Many senior advisors in the EOP work near the President in the West Wing of the White House. However, the majority of the staff is housed in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, just a few steps away and part of the White House compound.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is an advisory body made up of the heads of the 15 executive departments. Appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the members of the Cabinet are often the President’s closest confidants. In addition to running major federal agencies, they play an important role in the Presidential line of succession — after the Vice President, Speaker of the House, and Senate President pro tempore, the line of succession continues with the Cabinet offices in the order in which the departments were created. All the members of the Cabinet take the title Secretary, excepting the head of the Justice Department, who is styled Attorney General.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) develops and executes policy on farming, agriculture, and food. Its aims include meeting the needs of farmers and ranchers, promoting agricultural trade and production, assuring food safety, protecting forests and other natural resources, fostering rural prosperity, and ending hunger in America and abroad.
The USDA employs nearly 100,000 people and has an annual budget of approximately $150 billion.

Home News Testimony Written testimony of CBP for a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing titled “Securing the Border: Understanding Threats and Strategies for the Maritime Border”
Written testimony of CBP Office of Air and Marine Assistant Commissioner Randolph Alles for a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing titled “Securing the Border: Understanding Threats and Strategies for the Maritime Border”
Release Date: July 15, 2015
342 Dirksen Senate Office Building
Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished Members, it is a pleasure to appear before you today to discuss U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Air and Marine (OAM) efforts to secure our Nation’s maritime borders. OAM is a federal law enforcement organization dedicated to serving and protecting the American people.
As America’s frontline border agency, CBP is responsible for securing America’s borders against threats while facilitating the lawful flow of people and goods entering the United States. OAM is a critical component of CBP’s border security mission and the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) risk-based and multi-layered approach to homeland security. We apply advanced aeronautical and maritime capabilities and employ our unique skill sets to protect our Nation’s borders and preserve America’s security interests.
OAM’s mission falls into four broad categories that reflect our core competencies: Interdiction, Investigation, Domain Awareness, and Contingencies and National Taskings. These competencies are interdependent and complementary and leverage our expertise in the air and maritime environments. We prioritize the development of this organizational expertise throughout our recruitment and training, material acquisitions and program development, and we tailor our law enforcement capabilities and assets to our specialized mission.
A relatively small organization, OAM thrives by being extremely efficient and adaptive. Additionally OAM leverages its capabilities by empowering its operational units to forge crucial partnerships.
In the maritime environment, we operate effectively with a variety of federal, state and local partners, including frequent joint operations with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the United States Navy. Through our integration with CBP, as well as our legacy history with U.S. Customs, we enjoy a close working relationship with other investigative components within DHS, particularly U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These relationships, coupled with our broad authorities, allow OAM to follow cases wherever they lead – from the air, to the sea and on to land, or from an investigative lead to an interdiction at sea. We also frequently cooperate directly with foreign governments. In this way, OAM lends critical capabilities and cohesion to an array of border security and maritime law enforcement efforts.
One example of these efforts is a recent operation conducted by OAM Marine Interdiction Agents (MIAs) based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. After boarding and searching a sailing vessel arriving from the Bahamas, the team discovered approximately 220 pounds of cocaine concealed in a bilge area. The agents elected to pursue the investigation further, and asked the suspect if he would facilitate a “controlled delivery,” – a ruse whereby a smuggling suspect agrees to deliver the contraband as planned, but under observation by law enforcement. The suspect agreed, and the agents contacted their partners on the local Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) to help coordinate the delivery. OAM and other BEST agents completed the delivery successfully, resulting in the arrests of two suspects and the seizure of the cocaine, one sailboat, one truck, and $1650 in cash. The exploitation of the initial seizure was only possible due to the authorities and expertise of the OAM agents, and close working relationships with other investigators.
Our greatest resources are the sound judgment and experience of our agents, who average 17 years of law enforcement experience with OAM. Over 60 percent of these sworn agents are veterans of the Armed Services, and many have prior experience in law enforcement. All agents receive intensive training in applicable law, use of force, investigative techniques, Spanish language, and more upon entrance into service. Soon after, they undergo additional advanced training in tactics and the safe operation of vessels and aircraft. All agents are empowered to apply the full range of their legal authorities when conducting interdictions or investigations, in strict accordance with the law. This high level of training and experience allows us to empower our agents to make critical, real-time decisions on-scene, allowing for an informed, rapid response to exigent scenarios.
OAM is uniquely positioned – organizationally, via broad enforcement authorities and jurisdiction, and with unequaled specialized training, equipment, and domain awareness capability – to protect America’s security interests beyond the nation’s border in source and transit zones, between ports of entry, in our coastal waters, and within the nation’s interior.
A Secure Maritime Border
Thousands of vessels enter or operate in U.S. territorial sea daily. Though the vast majority do so for purposes of recreation or legitimate commerce, a small percentage engage in smuggling and other illegal activity. Apprehending these smugglers can be daunting, as many mimic legitimate traffic while others elude detection altogether.
This challenge is similar to one faced by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, as air smugglers exploited known gaps in offshore radar coverage to deliver narcotics, often by air-drop or by “popping up” inside U.S. airspace and emulating a domestic flight. The United States response in those situations included increasing air domain awareness by deploying and linking additional air surveillance radars, and increasing its coordinated response capability via air interceptors and other assets. With increased awareness and response, U.S. Customs was able to leverage a highly regulated air environment to identify evasive or non-compliant aircraft and target them for enforcement. The result was an unprecedented state of air security that persists today, with OAM maintaining air domain awareness via the functionality at the Air and Marine Operations Center (AMOC) and an air intercept capability in its present-day fleet.
A secure maritime border presents additional challenges. Unlike air traffic, small vessels1 inbound to the United States are generally not required to announce their arrivals in advance, nor are they required to make their initial landing at a designated port of entry. Additionally, small vessels have no requirement to continually broadcast their position via transponder.2 Therefore, many of the tools used to sort legitimate air traffic from the illegitimate are not available in the maritime environment.
A secure maritime border is one where there is an effective understanding of the maritime domain, with awareness of traffic moving in or toward U.S. waters, and the ability to infer intent and interdict as necessary. Achieving this state requires:
Maritime Domain Awareness – Detection capability in the form of fixed and mobile sensors, an effective distribution network, and current information that facilitates evaluation and decision-making, such as track history and projected movements.
Law Enforcement Information – Knowledge of criminal intent or practices typically gained through law enforcement activity, such as case information, confidential human sources, undercover work, covert surveillance, classified intelligence, etc.
Response Capability and Capacity – The ability to interdict quickly and effectively in the maritime domain. This is a function of personnel, equipment, training and expertise.
Unity of Effort – The various attributes of maritime security and law enforcement agencies are complimentary by design. No single entity has the capability or capacity to address all aspects of maritime security. Unfettered information sharing is critical to understanding the nature of maritime threats. Effective coordination must occur across organizational and jurisdictional lines.
Small Vessel Accountability – Increased accountability of small vessel arrivals from foreign countries and transmission of position via beacon or transponder while underway. This will dramatically improve maritime domain awareness and result in non-compliant vessels self-selecting for further investigation.
OAM believes that a secure maritime border is achievable. We are focusing our strategic planning efforts to this end, with emphasis on domain awareness, investigations, enhanced interdiction capabilities and a networked approach to coordination with our partners.

1 “Small vessels” are characterized as any watercraft, regardless of method of propulsion, less than 300 gross tons. Small vessels can include commercial fishing vessels, recreational boats and yachts, towing vessels, uninspected passenger vessels, or any other commercial vessels involved in foreign or U.S. voyages. DHS, Small Vessel Security Implementation Plan Report to the Public, January, 2001, page 1. http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/dhs-uscg-small-vessel-security-strategy-report-to-public-012011.pdf.
2 While the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) require many commercial, passenger, and commercial fishing vessels to operate with an Automatic Identification System (AIS), a tracking system to, among other things, increase maritime awareness, the requirement does not cover many small vessels.
 OAM Overview
Prior to the establishment of DHS, the assets and personnel that comprise OAM were distributed between multiple legacy agencies, including the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Border Patrol. Under DHS, these resources were consolidated and integrated into CBP to realize greater operational effectiveness and efficiencies in executing the new homeland security mission. Today, OAM operates in accordance with the Secretary’s Unity of Effort memorandum, with goals aligned to those delineated in the DHS 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, the DHS Southern Border and Approaches Campaign and CBP’s Vision and Strategy 2020.
One immediate benefit gained through the merger was consolidated aircraft maintenance. OAM integrated maintenance and logistics for its aircraft under a single contract to provide standard support across locations, improve accountability and aircraft safety, and ensure common configurations.
OAM operations are divided into three regions: the Southwest Region, the Northern Region, and the Southeast Region. Each region is split into Air and Marine Branches, and then further divided into Air and/or Marine Units. OAM also operates two unique operational entities: National Air Security Operations (NASO) and AMOC. NASO, operating out of six centers nationwide, coordinates operational activities, long-range planning and project oversight for the P-3 Long Range Tracker aircraft and unmanned aircraft system (UAS) programs. AMOC is a state-of-the-art law enforcement operations coordination and domain awareness center that conducts air and marine surveillance operations and fuses numerous sources of intelligence.
OAM’s 1,272 law enforcement personnel operate 257 aircraft, 283 vessels,2 and a sophisticated domain awareness network across the United States. These assets provide critical aerial and maritime surveillance, interdiction, and operational capability in support of OAM’s maritime border security mission. OAM continues to modernize its fleet and sensor systems to enhance our operational performance in diverse marine environments and increase our ability to adapt to the challenges of securing the maritime border and approaches to the United States.

3 OAM owns and maintains CBP’s 283 vessels, including riverine vessels that are operated by the U.S. Border Patrol.
 OAM Law Enforcement Authorities
An integral part of CBP’s border security mission, OAM agents are credentialed law enforcement officers with a broad range of authorities that enable them to transcend land, air, and sea domains and jurisdictions, providing a critical layer of continuity in enforcement efforts. First and foremost, OAM agents are sworn federal law enforcement agents. They are authorized to carry firearms, obtain and serve warrants, subpoenas and summons, make arrests for any offense committed in their presence and make felony arrests without warrant.4
Within the “customs waters”5 of the United States, or at any place within the United States, OAM agents may board a vessel for the purpose of enforcing customs law, and to use all necessary force to compel compliance.6 Additionally, OAM enforces laws on any American vessel on the high seas,7 and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act8 which concerns the trafficking of controlled substances aboard vessels in extraterritorial waters. These authorities enable OAM to extend our zone of security surrounding our maritime border and littorals of the United States.
In their capacity as CBP law enforcement agents, OAM agents also enforce immigration laws in the territorial sea, on land, and in the air. Agents within OAM have the same broad immigration authority9 as the U.S. Border Patrol; however, OAM is in the unique position to enforce this authority in the maritime environment. Similar to other investigative agencies, our agents recruit confidential sources, develop criminal cases, support prosecutors and testify in court in addition to their enforcement actions in the air, land and maritime domains.
This combination of authorities enables OAM to conduct successful investigations in the maritime domain.

 Maritime Assets and Capabilities
OAM’s unique maritime law enforcement mission requires the use of marine assets and capabilities – including fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as patrol and interdiction vessels and a sophisticated domain awareness network across the United States. OAM’s maritime assets are tailored to the conditions of the threat environment in which we operate, and equipped with the capabilities required to interdict illicit smuggling attempts of drugs and undocumented aliens.
Often, there is little time to interdict inbound suspect vessels, and OAM has honed its maritime border security response capability around rapid and effective interception, pursuit, and interdiction of these craft. OAM employs high speed Coastal Interceptor Vessels (CIV) that are specifically designed and engineered with the speed, maneuverability, integrity and endurance to intercept and engage a variety of suspect non-compliant vessels in offshore waters, as well as the Great Lakes on the northern border.
Our vessels are manned by highly trained and experienced OAM crews authorized to deploy any required use of force, including warning shots and disabling fire to stop fleeing vessels. Over the last decade, OAM has evolved to counter the egregious threat of non-compliant vessels. OAM has developed capabilities to disable non-compliant vessels and to bring dangerous pursuits to a conclusion and prevent these vessels from reaching our shores. Since 2003, OAM has engaged in 123 cases involving marine warning and/or disabling rounds, and three cases involving air to vessel warning and disabling rounds.
OAM often works in partnership with ICE-HSI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducting covert operations in the maritime border environment; utilizing unmarked and undercover vessels when situations dictate that the surveillance of drug loads or transnational criminal organization (TCO) activity can yield larger seizures as a part of ongoing investigations. Some of these covert missions involve OAM agents facilitating controlled deliveries with partner agencies through the utilization of undercover vessels and the incorporation of undercover or plainclothes agents. OAM has a number of unmarked vessels typical to local traffic, which are used for this purpose.
OAM specializes in the installation of covert trackers aboard suspect vessels and often conducts these covert missions under hours of darkness using plainclothes or undercover tactics. Additionally, OAM periodically augments vessel crews from investigative partner agencies when a specific vessel certification coupled with investigative authority and experience is needed when operating these assets. OAM develops and retains confidential human sources in the maritime environment, which have been instrumental in effecting significant seizures.
Although OAM routinely makes seizures through maritime border patrols, the majority of arrests and seizures are the result of actionable information or detection by aircraft. CBP’s P-3 Long Range Tracker and Airborne Early Warning aircraft are multirole high endurance aircraft capable of performing border security mission sets in the air and maritime environments. Equipped with a multitude of highly sophisticated communications equipment, radar and imagery sensors, operated by highly trained professional sworn law enforcement agents and officers, the P-3 is accredited with the interdiction of 122,427 pounds of cocaine and 5,918 flight hours within the Western Hemisphere Transit Zones in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, which equated to 20.7 pounds of narcotics interdicted per flight hour.
The integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have provided critical enhancements to OAM’s air, land, and maritime border domain awareness and capabilities. UAS provide high-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance of land borders, inland waters, littoral waters, and high seas with multiple advanced sensor arrays. The use of UAS in the maritime environment has increased OAM’s ability to effectively detect, monitor, and track both personnel and conveyances involved in illegal activity.
Another important maritime security asset is the DHC-8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA). It is a medium-range airplane that bridges the gap between the strategic P-3 and UAS, and smaller aircraft operating in the littoral waters. It is outfitted specifically for maritime patrol with state-of-the art sensors and systems. The DHC-8 has provided game-changing detection capability in the Caribbean, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.
CBP’s aerial surveillance capabilities in the maritime environment have been enhanced through recent investments and deployments of a Multi-Role Enforcement Aircraft (MEA). The MEA provides OAM a replacement for several of its older maritime patrol aircraft, enhancing OAM's ability to maintain domain awareness of the U.S. littorals and coastline. Additionally, the multi-role function of the aircraft provides OAM agents the ability to continue investigations seamlessly into the interior of the United States, landing at small remote airports to interdict suspected air smugglers. OAM’s Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS)10 is an effective surveillance asset providing radar detection and monitoring of low-altitude aircraft and surface vessels along the U.S.-Mexico border, the Florida Straits, and a portion of the Caribbean. With eight aerostat sites – six along the Southwest border, one in the Florida Keys, and one in Puerto Rico – the TARS elevated sensor mitigates the effect of the curvature of the earth and terrain-masking limitations associated with ground-based radars, greatly increasing long-range radar detection capabilities. The eight TARS sites represent approximately two percent of the total radars integrated by OAM, yet they account for over 50 percent of all suspect target detections.
Perhaps the most important advancements come in the area of data integration and exploitation. Downlink technology, paired with the BigPipe system, allows OAM to provide video feed and situational awareness in real-time. In addition, the Minotaur mission integration system will allow multiple aircraft and vessels to share networked information, providing a never before seen level of air, land, and sea domain awareness.
A vital component of DHS’s domain awareness capabilities, the AMOC integrates multiple sensor technologies and sources of information to provide comprehensive domain awareness in support of CBP’s border security mission. Utilizing extensive law enforcement and intelligence databases and communication networks, AMOC’s operational system, the Air and Marine Operations Surveillance System (AMOSS), provides a single display that is capable of processing up to 700 individual sensor feeds and tracking over 50,000 individual targets simultaneously.
AMOC coordinates with the Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and international law enforcement partners in the governments of Mexico (GoM), Canada, and the Bahamas, to detect, identify, track and support interdiction of suspect aviation and maritime activity in the approaches to U.S. borders, at the borders, and within the interior of the United States. This relationship, enhanced through the deployment of shared surveillance technology has allowed GoM to focus aviation and maritime enforcement efforts to better combat transnational criminal organization (TCO) operations in Northern Mexico and the contiguous U.S./Mexico border. For example, this past January, officers working at the AMOC detected a suspicious aircraft travelling north towards the United States. AMOC subsequently alerted GoM, via the AMOSS, of the activity, and both the Mexican Federal Police (PF) and Air Force (SEDENA) responded to investigate. The abandoned aircraft was located by Mexican officials a short time later, where 27 bags containing approximately 389 kilos methamphetamine, 79 kilos of cocaine, 79 kilos of white heroin, and 1.5 kilos of black tar heroin were discovered and seized.

10 CBP assumed responsibility of TARS from the U.S. Air Force in 2013, but the aerostat surveillance system had been used by the Department of Defense since 1978.
 Operational Coordination
Secretary Johnson’s Unity of Effort initiative has put in place new and strengthened management processes to enable more effective DHS component operations. In addition, DHS-wide border and maritime security activities are being strategically guided by the new Southern Border and Approaches Campaign. Aimed at leveraging the range of unique Department roles, responsibilities, and capabilities, the Campaign enhances our operational approach to working together in a more unified way to address comprehensive threat environments. OAM has been extensively involved in the planning and development of all Joint Task Forces, particularly Joint Task Force – East (JTF-E), where OAM holds the Deputy Director position. Working closely with the USCG, ICE and others, we have played a key role in developing the Concept of Operations, the DHS Force Management plan and led the critical Mission Analysis planning efforts, which are all vital to meet the objectives outlined in the SBACP. OAM will continue to invest in and fully support the Joint Task Forces and looks forward to playing a key role in the unity of effort outlined by the Secretary in the SBACP.
In 2011, the CBP Commissioner, the USCG Commandant and ICE Assistant Secretary signed the cross-component Maritime Operations Coordination (MOC) plan. The plan addresses the unique nature of the maritime environment and sets forth a layered, DHS-wide approach to homeland security issues within the maritime domain, ensuring integrated planning, information sharing, and increased response capability in each area of responsibility. In accordance with the MOC plan, OAM has been a key stakeholder in the implementation of the Regional Coordinating Mechanism (RECOM). Through this mechanism, OAM coordinates maritime operational activities through integrated planning, information sharing and intelligence integration.
OAM agents participate in ICE HSI-led BEST task forces across the nation. This practice has multiple benefits. OAM agents provide maritime law enforcement expertise and ready access to OAM assets and capabilities. In turn, information shared through the BEST refines OAM operations and enables more targeted enforcement. OAM recently became a member of the BEST in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Working in conjunction with the San Juan BEST, OAM operations have yielded 24 arrests, 1,453 pounds of narcotics and $948,953 in currency over the current fiscal year.
CBP OAM is the largest aviation contributor to the Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S), and is an integral part to their aviation capability and success to counter illicit trafficking within the maritime environment. P-3s patrol in a 42 million square mile area that includes more than 41 nations, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and maritime approaches to the United States.
Joint Technology Development
OAM has identified Domain Awareness as a core competency and an essential element of a secure border. To that end, we will fully-network our fleet and centers to share critical information in real time. We are pursuing that vision through joint efforts with technological partners.
OAM is engaged with the USCG and DoD to identify and deploy technologies that expand overall maritime domain awareness and integrates information and sensor data throughout DoD and DHS. AMOC has begun to integrate data from airborne DOD assets and seeks to expand further into the maritime domain. With the support of DHS S&T and the USCG Research and Development Center, prototype technologies such as the Integrated Maritime Domain Enterprise have been deployed to the AMOC, USCG Sectors San Diego and Los Angeles/Long Beach, and are currently under evaluation. This network is being developed to manage and coherently integrate maritime sensors and data sources, such as Minotaur and the Coastal Surveillance System, into a user defined operating picture, which can be then shared between stakeholders.
OAM works closely with the Science & Technology Directorate (S&T) to identify and develop technology to improve our maritime surveillance and detection capabilities, including low-flying aircraft detection and tracking systems and data integration/data fusion capabilities. Currently under development is Coalition Tactical Awareness and Response (CTAR), a space-based system which can be used tactically against maritime threats. OAM is also working with the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) to develop and field radiological and nuclear (R/N) detection and nuclear forensics systems. For example, DNDO and OAM are collaborating in the development of technology to detect R/N threats aboard small vessels.
Indicators of Success
OAM efforts have resulted in the seizure of significant quantities of contraband, and disrupted considerable illicit activity before it reaches our shores.
In FY 2014, OAM conducted 90,739 flight hours and 42,859 underway hours, resulting in the arrest of 4,725 suspects, the apprehension of more than 79,672 illegal migrants, the seizure of 763 weapons, $147,805,097 in currency, and the interdiction of more than 1,155,815 pounds of illegal drugs, including 155,143 pounds of cocaine.
OAM recognizes the need for relevant, verifiable performance measures that point towards outcomes as well as output, and has initiated an effort to develop them. This is a new process for us. We have engaged a federally-funded research and development center to assist in developing metrics particular to domain awareness. We plan to refine a methodology for developing such measures, and apply it to operations across our organization.
Conclusion
Chairwoman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to testify today. OAM is a critical component of CBP’s border security mission. Our highly-trained agents, together with our authorities, specialized assets, and tactics comprise a well-rounded, experienced and established law enforcement organization, fully engaged in protecting the United States’ maritime borders from threats to the homeland.
I look forward to answering any questions you may have at this time.

Frequently Asked Questions
Printable FAQs
What are your inspectors looking for?
Our inspectors check vehicles and commodities for compliance with California and federal plant quarantine regulations. They also check commodities to make sure they are free from exotic invasive species that may be hitchhiking with them. Although the primary focus is on plant materials (i.e., fruits, vegetables, nursery stock, hay, firewood, etc.), other items are also frequently inspected.
What Legal Authority do your inspectors have to stop and check my vehicle?
The Department’s legal authority for conducting vehicle and commodity inspections lies in the California Food and Agricultural Code, specifically Sections 5341-5353 and 6301-6465. Although submitting to inspection is voluntary, vehicle and commodities are not allowed to enter until released by an inspector.
What are some vehicles inspected more thoroughly than others?
To minimize delays at the border (with nearly 20 million vehicles passing through the border stations each year), our inspectors are trained to conduct their inspections by the risk that a vehicle may be carrying hitchhiking pests in it—the higher the risk, the more thorough the inspection. This assessment is based on several factors, including route of travel, time of year and vehicle type.
Do this inspections really work
Yes! Studies show a direct correlation between agricultural inspections and lowering invasive species infestations. One study indicates that for every dollar spent on pest prevention, $14 are saved in later control costs and economic losses.
What can I do to avoid delays at the border?
Have all plant material—including fruits, vegetables, plants, hay, and firewood—packed for easy access.
Ensure the driver knows what is in the vehicle and where it is packed.
Ensure the driver has keys or knows the combination for all door locks.
Ensure all doors (especially those of self-mover trucks and trailers) can be easily opened and closed.
Can I bring Pets into California?
There are no restrictions for bringing dogs and cats into California (if bringing a dog, you are encouraged to carry proof of rabies vaccination). However, under California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) regulations, certain exotic animals are restricted and may not be transported or possessed in California without a permit. These regulations are designed to keep non-native animal species from becoming established in the State and to ensure exotic animals in captivity are properly cared for. In a cooperative effort, these regulations are enforced at our border stations. The most common restricted species encountered at our stations are: Ferrets, gerbils, hedgehogs, Quaker or Monk Parrots, and sugar gliders. Visit the California Department of Fish and Wildlife Website for information on wildlife that are exotic or not native to California or may be considered a nuisance at times.
For more information or to apply for restricted species permits, contact the CDFW License and Revenue Branch at 916-928-5846.
What do I need to bring livestock into the state?
Border station inspectors record the movement of all livestock into California. When you arrive at the station with livestock, you will be asked to provide information on the owner, origin, destination address, species, and number of animals. You should also present any health or brand certificates you have for the animals. This information is forwarded to the CDFA Animal Health Division for tracking and regulatory enforcement. For more information on livestock entry requirements, visit the CDFA Animal Health Division Website or phone (916) 900-5052.
Are there any restrictions for bringing firewood into the state
Like all plant material, firewood is subject to inspection for insects and disease symptoms when it arrives at our border stations—if insects or disease symptoms are found, the wood may be rejected. Because of the high likelihood of wood-boring insects being present in all shipments of firewood, travelers are strongly discouraged from moving firewood out of the local area from where it was cut. For more information visit: www.dontmovefirewood.org.
Additionally, several federal and state plant quarantine regulations prohibit or restrict the movement of firewood. These include the:
Chestnut Bark Disease and Oak Wild Disease State Exterior Quarantine
Spongy Moth Federal Quarantine
Pine Shoot Beetle Federal Quarantine
Asian Longhorned Beetle Federal Quarantine
Emerald Ash Borer Federal Quarantine
Why do you Inspect Boats and other Watercraft?
Protecting California against aquatic invasive species, such as quagga and zebra mussels is an important part of our job. These mussels easily hitchhike on boats and are spread by unsuspecting boat owners. They are extremely invasive and disruptive to aquatic ecosystems, and post a great economic threat to water delivery systems for our cities and agriculture. For more information visit: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Invasives/Quagga-Mussels.
Can I bring Hay into California
In general, there are not specific restrictions on bringing hay into California; however, it must be free from noxious weeds and insect pests and is subject to inspection upon arrival at our border stations. If bringing hay, be sure it is loaded so the outer surface of the bales can be easily seen. Most hay passes inspection, but occasionally pests are found and the shipment is rejected. In this event, you may need to return the hay out-of-state if it cannot be easily disposed of at the station.
Will I be inspected when I leave california
While there aren’t any inspection stations leaving California, all states do have plant quarantine regulations that must be complied with to prevent the spread of exotic pests. When moving plant material out of California, it is highly recommended that you contact the state plant health regulatory official’s office in the state you are traveling to and inquire if there are any restrictions. Contact information may be found by visiting the National Plant Board Website.
I found a new or unusual plant or pest in my neighborhood, What should I do?
Contact your local county agriculture department and inform them that you wish to report a pest sighting or call theCDFA Pest Hotline at 1-800-491-1899. For more information visit the CDFA Report a Pest Website.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Overview
The federal government processed 362 million citizen and noncitizen travelers through U.S. ports of entry in fiscal year 20131—more than 242 million people by land, 102 million by air, and 18 million by sea.2 That year, authorities apprehended some 421,000 people trying to enter the country illegally outside those official ports.3
Border security is primarily a federal responsibility and involves managing the legal flow, and preventing the illegal entry, of people and goods into the United States. In recent years, though, state and local authorities increasingly have collaborated with federal agencies on immigration-related efforts at the nation’s borders. This brief explores the federal, state, and local work in enforcing immigration laws at those borders and ports of entry. The Pew Charitable Trusts addressed similar issues in the country’s interior in a July 2014 brief, “Immigration Enforcement Within the Nation’s Borders.”
In discussions of immigration and border security, attention often focuses on the 1,954-mile land border between the United States and Mexico. Yet the federal agencies involved in immigration enforcement have personnel and operations at other U.S. borders and at ports of entry in all 50 states. Over the past two decades, increased federal funding for border security has meant more facilities, equipment, and personnel devoted to this mission. Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003, funding for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that manages the nation’s borders, has risen from $6.6 billion4 to $12.4 billion in fiscal 20145—in real terms, a 91 percent increase.
There also have been expanded attempts to coordinate activities with state and local law enforcement. Although no nationwide program of border cooperation exists, pockets of activity and examples of collaboration are evident along land borders. Over the past decade, partnerships, programs, offices, and task forces have been started to share information and coordinate law enforcement efforts among various levels of government.
The relationship between states and the federal government received heightened national attention in 2014 as some states put additional resources into border enforcement in response to an increasing number of unaccompanied children illegally crossing the southwestern border. In July, for example, Texas sent 1,000 members of the National Guard to its border with Mexico to reinforce federal efforts.
Though federal agency operations span many border security missions, including protecting the nation from terrorism, illegal drugs, and the unlawful entry of goods, this brief focuses only on the entry of people. The figures presented here on staffing and funding include roles beyond that mission, however, because it is often not possible to isolate resources dedicated to specific activities.
This brief is not meant to be an exhaustive accounting of federal and intergovernmental activities at the border and ports of entry. Instead, it provides examples demonstrating that border security is, in reality, occurring not just at the land borders with Mexico and Canada, but all across the United States, and that there are places where different levels of government are collaborating to address security concerns. Understanding the geographic breadth of these efforts can give policymakers a broader and more complete picture of immigration-related border enforcement activities.
Pew takes no position on federal, state, or local laws or policies related to immigration.
Defining the Border
The definition of the border for federal immigration enforcement purposes is broad. Activities take place along international land boundaries. Border enforcement also takes place at many seaports and along the coastline. Related maritime operations occur along the northern border on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway, and around U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico.
In addition, border enforcement exists well inside the United States at international airports and up to 100 miles inside the physical border with Mexico or Canada, where U.S. Customs and Border Protection has the authority to operate checkpoints and transportation checks.
Key federal agencies and personnel
Many federal agencies have a presence across the states in enforcing immigration laws at the borders and at ports of entry. DHS and the Department of Justice are the key federal actors in immigration-related border security, but other federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense, play more limited roles. These agencies often work together and at times cooperate with state and local governments.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
DHS houses three agencies involved in immigration-related border management: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Although headquartered in Washington, each has personnel and other assets throughout the states.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary federal agency responsible for protecting the country’s borders and enforcing laws dealing with the entry and exit of citizens and noncitizens. The agency has three main operational offices:
Field Operations is tasked with immigration enforcement and security at all designated land, air, and sea ports of entry, including screening entrants at these ports. In fiscal 2014, this unit had 25,775 total active duty officers located across all 50 states and the U.S. territories.6
Border Patrol does not operate at land ports of entry but does apprehend individuals who cross the border without authorization between these ports. It maintains and monitors border fencing, patrols land borders, operates land-based surveillance equipment, and conducts search and rescue missions, among other duties. The agency is organized into 20 sectors that cover all 50 states. (See Figure 2.) The number of Border Patrol agents has grown from 10,717 in fiscal 2003 to 21,391 in fiscal 2013—a 99 percent increase.7 It has been especially notable along the southwestern border. Still, the northern border also saw a gain in agents, from 569 in fiscal 20038 to 2,212 in fiscal 2014.9 (See Figure 1.)
Air and Marine Interdiction agents monitor land and sea borders by aircraft and boat, as well as with surveillance equipment. In fiscal 2013, there were 1,138 Interdiction agents.10
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations division serves as the primary investigative agency for immigration-related crimes, such as smuggling and trafficking.11 The division also transports short-term detainees from CBP’s facilities along the border to long-term detention centers, and it sends Mexican nationals who crossed the border without authorization to the interior of Mexico.
U.S. Coast Guard coordinates with other federal agencies to patrol and ensure the security of ports, waterways, and U.S. coastal territories.12 As part of this mission, it can interdict unauthorized migrants attempting to illegally enter the United States or being smuggled into the country by way of a maritime route.13
Working With Communities
The Customs and Border Protection State, Local, and Tribal Liaison Office is headquartered in Washington, though each of the nation’s 20 Border Patrol sectors has liaison staff that interact with officials from state, local, and tribal governments. The liaison offices work to communicate directly with communities through meetings with local leaders, stakeholders, and the public.*
* U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “State, Local, Tribal Liaison Office,” http://www.cbp.gov/about/state-local-tribal-resources.
U.S. Department of Justice
Several agencies within the Department of Justice perform border enforcement activities related to immigration:
Executive Office for Immigration Review operates immigration courts that cover a wide array of proceedings and hearings for both legal and unauthorized immigrants. For certain people apprehended at the border for illegally entering the country, these immigration judges determine whether they will be removed from the United States.
The FBI maintains criminal databases used for migrant background checks and the identification of suspected terrorists.14
U.S. Marshals Service jointly manages the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System with ICE. This program moves unauthorized immigrants charged with crimes and apprehended at the border or a designated port of entry from short-term holding facilities operated by CBP to long-term detention facilities operated by ICE, as well as between criminal courts and detention facilities. In some cases, marshals are responsible for transporting migrants back to their countries of origin.15
U.S. Department of Defense
The Department of Defense plays a supporting role in border security, funding the National Guard when it is deployed by the federal government to aid border patrol operations16 and providing additional security equipment.17 Members of the Guard can assist federal agents but do not have the authority to apprehend or arrest migrants.
Major border security facilities related to immigration
Border security facilities include vehicle checkpoint lanes on the border, international arrivals terminals in airports, and offices housing immigration and border security personnel nationwide. They include official entry points into the United States, supply and shelter outposts for agents, and regional operations headquarters for staff. Immigration and border security infrastructure encompasses land, air, and sea operations and is present in all 50 states.
Ports of entry are locations where people legally enter or leave the country by land, air, or sea. Activities that take place at these ports include admitting immigrants and visitors, accepting merchandise, collecting duties, and enforcing U.S. import and export laws and regulations. In 2014, there were 314 ports of entry in the states and 13 in the territories of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (See Figure 4.)18
Border Patrol stations provide offices for Border Patrol agents but also serve as short-term holding facilities for migrants apprehended at the border. Most are 24-hour facilities either leased or owned by the federal General Services Administration. As of March 2014, there were 136 stations across the 20 sectors. (See Figure 2.)19
Forward operating bases are tactical support offices in areas between Border Patrol stations that are strategically placed near the areas of highest unlawful entry, smuggling, and trafficking at the northern and southwestern borders. These bases can temporarily house migrants apprehended at the borders, as well as store supplies and communications equipment for agents in isolated patrol areas. As of March 2014, there were 12 forward operating bases in seven of the Border Patrol sectors. (See Figure 3.)20
Permanent checkpoints for traffic are located on major routes along the southwestern and northern borders, with Border Patrol agents stationed to apprehend unauthorized individuals who cross the border. As of March 2014, there were 35 permanent checkpoints operating around the clock in nine of 20 Border Patrol sectors. (See Figure 3.)21 Border Patrol agents also use temporary checkpoints and conduct transportation checks within 100 miles of U.S. land borders to identify and apprehend individuals who crossed the border without authorization.
Field Operations offices support Field Operations officers’ work at various ports of entry. As of June 2014, there were 19 such offices. (See Figure 4.)22
Air and Marine branch offices are regional headquarters for CBP’s Office of Air and Marine and provide aviation and coastal support to federal, state, and local law enforcement along land and sea borders. As of 2014, there were 22 of these offices in 11 states (Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Montana, New York, North Dakota, Texas, and Washington) and the District of Columbia.23
Air and Marine Operations Center, located in Riverside, California, is operated by CBP. Created in 1988, this is a federal intelligence-gathering hub that monitors suspicious aviation and maritime activities through surveillance technology.24
National Air Security Operations Centers are CBP aircraft hubs in six cities (Albuquerque, New Mexico; Corpus Christi, Texas; Grand Forks, North Dakota; Jacksonville, Florida; Sierra Vista, Arizona; and the District of Columbia) that deploy agents and unmanned aircraft for surveillance missions.25
The Southwestern States and Border Enforcement
The four states along the U.S. border with Mexico—Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas— maintain a strong interest in all activities on the border, including immigration enforcement. Each has actively cooperated with the federal government and has devoted additional funding and resources to border enforcement. For example, in 2006, they all signed memorandums of agreement with the federal government to allow National Guard personnel to support federal efforts along the border as part of Operation Jump Start.*
Since 2005, Texas has supplemented federal border security efforts with state resources and funding. In October of that year, the governor announced a border security plan to support local law enforcement and provide additional resources to combat terrorism, illegal drug trafficking, and gangs.† Since then, a series of state and federally funded programs, including Operation Linebacker‡ and Operation Border Star,§ have been launched to deter illegal immigration, combat border crime, and coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement efforts. In July 2014, the governor of Texas ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to the border in response to the influx of unaccompanied children attempting to cross into the United States.¶
In 2010, the governor of Arizona announced a border security plan that included $10 million of discretionary federal stimulus grant money to support local law enforcement.** The plan included National Guard reconnaissance, aerial patrolling, and military exercises, as well as increased support for local law enforcement and enhanced cooperation with federal agencies. In 2011, the governor signed a law allowing the state to build a fence along the border on private, state, or federal property.††

Examples of collaboration along the border
Federal border security agencies often partner with other federal entities, as well as with states and localities, to enhance information sharing and provide immigration enforcement officers at the border. There is no complete listing of these joint programs and partnerships,26 but among the examples:
The El Paso Intelligence Center, originally established in 1974,27 is administered jointly by CBP and the Drug Enforcement Administration. It coordinates the intelligence functions of multiple federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to support activities along the southwestern border, including efforts to stop migrant smuggling.28
The Joint Field Command is a CBP office in Tucson, Arizona, that provides a central point of contact for operations of all CBP components in the state. The office collaborates with state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to share intelligence and leverage cooperation.29
The Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats is a federal program that works with more than 60 federal, state, tribal, and Mexican law enforcement agencies to disrupt and interdict criminal enterprises and individuals. It conducts criminal background checks to help apprehend individuals who cross the border unlawfully.30 Located in Arizona, the alliance includes state and local agents, county attorneys’ offices, city police departments, and the Arizona National Guard.31 A similar program spans New Mexico and 17 counties in West Texas.32
Border Enforcement Security Task Forces are partnerships among federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies that focus on combating transnational crime, including human trafficking and smuggling.33 In 2014, 35 task forces in 16 states were managed by multiple federal agencies, including personnel from ICE; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the FBI; the U.S. Coast Guard; and U.S. attorney’s offices.34
Infrastructure and Equipment Along the Border
The border fence covers 651 miles of the 1,954-mile land border between the United States and Mexico.* In early 2013, it included 352 miles of fencing aimed at deterring pedestrians and 299 miles of vehicle barriers. Thirty-six miles of the primary fence are reinforced with secondary, or double-layer, fencing.† In addition to fencing, surveillance tools and equipment used for border enforcement include observation tower systems, cameras, motion detectors, thermal imaging sensors, stadium lighting, remote video and mobile surveillance systems, hand-held communications equipment, unattended ground sensors,‡ unmanned aerial vehicles, and blimps.§

A Federal Border Security Program and State Driver’s Licenses
The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, was fully implemented in 2009 and requires U.S. citizens entering or exiting the country through the U.S.-Canada border to present passports, passport cards, or what are known as Trusted Traveler Program cards. Previously, they could simply declare their citizenship verbally. As part of the initiative, state driver’s licenses can be used to cross the border if they meet the law’s security requirements. Among those are vicinity radio frequency identification capability, which allows for authorized readers to receive certain information from a distance via a wireless device or tag.* As of December 2014, Michigan, Washington, Vermont, and New York issued licenses that meet the requirements of the program.†

Federal Funding for the States
Operation Stonegarden is a federal grant program operated under the Federal Emergency Management Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security. In fiscal 2014, the federal government allocated $55 million for Operation Stonegarden to provide state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies with funding to enhance border security operations. For example, Texas’ Hidalgo County, which shares a long land border with Mexico, received $3.3 million in 2014 for policing activities.*
* Karen Antonacci, “Hidalgo County Cops Get $3.3M for Border Policing,” The Monitor, June 4, 2014, http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/hidalgo-county-cops-get-m-for-border-policing/article_b16c5304-ec9f-11e3-b2e7-001a4bcf6878.html.
Conclusion
Immigration enforcement activities at the nation’s borders and ports of entry are conducted with offices, personnel, and infrastructure spread throughout the entire United States, not just at the physical borders. Although there are specific examples of information and intelligence sharing and security partnerships among federal agencies and state and local law enforcement, no standardized, nationwide programs exist. The examples of cooperation tend to be clustered along the states that share the land border with Mexico and Canada. Policymakers at all levels of government should be aware that federal operations, personnel, and resources for border enforcement extend beyond the border and may provide opportunities for new forms of collaboration.

for a Hearing before the
U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security titled,
“Failure By Design: Examining Secretary Mayorkas’ Border Crisis.”
March 15, 2023, McAllen, TX
Introduction
Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the U.S. Border Patrol’s (USBP) critical operations at the Southwest Border. I am honored to appear today and represent the dedicated and talented men and women of USBP. As an operational component of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), USBP is committed to enforcing the nation’s laws, protecting our national security, keeping dangerous drugs and people from crossing our borders, and providing safe and humane conditions for those in our custody.
Since 1924, USBP has been entrusted with protecting the American people and promoting economic prosperity through our border and national security mission. Despite the myriad threats that we have confronted throughout our history, including smuggling, irregular migration, and terrorism, we continually learn, evolve, and mature to ensure excellence in protecting the homeland with professionalism while maintaining public trust.
  Current State of the Border
Evolving global and regional events continue to produce challenging conditions and trends along the Southwest Border that directly affect USBP’s border security operations. Most notably, we continue to respond to elevated levels of migrant encounters and adapt to changing migrant demographics, while also addressing the ongoing and dynamic threat of transnational criminal organizations (TCOs).
Historically, most migrants USBP encountered were from Mexico and northern Central America. However, dynamic conditions along the Southwest Border indicate a changing demographic, one in which individuals and family units are migrating from countries much farther away.
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2022, USBP encountered 2,214,652 migrants from 174 countries. In FY 2023 to date,[1] USBP encountered 770,175 migrants from 142 countries.
USBP is committed to the safe and humane processing of all encountered migrants while also preventing the entry of illegal drugs and dangerous persons. In FY 2022, USBP intercepted and seized 111,737 pounds of illegal drugs, including 18,348 pounds of methamphetamine, 12,469 pounds of cocaine, and 2,207 pounds of fentanyl.[2] USBP also encountered 12,028 subjects who had records of criminal histories, including 62 with homicide or manslaughter convictions and 365 with sexual offense convictions. We have ensured, and continue to ensure, that before any individual is released from USBP custody, he or she is vetted and screened and is determined not to pose a public safety or national security risk.
Increased numbers of migrants in USBP custody, combined with migrant demographics that make it more difficult to remove them from the United States due to complicated diplomatic relations with the country of removal, have led to logistical and operational challenges, especially concerning capacity constraints and care of migrants in processing facilities. However, USBP continues to work with our partners to help ensure efficient processing of all migrants in our custody.
While irregular migration levels have remained elevated for several years, there has been a marked decrease since the announcement of new border enforcement measures in January 2023.
Following the January 5, 2023, implementation of the new parole processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and expansion of the process for Venezuelans announced in October 2022, overall encounters of migrants at the Southwest border declined. USBP encounters of individuals who entered the country between ports of entry at the Southwest Border in January 2023 totaled 128,410, down 42 percent from 221,675 in December 2022. This is the lowest monthly amount of USBP encounters since February 2021, when encounters began to increase following the severe impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on migration. Encounters have remained at similarly low levels in February.
USBP’s ability to manage migrant flow has vastly improved through investments in personnel, facilities, processing efficiencies, and technological improvements. USBP also draws on past experience with migrant surges and other challenges as it plans for and adapts to emerging conditions to ensure we can remain focused on our border security mission.
  Improving Processing Capabilities
Once the Title 42 public health order ultimately ends, USBP will continue to use its full range of immigration authorities under Title 8 of the U.S. Code to process migrants encountered at the border, as we have done throughout our agency’s history. Under Title 8, noncitizens who enter the United States without authorization are placed into appropriate immigration proceedings, including expedited removal or proceedings before an immigration judge where they may make a claim for asylum or other protection.
USBP has accelerated ongoing efforts to improve processing operations by deploying additional non-uniformed support personnel; expanding capacity and improving conditions at processing facilities; investing in virtual and mobile processing technologies; and strengthening coordination with partner agencies and organizations. These initiatives expand USBP’s capabilities and streamline operations to ensure the safe and humane processing of migrants while also relieving agents of non-enforcement duties.
  Increasing Non-Uniformed Support Personnel
USBP deployed the first class of Border Patrol Processing Coordinators (BPPCs) in April 2021 to better meet the demands of processing noncitizens. BPPCs support Border Patrol agents with humanitarian care and intake processing of noncitizens and provide administrative and logistical support related to data entry and filing, personal property management, transportation, and welfare checks. These BPPCs have allowed agents to return to field work more quickly. To date, USBP has 961 BPPCs on board with more finalizing training and deployment. We have also expanded the use of contract personnel along the Southwest Border to include 429 contract security personnel for the Centralized Processing Centers (CPCs) and 565 contracted processors to handle data entry and management tasks; another 376 are pending deployment.
  Expanding Facilities and Services
USBP continues to increase facility capacity and add short-term facilities at key border locations to reduce over-crowding and accommodate varying demographics of migrants encountered crossing the Southwest Border. CBP reopened the Rio Grande Valley CPC in McAllen, Texas, in March 2022 after extensive renovations which dramatically improved CBP’s ability to process migrants encountered at the border in a safe, orderly, and humane manner.
Additionally, CBP announced the opening of a new soft-sided facility in El Paso, Texas, on January 11, 2023, which provides additional processing capacity for USBP’s El Paso Sector. The facility is weatherproof, climate-controlled, and provides ample areas for eating, sleeping, and personal hygiene. Another soft-sided facility opened in the San Diego Sector on January 31. The new soft-sided facilities include wrap around service contracts that provide sanitation, janitorial, food, and medical services necessary to ensure appropriate conditions for migrants and USBP personnel.
The renovation of the McAllen CPC and opening of new soft-sided facilities are part of CBP’s broader goal to safely process individuals CBP encounters, as well as increase capacity and improve facility conditions for migrants, agents, officers, and processing coordinators. We are also maximizing the use of air and ground transportation to move migrants from USBP Sectors that are over capacity to other less impacted CBP locations.
  Investing in Virtual and Mobile Processing Technologies
Working with our partners, USBP is mobilizing and shifting personnel in anticipation of potential migration surges at the Southwest Border, providing resources to areas with the most need. USBP is also investing in virtual and mobile processing technologies that are making processing functions more efficient, allowing USBP to enlist the support of agents outside the Southwest Border region without requiring them to be physically present.
A key aspect of USBP’s efforts to streamline processing operations is the Electronic Alien File (commonly referred to as an “A-File”). The initiative to make the A-File electronic will enable CBP, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to share and maintain a single file in a digital environment. USBP recently completed the first phase of its implementation of the end-to-end digital A-file for subjects processed for a Notice to Appear (NTA). Based on the success of the first phase, USBP is planning to continue implementation of the fully digital A-file for the NTA disposition nationwide in the coming months and to expand this capability to additional processes in the future. This transition will modernize USBP operations and lead to fully digital subject processing.
CBP will also increase access to, and promote use of, the Unified Immigration Portal (UIP), a centralized location where relevant immigration-related data from multiple agencies involved in the immigration process can be accessed. The platform delivers mission-critical information to users through dashboards, services, and data integration capabilities, facilitating expeditious processing of subjects and increasing visibility for interagency operations during surges.
  Coordinating with Partners
Although a critical component, the USBP is only one part of the larger border security enterprise, and collaboration with our partners—foreign and domestic—multiplies the effectiveness of our border security. It is our responsibility to ensure we coordinate, as appropriate, operations with our partners to maximize their impact, while avoiding unnecessary disruptions or conflicts.
While the current border challenges are unprecedented in many ways, so too are the collaboration and joint efforts to address changing border conditions. USBP is a key component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-led strategy to ensure a comprehensive and deliberative response to current and emerging conditions along our Southwest Border. The strategy involves surging resources; increasing efficiency to reduce strain on the border; employing an aggressive consequence regime; coordinating with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in conjunction with state and local partners; targeting cartels and smugglers; and working with our regional partners. USBP is a key partner agency in DHS’s Border Enforcement Security Task Force, which seeks to eliminate the barriers between federal and local investigations, close the gap with international partners in multinational criminal investigations, and create an environment that minimizes the vulnerabilities in our operations that TCOs have traditionally capitalized on to exploit our nation’s land and sea borders. This comprehensive plan leverages a whole-of-government approach to prepare for and manage the current level and possible future increases in encounters of migrants at our Southwest Border.
USBP will continue to work with the DHS Southwest Border Coordination Center’s Movement Coordination Cell (MCC), a standing interagency group charged with overseeing expedited processing and transfer of unaccompanied children and other vulnerable individuals out of CBP custody. The MCC, comprised of DHS personnel from CBP and ICE, as well as personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement, was formed to facilitate communication and problem-solving among U.S. government agencies to specifically address the flow of vulnerable populations. In addition, USBP appreciates critical ground and aviation support capabilities provided by the Department of Defense for detection and monitoring at the Southwest Border.
CBP is also communicating with various NGOs, including a range of non-profit organizations, faith-based entities, and others — both at and away from the border — regarding appropriate care and transportation of migrants released from custody. Furthermore, we continue to work closely with foreign governments to conduct joint enforcement operations.
  Strengthening Border Enforcement
In anticipation of increased migrant encounters, USBP is focused on ensuring other security measures and enforcement programs are not circumvented or compromised by the response to emerging events. USBP’s deployment of resources and technology enables it to gain awareness of threats and swiftly adapt processes to changing situations along the border.
  Combating Human Smuggling
USBP’s posture and response to migration events are informed by comprehensive analyses of information and intelligence on operations of smugglers and the movement of migrants. We are more effectively tracking movements of various migrant groups who may be headed towards the U.S. border and increasing investigation and prosecution of human smuggling networks responsible for unauthorized border crossings.
CBP launched Operation Sentinel, a new counter-network targeting operation focused directly on TCOs affiliated with smuggling migrants into the United States, in April 2021. More than 480 nonimmigrant visas and more than 300 Global Entry and SENTRI cards have been revoked since the launch of Operation Sentinel, and more than 20 businesses and associated entities have been targeted for suspension or debarment. Lookouts have been placed on 2,822 individuals associated with TCOs’ illicit activity. More than 2,000 individuals involved in illicit money transactions have been identified and referred to interagency partners for law enforcement actions. Operation Sentinel refers all cases with potential prosecutorial interest to Federal and state investigative partners for review and prosecution.
Additionally, USBP supports the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)-established Joint Task Force Alpha initiative, which counters TCOs affiliated with migrant smuggling by targeting their members and associates. DHS and its components are working with DOJ to leverage joint investigative, prosecutorial, and capacity-building efforts to investigate and prosecute the most prolific and dangerous human smuggling and human trafficking groups operating in Mexico and northern Central America.
Migrant smugglers put vulnerable individuals and families in danger every day. The Southwest Border region experiences dramatic and unpredictable temperature changes year-round, meaning individuals lost or left behind in desolate areas are at risk of drowning, dehydration, heat stroke, injuries, or death. During FY 2022, USBP agents rescued more than 22,075 individuals in a wide variety of circumstances. This critical work continues, and agents have conducted nearly 8,000 rescues already this fiscal year. CBP has increased the number of rescue beacons used on the Southwest Border and our CBP officers and agents continue to stand ready to provide lifesaving assistance to all who need it.
  Interdicting Illicit Drugs
USBP remains focused on the TCOs that continue to expand across and beyond the Southwest and Northern Borders and increasingly demonstrate their ability to illicitly transport synthetic narcotics, including methamphetamine, illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and fentanyl analogues. Most illicit drugs, including fentanyl, enter the United States through our Southwest Border ports of entry in privately owned vehicles, commercial vehicles, and even by pedestrians.[3]
Between the ports of entry, CBP continues to experience high numbers of incidents involving illicit use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), commonly referred to as “drones,” to facilitate unlawful movement of people and narcotics across the southwest border. TCOs and possibly Foreign State Actors use UAS to conduct unauthorized surveillance of CBP personnel and operations to pass information to contacts on the ground on where to guide noncitizens or transport illegal drugs to circumvent law enforcement. Sensor records, pilot and agent sightings and other sources of information also indicate the increasing use of drones to transport illegal drugs and other contraband across the border. This illicit activity threatens the safety of our frontline personnel, poses a collision risk to our aircraft, and adversely affects our border security operations.
TCOs continually adjust their criminal operations to circumvent law enforcement detection and interdiction by adjusting their tactics, techniques, and procedures in the smuggling of narcotics that can be transported in profitable quantities by advanced concealment techniques. Through intelligence gathering and analysis, advances in detection technology, counter network strategies, collaboration with other Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, and interdictions, USBP adjusts law enforcement operations to combat TCO illicit activity and disrupt their operations.
  Leveraging Technology and Supporting Agents
USBP relies on effective surveillance of suspect activity along the land borders as a critical element of CBP’s border security operations. In FY 2022, USBP continued to deploy proven, effective surveillance technology, including aerostats, mobile surveillance capability systems, remote video surveillance systems, and integrated fixed towers tailored to specific operational requirements along the highest trafficked areas of the Southwest Border.
USBP is also expanding its use of Team Awareness Kits, a digital tool that greatly enhances coordination and collaboration among response teams. This innovative solution enables tactical data to be generated, visualized, and securely shared. The tool facilitates daily operations for public safety organizations and allows different organizations which do not regularly communicate to maintain shared tactical awareness.
Technology is often regarded as a force multiplier, but it is meaningless without dedicated and skilled personnel to operate it. The men and women of USBP are our greatest asset, and their work is extremely demanding, both physically and emotionally. When planning and implementing any operational change or technological deployment, we assess and prioritize every opportunity to enhance the preparedness, safety, and well-being of the USBP workforce.
  Enhancing Resiliency
CBP lost 11 colleagues to suicide in calendar year 2021, 15 colleagues in 2022, and two in 2023. One is too many. It was a tough year for the well-being of our agents. We need to continue investing in programs that provide direct support and communicate critical information to our workforce and their families, while improving our operational capabilities to allow agents to focus on their primary mission. Additionally, we, as an agency, need to work to identify the root causes of why we are seeing suicides at the current rate.
USBP recently began the Be the One campaign as a call for action to bring suicidal ideation to the forefront. We need to check in on each other, not just at work, but in life, and talk to and engage with one another in meaningful ways. We work long hours away from our families, so we need to take care of one another.
CBP leadership has directed that every CBP employee receive in-person suicide prevention training in 2023. CBP’s Office of Training and Development, in partnership with the CBP Workforce & Resiliency Directorate and Dr. Kent Corso, developed a three-day train-the-trainer course that started in January as part of the effort to reach all hands.
USBP has also directed that every employee completes a two-day Basic Resiliency Skills Course by the end of calendar year 2023.
  Conclusion
Although the continued elevated levels of migration over the last several years have presented many challenges, they have also led USBP to evolve, adapt, increase efficiency, and invest in our processing enterprise and technology. These investments, together with the resiliency, dedication, and professionalism of the men and women of USBP, enable USBP’s continued mission success of securing our border and keeping the American people safe while providing proper care to those in our custody.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to your questions.

Save the Date – Border Security: EPA’s Increased FIFRA Import Enforcement Initiative
Bergeson & Campbell, P.C.
March 12, 2015
2:00 p.m. – 3:00 p.m. (EDT)
Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. (B&C®) is pleased to host a complimentary webinar on recent compliance and enforcement issues regarding the importation of pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2014 revisions to its Notice of Arrival (NOA) form (EPA Form 3540-1), coupled with EPA’s increasing scrutiny of pesticide imports, indicate that this is an issue of growing interest to EPA and could result in a rise of enforcement cases or, at a minimum, business disruption for shipments that are refused entry.
Speakers who will be highlighting recent developments and steps for importers to take to ensure compliance and avoid potential enforcement include: Eileen B. Salathé Gernhard, Lead Counsel — Regulatory and EH&S at Dow AgroSciences, LLC, B&C’s Lisa M. Campbell and Lisa R. Burchi, and attorney Jon Jacobs, a 25-year veteran of EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, now in private practice at Jacobs Stotsky PLLC. There will be 45 minutes of presentation followed by a 15 minute Q&A period.

Home News Testimony Written testimony of ICE for a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing titled “Securing the Border: Understanding Threats and Strategies for the Northern Border”
Written testimony of ICE Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Buffalo, Jim Spero for a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing titled “Securing the Border: Understanding Threats and Strategies for the Northern Border”
Release Date: April 22, 2015
342 Dirksen Senate Office Building
Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished members:
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the efforts of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to improve security along the Northern Border of the United States.
ICE employs a multi-layered law enforcement approach to Northern Border security based on an understanding that our geographic boundary with Canada is only one piece of the criminal continuum – it is neither the starting point nor the final destination of cross-border criminal activity. In fact, this illicit activity is often rooted in interior cities, as well as in smaller communities throughout the United States. It is in these communities where the vast profits are generated that sustain the operations of transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and where ICE succeeds on a daily basis, together with our interagency partners, in disrupting and dismantling the entire smuggling enterprise.
As the principal investigative agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is positioned to leverage its broad statutory authority to support border enforcement by working in close coordination with other DHS components and U.S. interagency partners, as well as our counterparts in Canadian law enforcement, to target TCOs involved in illicit travel, trade, and finance. ICE applies a full range of innovative investigative and enforcement techniques, including leading and participating in joint U.S.-Canadian task forces, undercover operations, controlled deliveries, asset identification and removal, confidential informants, and Title III electronic intercepts to identify TCOs and disrupt their operations.
ICE continues to disrupt cross-border criminal activity systematically at all stages and, through effective cooperation and collaboration with our federal, state, local, tribal, and international law enforcement partners, we are making it increasingly difficult for TCOs and other criminals to operate. Our activities along the Northern Border constitute an important part of the National Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy, and are fully supportive of the National Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime.
ICE Assets along the Northern Border
ICE currently has nearly 1,300 HSI Special Agents and 100 intelligence research specialists operating out of several ICE offices with responsibility for Northern Border states. Many of these agents and analysts are stationed at our various sub-offices located either on or in proximity to the Northern Border. HSI employs nearly 6,000 Special Agents in communities throughout the country who work tirelessly to detect, disrupt, and dismantle TCOs engaged in the smuggling of people, narcotics, bulk cash, weapons, and weapons-related components across our borders.
In fiscal year (FY) 2014, HSI’s seven Special Agent in Charge offices covering the Northern Border, often in joint or cooperative investigations with federal, state, local, tribal and Canadian law enforcement, seized a combined total of more than $237 million in cash and monetary instruments, nearly 26,000 pounds of marijuana, 1,995 pounds of cocaine, 146 pounds of ecstasy, 719 pounds of heroin, 949 pounds of methamphetamine, 1,354 weapons and firearms, 55,164 rounds of ammunition, and 8,374 weapon components. HSI Special Agents made approximately 5,729 criminal arrests resulting in 3,752 indictments, and 3,481 convictions. These statistics reflect the impact of our coordinated law enforcement investments and investigations along the Northern Border.
Additionally, HSI maintains the largest investigative footprint of any U.S. law enforcement agency in Canada. HSI’s four attaché and assistant attaché offices, located in Ottawa, Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal, further enhance national security by serving as the agency’s liaison to our interagency partners and counterparts in local government and law enforcement. Like its other international offices, HSI’s Canada offices also support the efforts of the HSI Visa Security Program. As part of this program, HSI works cooperatively with the U.S. Department of State and other partners to prevent terrorists, criminals, and other ineligible applicants from receiving visas issued by the United States by providing visa security activities including, examining visa applications for fraud, conducting in-depth interviews of select special interest persons before they enter the United States, and providing law enforcement training and advice to the Department of State consulates.
Northern Border Partnerships
A crucial aspect of our approach to Northern Border security is our partnerships with our colleagues across DHS components, as well as with federal, state, county, local, tribal, and foreign agencies. These partnerships are essential to joint operations and information sharing along the Northern Border and beyond, and are conducted in the spirit of the President and the Prime Minister’s “Beyond the Border” initiative which seeks to promote integrated cross-border law enforcement. Collectively, these agencies possess a unique understanding of the threats, risks, and vulnerabilities along the Northern Border that enhance our ability to deter, disrupt, and investigate illegal cross-border activity.
ICE is also an active participant in the Canada – United States Cross Border Crime Forum (CBCF). The CBCF endeavors to meet annually, with smaller working-level meetings throughout the year, bringing together senior law enforcement officials and prosecutors from Canada and the United States to address cross-border issues, including counterterrorism cooperation, mass-marketing fraud, interoperability of our respective law enforcement agencies along the border, and combating organized crime. The plenary CBCF met on March 31, 2015, in Ottawa, Ontario, and ICE participated in the meeting. Currently, the CBCF takes the lead on integrated cross-border law enforcement and cross-border undercover operations along the Northern Border, and will have a leading role in implementing the Beyond the Border Action Plan. In addition, we have taken a number of steps to better integrate domestic Northern Border enforcement efforts. For instance, ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Border Patrol leadership meet on a regular basis along with leaders of other DHS components to discuss areas of mutual concern.
Border Enforcement Security Task Force
HSI’s flagship task force program, the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST), was created in 2005 as a mechanism to address the threat of cross-border crime. BEST provides a proven and flexible platform from which DHS investigates and targets transnational criminal organizations that attempt to exploit perceived vulnerabilities at our nation’s borders. BEST units differ from other task forces due to the BEST units’ proximity to the borders, and in the program’s focus on cross-border criminal activity. In 2007, ICE began to deploy BEST units along the Northern Border. Congress codified the establishment of the program by passing the Jaime Zapata Border Enforcement Security Task Force Act, which was signed into law by President Obama in December 2012. Currently, there are four BEST units operating along the Northern Border: Blaine, Washington; Detroit, Michigan; Buffalo, New York; and Massena, New York.
One significant advantage of the BEST task force model is the participation and integration of foreign law enforcement personnel to address criminal activity on both sides of the border. On the Northern Border, Canadian law enforcement participation includes representatives from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canada Border Services Agency, the Ontario Provincial Police, the Niagara Regional Police Service, the Windsor Police Service, the Peel Regional Police Service, the Akwesasne Mohawk Tribal Police, the Toronto Police Service, and the Police Nationale du Québec Sûreté (Quebec Provincial Police).
In addition to our Canadian partners, we receive the support and participation of our partner U.S. law enforcement agencies including: CBP; the U.S. Coast Guard; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. These task forces enable United States and Canadian law enforcement agencies to identify threats, address vulnerabilities, and identify, investigate, disrupt, and dismantle TCOs in a cohesive and coordinated environment.
Illicit Pathways Attack Strategy
In 2011, ICE developed the Illicit Pathways Attack Strategy (IPAS). IPAS supports the Administration’s Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime, an initiative launched in July 2011, which seeks to integrate federal resources in order to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security and public safety while urging foreign partners to do the same.
As a key part of this effort, IPAS is working to identify and dismantle high-risk smuggling and trafficking routes, pathways, and integrated networks that support transnational organized crime. IPAS initially focused on combating human smuggling and has now expanded to illicit finance, trafficking in cultural property, artifacts and antiquities. IPAS is a coordinated strategy to identify illicit pathways and attack criminal networks at multiple locations along the illicit travel continuum. The concept involves:
Attacking criminal networks within and beyond our borders;
Prioritizing networks and pathways that pose the greatest threats;
Participating in and facilitating robust interagency engagement; and
Pursuing a coordinated, regional approach that leverages foreign partners.
In 2011, our IPAS focused on high-risk human smuggling in the Western Hemisphere to identify and target human smuggling organizations and their pathways across the globe. ICE plays a key role in investigating human smuggling and this core mission function has a direct impact on national security, public safety, and human dignity.
In an effort to combat TCOs involved in human smuggling, IPAS works towards prioritizing the networks and pathways utilized by criminal organizations that pose the greatest threat to public safety and national security. This is achieved through robust interagency engagement and coordinating a regional approach that leverages foreign partners. IPAS also leverages subject matter experts and interagency intelligence centers to produce focused intelligence collection and analytic assessments to develop and share timely and actionable intelligence.
In addition, IPAS combines traditional law enforcement investigations and prosecutions with a holistic government effort to overtly disrupt and deter the underlying criminal activity. Our experience has shown that if we simply try to disrupt criminal activity by focusing law enforcement action in one geographic area, criminal organizations will quickly adapt and shift to an area where detection or interdiction by law enforcement is less likely. ICE seeks not only to stop individual criminals, but to reduce overall criminal activity by disrupting and dismantling the entire criminal enterprise.
Examples of Successful Collaboration
Recognizing that partnerships with our international law enforcement partners is vital to identifying, disrupting, and dismantling TCOs, HSI has worked to coordinate with our Canadian counterparts beyond our shared border. This collaborative relationship can be seen clearly through the following case examples.
Operation Primed is an HSI Buffalo investigation which targeted a cocaine smuggling organization involved in the illicit movement of cocaine and bulk cash within Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Investigators estimated that this organization was responsible for smuggling approximately 1,600 kilograms of cocaine into Canada with a street value of over $60 million. Through successful collaboration with Canadian law enforcement, in May 2014, a U.S. Department of Justice-designated Regional Priority Organization Target was sentenced in the Western District of New York to 84 months incarceration for violation of 21 U.S.C. § 863, import or export of drug paraphernalia. This individual was arrested in September 2010 when attempting to export 97 kilograms of cocaine across the Lewiston Bridge Port of Entry from New York into Canada. The 97 kilograms represents the single largest cocaine seizure in the Port of Buffalo’s history.
An additional investigation involved joint U.S. and Canadian law enforcement efforts to dismantle a British Columbia-based group whose operations stretch across the entire Northern Border and beyond. This violent criminal organization operated from the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and was actively involved in large-scale narcotics trafficking and money laundering activities. Its operations stretch into the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, India, Vietnam, Australia, and Great Britain. This gang exported large quantities of Canadian-grown marijuana into the United States and used the revenue generated to purchase cocaine from abroad, which was then smuggled into British Columbia and sold throughout Canada. During a recent HSI-led investigation with our Canadian, federal, state and local law enforcement partners, HSI uncovered evidence that the the British Columbia-base group imports hundreds of pounds of cocaine into British Columbia every month.
After Canadian marijuana is smuggled into the United States, UN Gang members sell it for U.S. dollars. These proceeds are then smuggled by couriers in the form of bulk currency from cities across the United States to California where they are used to purchase cocaine from abroad. This cocaine, in turn, is smuggled into Canada and subsequently sold for Canadian dollars. This method of drug trafficking and money laundering exemplifies the sophistication and reach of the TCOs, and is deemed to be an ongoing drug trafficking trend. Significant enforcement outcomes have been attributed to this investigation, including the seizure of 2,169 pounds of marijuana, 335 kilograms of cocaine, two pounds of crack cocaine, four pounds of methamphetamine, five firearms, $125,000 worth of jewelry and approximately $2 million in currency.
Conclusion
HSI investigative and intelligence personnel are working tirelessly in coordination with DHS and our interagency counterparts, as well as with our Canadian colleagues, to identify, disrupt and dismantle TCOs that subvert the rule of law, violate our immigration and customs laws, destabilize our communities, and threaten national security. ICE commits substantial resources to securing the Northern Border, and our considerable efforts are part of a comprehensive strategy that focuses on securing the border, dismantling the infrastructure that supports cross-border criminal activity, and identifying and seizing the illicit profits from these crimes.
We are dedicated and committed to this mission, and we look forward to continuing to work with this committee on these efforts. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today.
I would be pleased to answer any questions.

Why Immigration Enforcement Effectiveness Should Be Measured
Posted by Mark Noferi | Apr 16, 2015 | Border Enforcement, Enforcement
For decades, the United States has been pursuing an “enforcement-first” approach to immigration control, spending more on immigration enforcement than all other law enforcement combined, but failing to address our dysfunctional immigration system. A new report by the Bipartisan Policy Center’s (BPC’s) Immigration Task Force, called “Measuring the Metrics: Grading the Government on Immigration Enforcement,” offers a data-driven first step towards breaking this pattern.
The bipartisan Task Force, chaired by former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, tackles a key question regarding immigration enforcement: “How much is enough”? Their report proposes metrics for DHS to measure the performance of immigration enforcement, rather than merely relying on “inputs”—the amount of enforcement funding, the number of agents deployed, or miles of border fencing.
Crucially, BPC’s report argues that objective public metrics help facilitate robust debate and the political success of sustainable immigration reform. As BPC’s report points out, a majority of the U.S. public believes that illegal immigration has grown over the past decade, that U.S. borders are not secure enough, and that the government should do more to secure them. Yet, data suggests that illegal immigration has fallen. “Without objective measures of border control that are publicized widely, policymakers and the public are unlikely to agree on the state of border security”—let alone whether or how to “improve” it.
Moreover, BPC’s report stated that a “100 percent apprehension rate” at the border, as the House Homeland Security Committee recently proposed, “may not be possible” given the “history of borders around the world.” Indeed, the bill recently considered by the House Homeland Security Committee would try to make the U.S. southern border more secure than the Berlin Wall, which only achieved a 95 percent apprehension rate while its officers had shoot-to-kill orders. This bill also contained provisions to “certify” effective enforcement, even stricter than similar provisions in the U.S. Senate’s 2013 immigration reform bill. As BPC’s report notes, though, “had consistent performance measures already been established before this debate,” policymakers would likely have an “easier time” agreeing on future goals, tracking measures, and certification requirements (if even necessary).
Additionally, BPC’s report recognizes that enforcement can have “unintended consequences,” especially at recent high levels.  For example, the report notes that 1990s efforts to crack down on border crossings near San Diego and El Paso merely “redirected the crossings to more dangerous areas, which increased migrant deaths,” as organizations like No More Deaths have reported. The report notes other secondary effects as well: increases in criminality or violence at the border, disruption to local ways of life, environmental impacts, and impacts on civil rights.
Indeed, perhaps most importantly, BPC’s report recommends developing an “integrated,” “holistic” model of measuring immigration enforcement within the larger context of migrants’ decisions and incentives, U.S. policy decisions that influence those incentives, and unintended consequences of those decisions. As the report states, “there are so many factors influencing the decision to immigrate that are outside of the control of U.S. border or immigration policies”—many of them economic, demographic, or other factors. Such a model “would allow policymakers and the public to assess the cost-effectiveness of different enforcement policies.”
A holistic assessment like that would be a welcome step in the right direction—a step away from the current system of “throwing good money after bad” on “enforcement-first” policies.

""When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half.""
— President Obama, November 20, 2014
Under the Obama administration, the resources that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dedicates to security at the Southwest border are at an all-time high. Today, there are 3,000 additional Border Patrol agents along the Southwest Border, and our border fencing, unmanned aircraft surveillance systems, and ground surveillance systems have more than doubled since 2008. Taken as a whole, the additional boots on the ground, technology, and resources provided in the last six years represent the most serious and sustained effort to secure our border in our nation’s history, cutting illegal border crossings by more than half.
And this effort is producing results. From 1990 to 2007, the population of undocumented individuals in the United States grew from 3.5 million to 11 million people. Since then, the size of the undocumented population has stopped growing for the first time in decades. Border apprehensions — a key indicator of border security — are at their lowest level since the 1970s. The President’s immigration reform proposal gives law enforcement the tools they need to make our communities safer from crime. And by enhancing our infrastructure and technology, the President’s proposal continues to strengthen our ability to remove criminals and apprehend and prosecute threats to our national security.
To build on these efforts and to ensure that our limited enforcement resources are used effectively, the President has announced the following actions:
Shifting resources to the border and recent border crossers. Over the summer, DHS sent hundreds of Border Patrol agents and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel to the Southwest border, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) reordered dockets in immigration courts to prioritize removal cases of recent border crossers. This continued focus will help keep our borders safe and secure. In addition, Secretary Johnson is announcing a new Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan, which will strengthen the efforts of the agencies who work to keep our border secure. And by establishing clearer priorities for interior enforcement, DHS is increasing the likelihood that people attempting to cross the border illegally will be apprehended and sent back.
Streamlining the immigration court process. DOJ is announcing a package of immigration court reforms that will address the backlog of pending cases by working with DHS to more quickly adjudicate cases of individuals who meet new DHS-wide enforcement priorities and close cases of individuals who are low priorities. DOJ will also pursue regulations that adopt best practices for court systems to use limited court hearing time as efficiently as possible.
Protecting victims of crime and human trafficking as well as workers. The Department of Labor (DOL) is expanding and strengthening immigration options for victims of crimes (U visas) and trafficking (T visas) who cooperate in government investigations. An interagency working group will also explore ways to ensure that workers can avail themselves of their labor and employment rights without fear of retaliation.
The President's Proposal
Strengthen border security and infrastructure.
The President’s proposal strengthens and improves infrastructure at ports of entry, facilitates public-private partnerships aimed at increasing investment in foreign visitor processing, and continues supporting the use of technologies that help to secure the land and maritime borders of the United States.
Combat transnational crime.
The President’s proposal creates new criminal penalties dedicated to combating transnational criminal organizations that traffic in drugs, weapons, and money, and that smuggle people across the borders. It also expands the scope of current law to allow for the forfeiture of these organizations’ criminal tools and proceeds. Through this approach, we will bolster our efforts to deprive criminal enterprises, including those operating along the Southwest border, of their infrastructure and profits.
Improve partnerships with border communities and law enforcement.
The President’s proposal expands our ability to work with our cross-border law enforcement partners. Community trust and cooperation are key to effective law enforcement. To this end, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will establish border community liaisons along the Southern and Northern borders to improve communication and collaboration with border communities, boost funding to tribal government partners to reduce illegal activity on tribal lands, and strengthen training on civil rights and civil liberties for DHS immigration officers.
Crack down on criminal networks engaging in passport and visa fraud and human smuggling.
The President’s proposal creates tough criminal penalties for trafficking in passports and immigration documents and schemes to defraud, including those who prey on vulnerable immigrants through notario fraud. It also strengthens penalties to combat human smuggling rings.

GAO CONTACTS
Highlights
What GAO Found
The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses two processes to enforce exclusion orders issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC): a four-phase process to detect and deny entry to or seize infringing products at U.S. ports and an administrative ruling process that determines in advance of importing whether products are covered by exclusion orders. In the first phase of the process to enforce exclusion orders at the ports, CBP drafts a trade alert that provides enforcement instructions to CBP national targeting groups and local officials at all ports of entry to identify shipments for examination; without an alert, officials said, it would be difficult for CBP components to enforce an exclusion order. From September 2010 through April 2014, CBP excluded 158 shipments of products, such as ink cartridges and footwear. Before a company attempts to import a certain product, it may request that CBP determine through its administrative ruling process whether the product is covered by a particular exclusion order.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Process to Enforce Exclusion Orders at the Ports
CBP's management of its exclusion order enforcement process at the ports contains weaknesses that result in inefficiencies and an increased risk of infringing products entering U.S. commerce. First, CBP does not routinely review ITC's list of exclusion orders or take other action to ensure that a trade alert has been posted to its intranet for each order. At GAO's request, CBP reviewed ITC's list of exclusion orders as of April 30, 2014, and reported that it had posted trade alerts for 83 of the 94 exclusion orders; however, it posted 17 of the 83 trade alerts after GAO's request for data. Without routinely taking action to ensure that trade alerts are posted to CBP's intranet, infringing products could enter into U.S. commerce. Second, CBP does not routinely review ITC's list of exclusion orders to identify orders that may be candidates for rescission by ITC. Requesting rescission of exclusion orders could enable CBP to focus its enforcement efforts more effectively and efficiently. Third, CBP's guidance lacks time frames for issuing trade alerts, which prevents CBP from monitoring timeliness. GAO found that it took CBP from 2 days to 3 months to request a posting of a trade alert to the intranet during the period from October 2009 through April 2014. Without actively managing trade alerts and establishing time frames for posting alerts, CBP management cannot hold staff accountable for timely enforcement of exclusion orders, and there is an increased risk of infringing products entering U.S. commerce.
Why GAO Did This Study
Under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, ITC investigates allegations of unfair import practices, including unlicensed use of intellectual property rights such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks. If ITC finds a violation of this law, it generally issues an exclusion order that directs CBP to deny entry of infringing products into U.S. commerce. CBP must determine, without inhibiting legitimate trade, whether products arriving at 328 U.S. ports are covered by exclusion orders.
GAO was asked to review CBP's enforcement of exclusion orders. This report (1) describes CBP's processes for enforcing exclusion orders and (2) assesses CBP's management of its enforcement process at ports of entry. GAO analyzed CBP and ITC documents and data from October 2009 through April 2014 and interviewed CBP and ITC officials.
Recommendations
GAO recommends that CBP update its internal guidance with requirements to (1) routinely ensure that trade alerts are posted to the CBP intranet for each exclusion order, (2) routinely identify any orders whose changed conditions merit a CBP request that ITC rescind them, and (3) monitor timeliness of trade alert issuance. CBP concurred with recommendations one and three and described actions planned or under way to address them. However, CBP did not concur with recommendation number two. According to CBP, it is not mandated to identify potentially outdated orders and request that ITC rescind them. GAO continues to believe the recommendation is valid for reasons discussed in the report.
Recommendations for Executive Action
Agency Affected Recommendation Status
Department of Homeland Security To improve CBP's management of its process for enforcing exclusion orders, the Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the CBP Commissioner to update CBP's internal guidance with requirements to monitor timeliness by establishing time frames for issuing trade alerts for exclusion orders and reviewing performance against these standards.
Closed – Implemented
In its written comments on the draft report, Customs and Border Protection (CBP)concurred with the recommendation to monitor timeliness by establishing time frames for issuing trade alerts for exclusion orders and reviewing performance against these standards. In January 2015, CBP implemented the recommendation. CBP's Office of International Trade updated its internal SOP for the Intellectual Property Rights Branch within its Regulations and Rulings Directorate to include procedures for the timely posting of trade alerts following the issuance by ITC of an exclusion order. The SOP establishes timeframes for drafting and posting trade alerts. Specifically, the SOP directs the IPR Branch to...

In an October 2014 letter, CBP commented that it concurred with the GAO recommendation and stated that its Office of International Trade would update its internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the enforcement of trade alerts. In January 2015, CBP implemented the recommendation. CBP's Office of International Trade updated its internal SOP for the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Branch within its Regulations and Rulings Directorate that established procedures to routinely ensure that every active exclusion order has a trade alert posted on the CBP intranet Specifically, the SOP outlines a process for assigning exclusion orders to individual attorneys who are accountable for...

In January 2015, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) told GAO that it did not concur with our recommendation to update its guidance with a requirement to routinely identify any orders whose changed conditions merit a CBP request that the International Trade Commission (ITC)rescind them. CBP noted that there is no statutory or regulatory authority mandating that it monitor the ITC's list of exclusion orders to determine if changed conditions of law or fact would warrant the rescission of any of the orders. In addition, CBP asserted that ITC, as the issuing agency of exclusion orders, and the relevant complainants, or both have responsibility for ensuring that the list of outstanding exclusion...

CBP's Updated Enforcement and Removal Policies
On November 20, 2014, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced new immigration enforcement priorities and guidance on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in a memorandum entitled Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants. DHS agencies, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), will apply these enforcement and removal priorities when determining whether to remove an alien from the United States.  Consistent with the Secretary’s direction, CBP will continue to prioritize threats to national security, public safety, and border security.  CBP is updating its procedures and training to implement the new priorities.
The following sections provide additional information that may be helpful: 
For individuals in CBP custody
An individual encountered by CBP at a Port of Entry or near the U.S. border may be subject to additional processing, including, for example, to determine identity and immigration status.  Such additional processing may require CBP to temporarily hold an individual at a CBP Port of Entry or Border Patrol Station. 
If you (or a family member) were apprehended and processed by a CBP officer or Border Patrol agent and then placed into removal proceedings and you believe that you do not fall within the DHS enforcement priorities, please tell us about your experience by contacting the CBP INFO Center at:
General Inquiries: 877-227-5511
International Callers: 202-325-8000
TDD: 866-880-6582
Hours of Operations: Monday - Friday, 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time).
To offer additional feedback to the agency, please visit CBP’s website at https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1133/search/1.
For individuals in immigration proceedings before the Executive Office for Immigration Review
If your administrative proceedings are pending before an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals, and you believe that you do not fall within the DHS enforcement priorities, you should contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  If you wish ICE to review your case, please visit ICE’s website for information on how to submit such a request to the ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA).
For individuals with removal orders who are scheduled for removal and are not in CBP custody
If you have been ordered removed and you believe that you do not fall within the DHS enforcement priorities, you should contact the ICE Enforcement and Removal Office (ERO) Detention Reporting and Information Line, toll-free, at 1-888-351-4024 to submit a request for review of your case. 
For individuals who wish to file a complaint regarding a CBP removal encounter
Individuals wishing to submit a formal complaint pertaining to an encounter with a CBP officer or Border Patrol agent can contact the CBP INFO Center at 877-227-5511.

Hampton Roads Border Security Enforcement Taskforce intercepts 35 kilos of cocaine in 2 weeks
Hampton Roads Border Security Enforcement Taskforce intercepts 35 kilos of cocaine in 2 weeks
NORFOLK, Va. — The Hampton Roads-based multi-agency Border Enforcement Security Task Force has seized approximately 35 kilograms of cocaine at the Port of Norfolk in the past two weeks in separate drug smuggling ventures.
The Hampton Roads Border Enforcement Security Taskforce is comprised of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Coast Guard and other law enforcement partners.
In the first seizure, which occurred July 27, the task force seized 32 kilograms of cocaine off of a vessel arriving into the Port of Norfolk. Prior to the vessel arriving in Hampton Roads, HSI special agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, and Coast Guardsmen boarded the vessel and discovered the cocaine hidden in one of the vessel cargo holds. The cocaine, which has an estimated street value of about $1 million, is believed to have come from Colombia and was destined for Europe. None of the crewmembers were suspected of being involved and no arrests were made.
A second seizure occurred Aug. 4 when the task force seized three kilograms of cocaine. The narcotics were taken off of a container vessel that was due into Hampton Roads. This seizure resulted in the arrest of two individuals, neither of whom were ship crewmembers. This investigation is ongoing.
""These enforcement actions demonstrate that law enforcement agencies working together under the auspices of the BEST, are positioned to disrupt and dismantle smuggling organizations' efforts to bring their illicit goods into the United States,"" said John P. Torres, special agent in charge of HSI. ""The Hampton Roads BEST is host to Homeland Security Investigations, Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast Guard with other federal, state and local law enforcement partners to bring together the strengths of each agency into one united front.""
""I am very proud of the work of my officers and the BEST,"" said Mark J. Laria, CBP area port director. ""This seizure is further evidence of how the law enforcement authorities in Hampton Roads can quickly pull together as a team to protect the citizens of Hampton Roads and the country.""
The Hampton Roads Border Enforcement Security Taskforce was formed in July 2011 and is comprised of officers and agents from ten federal, state and local agencies. Team members are responsible for identifying, interdicting and investigating a wide variety of maritime-related crime including trade fraud, cargo theft and the illegal smuggling of drugs, persons, currency and weapons.

Fact Sheet: Immigration Accountability Executive Action
Home | News & Events | Fact Sheet: Immigration Accountability Executive Action
The President’s Immigration Accountability Executive Actions will help secure the border, hold nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants accountable, and ensure that everyone plays by the same rules.  Acting within his legal authority, the President is taking an important step to fix our broken immigration system.
These executive actions crack down on illegal immigration at the border, prioritize deporting felons not families, and require certain undocumented immigrants to pass a criminal background check and pay their fair share of taxes as they register to temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation.
These are common sense steps, but only Congress can finish the job. As the President acts, he’ll continue to work with Congress on a comprehensive, bipartisan bill—like the one passed by the Senate more than a year ago—that can replace these actions and fix the whole system.
Three critical elements of the President’s executive actions are:
Cracking Down on Illegal Immigration at the Border:  The President’s actions increase the chances that anyone attempting to cross the border illegally will be caught and sent
back. Continuing the surge of resources that effectively reduced the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally this summer, the President’s actions will also centralize
border security command-and-control to continue to crack down on illegal immigration.
Deporting Felons, Not Families: The President’s actions focus on the deportation of people who threaten national security and public safety. He has directed immigration enforcement to place anyone suspected of terrorism, violent criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers at the top of the deportation priority list.
Accountability – Criminal Background Checks and Taxes: The President is also acting to hold accountable those undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for more than five years and are parents of U.S. citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents.  By registering and passing criminal and national security background checks, millions of undocumented immigrants will start paying their fair share of taxes and temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation for three years at a time.
The President’s actions will also streamline legal immigration to boost our economy and will promote naturalization for those who qualify.
For more than a half century, every president—Democratic or Republican—has used his legal authority to act on immigration.  President Obama is now taking another commonsense step. As the Administration implements these executive actions, Congress should finish the job by passing a bill like the bipartisan Senate bill that: continues to strengthen border security by adding 20,000 more Border Patrol agents; cracks down on companies who hire undocumented workers; creates an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who pay a fine and taxes, pass a background check, learn English and go to  the back of the line; and boosts our economy and keeps families together by cutting red tape to simplify our legal immigration process.
CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AT THE BORDER
Under the Obama Administration, the resources that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dedicates to security at the Southwest border are at an all-time high.  Today, there are 3,000 additional Border Patrol agents along the Southwest Border and our border fencing, unmanned aircraft surveillance systems, and ground surveillance systems have more than doubled since 2008. Taken as a whole, the additional boots on the ground, technology, and resources provided in the last six years represent the most serious and sustained effort to secure our border in our Nation’s history, cutting illegal border crossings  by more than half.
And this effort is producing results. From 1990 to 2007, the population of undocumented individuals in the United States grew from 3.5 million to 11 million people.  Since then, the size of the undocumented population has stopped growing for the first time in decades. Border apprehensions—a key indicator of border security— are at their lowest level since the 1970s.  This past summer, the President and the entire Administration responded to the influx of unaccompanied children with an aggressive, coordinated Federal response focused on heightened deterrence, enhanced enforcement, stronger foreign cooperation, and greater capacity for Federal agencies to ensure that our border remains secure.  As a result, the number of unaccompanied children attempting to cross the Southwest border has declined precipitously, and the Administration continues to focus its resources to prevent a similar situation from developing in the future.
To build on these efforts and to ensure that our limited enforcement resources are used effectively, the President has announced the following actions:
Shifting resources to the border and recent border crossers. Over the summer, DHS sent hundreds of Border Patrol agents and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel to the Southwest border, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) reordered dockets in immigration courts
to prioritize removal cases of recent border crossers.  This continued focus will help keep our borders safe and secure. In addition, Secretary Johnson is announcing a new Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan which will strengthen the efforts of the agencies who work to keep our border secure.  And by establishing clearer priorities for interior enforcement, DHS is increasing the likelihood that people attempting to cross the border illegally will be apprehended and sent back.
Streamlining the immigration court process. DOJ is announcing a package of immigration court reforms that will address the backlog of pending cases by working with DHS to more quickly adjudicate cases of individuals who meet new DHS-wide enforcement priorities and close cases of individuals who are low priorities. DOJ will also pursue regulations that adopt best practices for court systems to use limited court hearing time as efficiently as possible.
Protecting victims of crime and human trafficking as well as workers. The Department of Labor (DOL) is expanding and strengthening immigration options for victims of crimes (U visas) and trafficking (T visas) who cooperate in government investigations.  An interagency working group will also explore ways to ensure that workers can avail themselves of their labor and employment rights without fear of retaliation.
DEPORTING FELONS, NOT FAMILIES
By setting priorities and focusing its enforcement resources, the Obama Administration has already increased the removal of criminals by more than 80%.  These actions build on that strong record by:
Focusing on the removal of national security, border security, and public safety threats.  To better focus on the priorities that matter, Secretary Johnson is issuing a new DHS-wide memorandum
that makes clear that the government’s enforcement activity should be focused on national
security threats, serious criminals, and recent border crossers.  DHS will direct all of its enforcement resources at pursuing these highest priorities for removal.
Implementing a new Priority Enforcement Program. Effectively identifying and removing criminals in state and local jails is a critical goal but it must be done in a way that sustains the community’s trust. To address concerns from Governors, Mayors, law enforcement and community leaders which have undermined cooperation with DHS, Secretary Johnson is replacing the existing Secure Communities program with a new Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) to remove those convicted of criminal offenses.  DHS will continue to rely on biometric data to verify individuals who are enforcement priorities, and they will also work with DOJ’s Bureau of Prisons to identify and remove federal criminals serving time as soon as possible.
ACCOUNTABILITY – CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND TAXES
Every Democratic and Republican president since Dwight Eisenhower has taken executive action on immigration.  Consistent with this long history, DHS will expand the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to include more immigrants who came to the U.S. as
children.  DHS will also create a new deferred action program for people who are parents of U.S. Citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) and have lived in the United States for five years or longer if they register, pass a background check and pay taxes.
The President is taking the following actions to hold accountable certain undocumented immigrants:
Creating a mechanism that requires certain undocumented immigrants to pass a background check to make sure that they start paying their fair share in taxes. In order to promote public safety, DHS is establishing a new deferred action program for parents of U.S. Citizens or LPRs who are not enforcement priorities and have been in the country for more than 5 years.  Individuals will have the opportunity to request temporary relief from deportation and work authorization for three years at a time if they come forward and register, submit biometric data, pass background checks, pay fees, and show that their child was born before the date of this announcement. By providing individuals with an opportunity to come out of the shadows and work legally, we will also help crack down on companies who hired undocumented workers, which undermines the wages of all workers, and ensure that individuals are playing by the rules and paying their fair share of taxes.
Expanding DACA to cover additional DREAMers. Under the initial DACA program, young people who had been in the U.S. for at least five years, came as children, and met specific education and public safety criteria were eligible for temporary relief from deportation so long as they were born after 1981 and entered the country before June 15, 2007.  DHS is expanding DACA so that individuals who were brought to this country as children can apply if they entered before January 1, 2010, regardless of how old they are today.  Going forward, DACA relief will also be granted for three years.
The President’s actions will also streamline legal immigration to boost our economy and promote naturalization by:
Providing portable work authorization for high-skilled workers awaiting LPR status and their spouses.  Under the current system, employees with approved LPR applications often wait many years for their visa to become available.  DHS will make regulatory changes to allow these workers to move or change jobs more easily.  DHS is finalizing new rules to give certain H-1B spouses employment authorization as long as the H-1B spouse has an approved LPR application.
Enhancing options for foreign entrepreneurs.  DHS will expand immigration options for foreign entrepreneurs who meet certain criteria for creating jobs, attracting investment, and generating revenue in the U.S., to ensure that our system encourages them to grow our economy.  The criteria will include income thresholds so that these individuals are not eligible for certain public benefits like welfare or tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.
Strengthening and extending on-the-job training for STEM graduates of U.S universities. In order to strengthen educational experiences of foreign students studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) at U.S. universities, DHS will propose changes to expand and extend the use of the existing Optional Practical Training (OPT) program and require stronger ties between OPT students and their colleges and universities following graduation.
Streamlining the process for foreign workers and their employers, while protecting American workers. DHS will clarify its guidance on temporary L-1 visas for foreign workers who transfer from a company’s foreign office to its U.S. office. DOL will take regulatory action to modernize the labor market test that is required of employers that sponsor foreign workers for immigrant visas while ensuring that American workers are protected.
Reducing family separation for those waiting to obtain LPR status. Due to barriers in our system, U.S. citizens and LPRs are often separated for years from their immediate relatives, while they wait to obtain their LPR status. To reduce the time these individuals are separated, DHS will expand an existing program that allows certain individuals to apply for a provisional waiver for certain violations before departing the United States to attend visa interviews.
Ensuring that individuals with lawful status can travel to their countries of origin. DHS will clarify its guidance to provide greater assurance to individuals with a pending LPR application or certain temporary status permission to travel abroad with advance permission (“parole”).
Issuing a Presidential Memorandum on visa modernization. There are many ways in which our legal immigration system can be modernized to reduce government costs, eliminate redundant systems, reduce burdens on employers and families, and eliminate fraud. The President is issuing a Memorandum directing an interagency group to recommend areas for improvement.
Creating a White House Task Force on New Americans. The President is creating a White House Task Force on New Americans to create a federal strategy on immigrant integration.
Promoting Citizenship Public Awareness: DHS will launch a comprehensive citizenship awareness media campaign in the 10 states that are home to 75 percent of the overall LPR population. USCIS will also expand options for paying naturalization fees and explore additional measures to expand accessibility, including studying potential partial fee waiver for qualified individuals.
Ensuring U.S. Citizens Can Serve: To further our military’s needs and support recruitment efforts, DHS will expand an existing policy to provide relief to spouses and children of U.S. citizens seeking to enlist in the military, consistent with a request made by the Department of Defense.

ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers enforce immigration laws within the interior to preserve national security and public safety.
ERO manages all aspects of the immigration enforcement process, including the identification, arrest, detention and removal of noncitizens who are subject to removal or are unlawfully present in the United States.
Like all law enforcement agencies, ERO officers prioritize their enforcement actions based on agency and department priorities, funding and capacity. ERO operations are flexible enough to allow its officers to respond to events such as spikes in border crossings, modifications to U.S. laws, pandemics, and natural disasters at home and abroad.
The following dashboards present for the first time information and trends in arrests, detentions, removals and alternatives to detention as of September 30, 2023.
The dashboards will be updated quarterly.
""With the public release of this enforcement data, ICE is demonstrating its commitment to openness and transparency. We will continue to evaluate and enhance how the agency communicates measurable data to best inform how our officers and special agents perform their law enforcement missions in accordance with departmental and agency priorities.”
— ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director Patrick J. Lechleitner
ERO enforces laws by arresting immigration violators in the interior of the United States. It relies on statutory law enforcement authority to identify and arrest noncitizens who may present threats to national security or public safety, or who otherwise undermine the integrity of U.S. immigration laws. ERO uses targeted, intelligence-driven operations to prioritize its enforcement actions in ways that help protect communities nationwide. While ERO primarily conducts administrative arrests of noncitizens it has probable cause to believe are removable from the United States, it also has the authority to execute criminal arrest warrants and initiate prosecutions for criminal activity, including immigration-related crimes. ERO officers assigned to task forces also help target and apprehend foreign fugitives in the United States who are wanted for crimes here and abroad by working with domestic and international partners.
Arrests by country of citizenship and criminal history: ERO arrests are broken down by country of citizenship and categories of criminal history that include people with:
U.S. criminal convictions.
Pending criminal charges in the United States.
No convictions or pending charges but who have broken U.S. immigration laws including visa overstays and Visa Waiver Program violators.*

*This category includes those who have repeatedly violated U.S. law by reentering after deportation, immigration fugitives with an executable final order of removal, and international fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad.
For fiscal years 2021 and 2022, this category also includes individuals apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States after January 1, 2021.
ERO arrests over time: Historically, ERO most commonly arrests immigration violators with convictions involving DUI, drug possession, assault and criminal (non-civil) traffic offenses such as hit-and-run or leaving the scene of an accident.
Arrests by Area of Responsibility (AOR): ERO has 25 field offices, which are geographic areas of responsibility, around the country, each headed by a field office director.
ARRESTS
 ICE provides the above Arrests, Removal, Detention and Alternatives to Detention statistics for public use. ICE confirms the integrity of the data as published on this site and cannot attest to subsequent transmissions. Data fluctuate until ""locked"" at the conclusion of the fiscal year. These statistics are published with data one quarter in arrears.
*The Harlingen AOR was added from parts of San Antonio and Houston in FY2022.
ERO oversees the civil immigration detention of one of the most diverse and rapidly changing detained populations in the world. It houses noncitizens in approximately 130 facilities across the nation. The ERO Headquarters Custody Management and ICE Health Service Corps divisions help officers in the field manage the detained population and ensure detained noncitizens’ health and safety, ensure compliance with ICE’s detention standards, and provide medical care — including mental health care — to detained individuals.
ICE detains individuals as necessary, including to secure their presence for immigration proceedings and removal from the United States. ICE also detains those who are subject to mandatory detention under U.S. immigration law and those a supervisor has determined are public safety or flight risks.
After ICE arrests and processes individuals for administrative immigration violations or CBP and other state, local and federal law enforcement partners turn them over to ICE, officials may detain them while their immigration cases are pending or release them under a form of supervision. Both ICE and the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review — the office that oversees the immigration court system — can impact custody status at various points during a noncitizen’s immigration proceedings.
Officials make custody determinations on an individual basis, taking into account all facets of a person’s situation, including their immigration history and criminal records. Authorities also consider family ties, humanitarian issues and whether a person may be a flight risk.
ICE is committed to ensuring that all noncitizens in detention reside in safe, secure and humane environments under appropriate conditions of confinement. As of September 30, 2023, ICE used 163 facilities across the United States to house individuals in detention, including five ICE-owned Service Processing Centers, 13 ICE contract detention facilities, and 25 dedicated intergovernmental service agreement facilities. The other facilities are non-dedicated intergovernmental service agreement facilities, such as 76 U.S. Marshals Service contracts, 44 county jails, and several Bureau of Prisons institutions. In recent years, Congress has funded ICE to house an average daily detained population of 34,000.
Whenever possible, ICE seeks to house detained individuals within the geographical areas of their arrests to minimize their time in ICE custody and keep them close to family, friends and legal representatives.
Most detained individuals are transfers from CBP following arrests at the border. ICE is legally obligated to detain some of these people, including those with certain criminal histories.
If a noncitizen or their representative believes they should not be subject to enforcement, detention or removal, they should contact their local ERO field office to request a case review or initiate the ICE Case Review process. People who want to contact ICE about their cases should first notify their local ERO field office via email with supporting documentation for an initial review.
Detention by country of citizenship and criminal history: Detained individuals are categorized in the following ways:
Individuals with criminal convictions.
Individuals with pending criminal charges.
Those with no convictions or pending charges but who have broken U.S. immigration laws.*

*The third category includes individuals without any known criminal convictions or pending charges who have repeatedly violated U.S. law by reentering after deportation; immigration fugitives with a final order of removal by an immigration judge; and foreign fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad.
Detention over time: Most detained individuals are transfers from CBP following arrests made at the border. Higher numbers of border crossings are typically associated with higher detention numbers.
DETENTION
ICE provides the above Arrests, Removal, Detention and Alternatives to Detention statistics for public use. ICE confirms the integrity of the data as published on this site and cannot attest to subsequent transmissions. Data fluctuate until ""locked"" at the conclusion of the fiscal year. These statistics are published with data one quarter in arrears.
*The Harlingen AOR was added from parts of San Antonio and Houston in FY2022.
ICE’s authority to remove noncitizens exists under the Immigration and Nationality Act pursuant to Title 8 of the U.S. Code, sometimes called “Title 8 authority.”
Between March 2020 and May 2023, the Department of Homeland Security quickly expelled irregular border crossers from the United States under a public health order the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued March 21, 2020, sometimes called “Title 42 authority.”
Title 8: ICE principally removes noncitizens from the United States after they have received a final order of removal. These removal operations require complex coordination, management and facilitation efforts to successfully remove and return noncitizens from the United States. ERO accomplishes this mission through charter flights and on commercial airlines for escorted and unescorted removals, in addition to ground transportation missions on the northern and southern borders and at ports of entry.
ERO’s highest-profile removals generally comprise fugitives wanted for serious crimes in other countries, such as homicide, gang-related offenses, corruption and fraud. Often, these individuals come to ERO’s attention because of Interpol notices. Other high-profile removals include known or suspected terrorists, those involved in counterproliferation crimes, and those on the terrorist watch list and no-fly list. War criminals and others convicted or suspected of committing human rights abuses — including torture, ethnic cleansing and genocide — are also in this category. Authorities escort high-profile removals out of the country via commercial flights, regularly scheduled ICE charter flights and special high-risk charters. In many cases, the individuals are turned over to law enforcement authorities in their home country to face charges or sentencing.
Title 42: Title 42 is a public health authority guided by the CDC and is not an immigration authority. On March 21, 2020, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services transferred Title 42 Public Health Authority to CBP. Under Title 42, CBP prohibited the entry of certain people who potentially posed a health risk by being subject to previously announced travel restrictions or having unlawfully entered the country to bypass health screening measures. Under Title 42 authority, DHS rapidly expelled irregular border crossers to their country of last transit — Canada or Mexico — or, when such an expulsion was not possible, interagency partners engaged foreign government officials to secure noncitizens’ expulsion to their countries of origin.

The Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program is a noncitizen compliance tool overseen by ERO.
ATD uses technology and case management to more closely monitor cases assigned to the non-detained docket where detention is not necessary or appropriate. The level of supervision and technology participants are assigned is based on their current immigration status, criminal history, compliance history, community or family ties, caregiver or provider status, and other humanitarian or medical conditions. Officials may enroll noncitizens in ATD following a border apprehension by CBP or an ICE interior administrative arrest, or at a later stage in removal proceedings.
In fiscal year 2023, ICE’s ATD program deployed the following types of monitoring:
Facial matching technology: Facial matching technology allows participants to report compliance via an app installed on a noncitizen’s own smartphone or a dedicated government-issued device.
GPS monitoring: Satellites track participants’ location to ensure compliance with conditions of release.
Telephonic reporting (telephonic check-in): Phone calls are compared against a voiceprint obtained during enrollment.
Wrist worn device: Provides GPS monitoring, facial matching, and virtual case management functionality, including virtual check-ins and reminders. ICE is conducting a limited deployment of 50 wrist worn devices in the Denver AOR.

Term Definition
AOR AOR refers to the area of responsibility that ICE has identified as a geographic region for an action taken.
Arresting Agency Arresting agency is either CBP or ICE. Border patrol and inspections by air, land or sea are the program areas included within the CBP data.
Arrests ICE administrative arrests occur when an ICE officer physically apprehends a noncitizen for a non-criminal civil infraction. The immigration courts hear these cases. ICE civil immigration enforcement arrests do not always lead to detention.
ATD ATD refers to ICE's Alternatives to Detention program. ATD is a flight-mitigation tool that uses technology and case management to ensure noncitizen compliance with release conditions, court hearings and final orders of removal while allowing them to remain in their communities as they move through the immigration process or prepare for departure from the United States.
CBP U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Citizenship Country Country of citizenship of the noncitizen. Country of Citizenship is derived from the ICE system of record as it is input by the officer at the time of processing. An ""Unknown"" Country indicates the noncitizen failed or refused to identify a country of citizenship or the officer lacked documentation to do so at the time. Country of Birth or Citizenship can be updated at anytime during the Immigration Lifecycle by an Officer. These noncitizens can include those that were born in Palestine, West Bank, or the Gaza strip and considered Stateless.
Criminality Criminality encompasses three categories: individuals with criminal convictions, people with pending criminal charges, and other immigration violators. Those with convictions are immigration violators who have a criminal conviction in ICE's system of record at the time of the enforcement action. Pending criminal charges refers to an immigration violator with pending criminal charges in ICE's system of record at the time of the enforcement action. Other immigration violators are individuals without any known criminal convictions or pending charges in ICE's system of record at the time of the enforcement action.
Detentions The detention data presented counts the number of initial book-ins into ICE facilities and does not include juveniles who are transferred to Office of Refugee Resettlement custody or housed in an ORR facility. U.S. Marshals Service prisoners are also excluded. Transfers between ICE facilities are not counted as new detention events, and noncitizens may be booked into ICE facilities more than once without triggering a new detention event.
Facial Monitoring Facial monitoring technology is a form of monitoring for ATD participants. It is a smartphone application that uses facial recognition technology to verify the user's identity and physical location. This application also provides video conferencing, community referrals, messaging between the noncitizen and an officer, document capturing, appointment reminders and a calendar.
GPS Ankle Monitor A GPS ankle monitor is a low-profile ankle bracelet that uses GPS to provide detailed information about an ATD participant's movement.
ICE U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Noncitizens People without U.S. citizenship or nationality, which may include stateless people.
Removals
ICE removal data includes returns. Returns include:
Voluntary returns: Discretionary relief granted by an ICE officer at the border by permitting a noncitizen to depart the United States without a removal order and related immigration consequences.
Voluntary departures: Discretionary relief granted in removal proceedings or by an ICE officer in lieu of removal proceedings permitting a noncitizen to depart the United States voluntarily without a removal order and related immigration consequences.
Withdrawals under docket control: Discretionary relief granted by an ICE officer or immigration judge to a noncitizen encountered at a port of entry that permits the noncitizen to voluntarily withdraw an application for admission to the United States and depart the United States without a removal order and related immigration consequences.
ICE Removals include noncitizens processed for Expedited Removal (ER) or Voluntary Return (VR) that are turned over to ERO for detention. As of May 12, 2023, noncitizens processed for ER that were turned over from Border Patrol to ICE for removal via ICE Air are also included. Noncitizens processed for ER and not detained by ERO or VR after June 1, 2013, and not detained by ERO are primarily processed by Border Patrol. Those statistics are not included in this dashboard and are maintained by CBP. This does not include Title 42 expulsions.
Staging sites or S-sites Staging sites, also known as S-Sites, are locations mostly along the Southwest Border that enroll participants being released from CBP or ICE custody. These participants are generally given fewer than 30 days to report to an ERO office in their final destination AOR. After a participant arrives in their AOR, local ATD officers determine their continued suitability in the ATD program and possible transition to other sites.
Telephonic Check-in Telephonic check-in is a form of monitoring in the ATD program and is a multilingual telephonic voice recognition system. Telephonic check-in automatically calls ATD program participants in one of 36 languages and validates participants’ voices against a master template resulting in pass or failure.
Wrist worn device Provides GPS monitoring, facial matching, and virtual case management functionality, including virtual check-ins and reminders.

ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers enforce immigration laws within the interior to preserve national security and public safety.
ERO manages all aspects of the immigration enforcement process, including the identification, arrest, detention and removal of noncitizens who are subject to removal or are unlawfully present in the United States.
Like all law enforcement agencies, ERO officers prioritize their enforcement actions based on agency and department priorities, funding and capacity. ERO operations are flexible enough to allow its officers to respond to events such as spikes in border crossings, modifications to U.S. laws, pandemics, and natural disasters at home and abroad.
The following dashboards present for the first time information and trends in arrests, detentions, removals and alternatives to detention as of September 30, 2023.
The dashboards will be updated quarterly.
""With the public release of this enforcement data, ICE is demonstrating its commitment to openness and transparency. We will continue to evaluate and enhance how the agency communicates measurable data to best inform how our officers and special agents perform their law enforcement missions in accordance with departmental and agency priorities.”
— ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director Patrick J. Lechleitner
ERO enforces laws by arresting immigration violators in the interior of the United States. It relies on statutory law enforcement authority to identify and arrest noncitizens who may present threats to national security or public safety, or who otherwise undermine the integrity of U.S. immigration laws. ERO uses targeted, intelligence-driven operations to prioritize its enforcement actions in ways that help protect communities nationwide. While ERO primarily conducts administrative arrests of noncitizens it has probable cause to believe are removable from the United States, it also has the authority to execute criminal arrest warrants and initiate prosecutions for criminal activity, including immigration-related crimes. ERO officers assigned to task forces also help target and apprehend foreign fugitives in the United States who are wanted for crimes here and abroad by working with domestic and international partners.
Arrests by country of citizenship and criminal history: ERO arrests are broken down by country of citizenship and categories of criminal history that include people with:
U.S. criminal convictions.
Pending criminal charges in the United States.
No convictions or pending charges but who have broken U.S. immigration laws including visa overstays and Visa Waiver Program violators.*

*This category includes those who have repeatedly violated U.S. law by reentering after deportation, immigration fugitives with an executable final order of removal, and international fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad.
For fiscal years 2021 and 2022, this category also includes individuals apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States after January 1, 2021.
ERO arrests over time: Historically, ERO most commonly arrests immigration violators with convictions involving DUI, drug possession, assault and criminal (non-civil) traffic offenses such as hit-and-run or leaving the scene of an accident.
Arrests by Area of Responsibility (AOR): ERO has 25 field offices, which are geographic areas of responsibility, around the country, each headed by a field office director.
ARRESTS
 ICE provides the above Arrests, Removal, Detention and Alternatives to Detention statistics for public use. ICE confirms the integrity of the data as published on this site and cannot attest to subsequent transmissions. Data fluctuate until ""locked"" at the conclusion of the fiscal year. These statistics are published with data one quarter in arrears.
*The Harlingen AOR was added from parts of San Antonio and Houston in FY2022.
ERO oversees the civil immigration detention of one of the most diverse and rapidly changing detained populations in the world. It houses noncitizens in approximately 130 facilities across the nation. The ERO Headquarters Custody Management and ICE Health Service Corps divisions help officers in the field manage the detained population and ensure detained noncitizens’ health and safety, ensure compliance with ICE’s detention standards, and provide medical care — including mental health care — to detained individuals.
ICE detains individuals as necessary, including to secure their presence for immigration proceedings and removal from the United States. ICE also detains those who are subject to mandatory detention under U.S. immigration law and those a supervisor has determined are public safety or flight risks.
After ICE arrests and processes individuals for administrative immigration violations or CBP and other state, local and federal law enforcement partners turn them over to ICE, officials may detain them while their immigration cases are pending or release them under a form of supervision. Both ICE and the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review — the office that oversees the immigration court system — can impact custody status at various points during a noncitizen’s immigration proceedings.
Officials make custody determinations on an individual basis, taking into account all facets of a person’s situation, including their immigration history and criminal records. Authorities also consider family ties, humanitarian issues and whether a person may be a flight risk.
ICE is committed to ensuring that all noncitizens in detention reside in safe, secure and humane environments under appropriate conditions of confinement. As of September 30, 2023, ICE used 163 facilities across the United States to house individuals in detention, including five ICE-owned Service Processing Centers, 13 ICE contract detention facilities, and 25 dedicated intergovernmental service agreement facilities. The other facilities are non-dedicated intergovernmental service agreement facilities, such as 76 U.S. Marshals Service contracts, 44 county jails, and several Bureau of Prisons institutions. In recent years, Congress has funded ICE to house an average daily detained population of 34,000.
Whenever possible, ICE seeks to house detained individuals within the geographical areas of their arrests to minimize their time in ICE custody and keep them close to family, friends and legal representatives.
Most detained individuals are transfers from CBP following arrests at the border. ICE is legally obligated to detain some of these people, including those with certain criminal histories.
If a noncitizen or their representative believes they should not be subject to enforcement, detention or removal, they should contact their local ERO field office to request a case review or initiate the ICE Case Review process. People who want to contact ICE about their cases should first notify their local ERO field office via email with supporting documentation for an initial review.
Detention by country of citizenship and criminal history: Detained individuals are categorized in the following ways:
Individuals with criminal convictions.
Individuals with pending criminal charges.
Those with no convictions or pending charges but who have broken U.S. immigration laws.*

*The third category includes individuals without any known criminal convictions or pending charges who have repeatedly violated U.S. law by reentering after deportation; immigration fugitives with a final order of removal by an immigration judge; and foreign fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad.
Detention over time: Most detained individuals are transfers from CBP following arrests made at the border. Higher numbers of border crossings are typically associated with higher detention numbers.
DETENTION
ICE provides the above Arrests, Removal, Detention and Alternatives to Detention statistics for public use. ICE confirms the integrity of the data as published on this site and cannot attest to subsequent transmissions. Data fluctuate until ""locked"" at the conclusion of the fiscal year. These statistics are published with data one quarter in arrears.
*The Harlingen AOR was added from parts of San Antonio and Houston in FY2022.
ICE’s authority to remove noncitizens exists under the Immigration and Nationality Act pursuant to Title 8 of the U.S. Code, sometimes called “Title 8 authority.”
Between March 2020 and May 2023, the Department of Homeland Security quickly expelled irregular border crossers from the United States under a public health order the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued March 21, 2020, sometimes called “Title 42 authority.”
Title 8: ICE principally removes noncitizens from the United States after they have received a final order of removal. These removal operations require complex coordination, management and facilitation efforts to successfully remove and return noncitizens from the United States. ERO accomplishes this mission through charter flights and on commercial airlines for escorted and unescorted removals, in addition to ground transportation missions on the northern and southern borders and at ports of entry.
ERO’s highest-profile removals generally comprise fugitives wanted for serious crimes in other countries, such as homicide, gang-related offenses, corruption and fraud. Often, these individuals come to ERO’s attention because of Interpol notices. Other high-profile removals include known or suspected terrorists, those involved in counterproliferation crimes, and those on the terrorist watch list and no-fly list. War criminals and others convicted or suspected of committing human rights abuses — including torture, ethnic cleansing and genocide — are also in this category. Authorities escort high-profile removals out of the country via commercial flights, regularly scheduled ICE charter flights and special high-risk charters. In many cases, the individuals are turned over to law enforcement authorities in their home country to face charges or sentencing.
Title 42: Title 42 is a public health authority guided by the CDC and is not an immigration authority. On March 21, 2020, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services transferred Title 42 Public Health Authority to CBP. Under Title 42, CBP prohibited the entry of certain people who potentially posed a health risk by being subject to previously announced travel restrictions or having unlawfully entered the country to bypass health screening measures. Under Title 42 authority, DHS rapidly expelled irregular border crossers to their country of last transit — Canada or Mexico — or, when such an expulsion was not possible, interagency partners engaged foreign government officials to secure noncitizens’ expulsion to their countries of origin.

Export Control and Related Border Security Program
BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND NONPROLIFERATION
The Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program seeks to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and destabilizing accumulations and irresponsible transfers of conventional weapons by building effective national strategic trade control systems in countries that possess, produce, or supply strategic items, as well as in countries through which such items are most likely to transit.
In developing and improving these trade and border control systems, we work to ensure conformity with international standards for regulating trade in items on the control lists of the multilateral export control regimes, to prevent the authorization of transfers to end-uses and end-users of proliferation concern, and to detect and interdict illicit transfers at the border. In building countries’ capacity in this critical area, the EXBS program advances U.S. efforts to establish a global WMD detection architecture and helps key partners meet their obligations and commitments pursuant to important U.S. and international initiatives, including UN Security Council Resolution 1540, the Proliferation Security Initiative, the National Security Strategy and adherence to the guidelines of multilateral export control regimes.
The EXBS program works with partner governments to identify regulatory and institutional gaps and to develop resource requirements. The program provides a wide range of technical assistance, from executive exchanges to training workshops to the provision of detection equipment and specialized training for border control and enforcement agencies. The program provides assistance in five core areas:
Laws and Regulations
Licensing
Enforcement
Government-Industry Cooperation
Interagency and International Cooperation and Coordination
The EXBS program draws on the expertise and cooperation of a range of U.S. government agencies, the private sector, and U.S. and international nongovernmental organizations to provide the legal, licensing and enforcement training, along with the necessary information systems and equipment, to put the relevant capabilities into the hands of willing governments.
Interagency Coordination
ISN/ECC has a mandate from the White House to coordinate U.S. Government assistance in the area of export and related border control assistance, and does this primarily through its chairing of the Interagency Working Group on Nonproliferation Export and Border Control Assistance (IWG). Through this mechanism, ISN/ECC coordinates the efforts of other U.S. Government agencies that have independent programs to work in the nonproliferation strategic trade control/border security area in order to ensure an integrated U.S. Government effort.
ECC has taken steps to strengthen interagency coordination by developing an interagency donor strategy that was drafted with input from U.G. Government agencies represented in the IWG.
Several U.S. Government programs, the private sector, academic community, and international organizations participate in implementation of EXBS outreach. For instance, EXBS collaborates with the DOE/INECP in delivery of commodity identification training to partner countries’ border enforcement officials. Further, licensing and enforcement experts from the Department of Commerce, Justice, and Homeland Security contribute their expertise to EXBS activities.

Dewhurst Tasks Lawmakers With Border Security Efforts
Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst on Wednesday charged lawmakers with examining a recent crime enforcement surge effort in the Rio Grande Valley and making recommendations on how to implement similar operations in the future.

Following a three-week initiative led by the Texas Department of Public Safety to combat crime in the Rio Grande Valley, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has called on a state Senate committee to make recommendations on how best to secure the border.
In interim charges to the the Agriculture, Rural Affairs and Homeland Security Committee, Dewhurst asked members to “examine the implementation and effectiveness” of Operation Strong Safety, which between Sept. 15 to Oct. 4 added additional security in the Rio Grande Valley, mainly to combat growing crimes in the region like human and drug trafficking. DPS cited a drop in drug seizures and felony pursuits as a result of the operation.
Dewhurst asked the Senate committee to “make recommendations on options for the improvement and expansion of future surge operations.” 
“With Operation Strong Safety, we have proof of what happens when we apply the right resources to our biggest problems,” Dewhurst said at a press conference Wednesday. “So I’m here today to talk about this operation and what we can do on a continuous surge operation to substantially shut down our border.”
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Dewhurst said he would push to add $60 million worth of border enforcement per year until the border is secure. He said that funding could be approved before the end of the year and that he has called on Gov. Rick Perry and House Speaker Joe Straus to aid with the effort. He added that law enforcement officials have already begun planning how to use those funds so that additional surge operations can be immediately implemented. 
Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at the press conference that future efforts would not include regulatory checkpoints that were used during Operation Strong Safety. The checkpoints provoked public outcry and were mainly effective at reducing driver’s license and insurance violations, as opposed to more dangerous crimes. 
Dewhurst said that the state does not receive adequate support from the federal government in battling border crime and that future state initiatives should serve as an example for the federal government. 
“When we get through with the final price tag, I’m going to send an invoice to President Obama,” Dewhurst said.
Dewhurst also said that current crime statistics don’t truly reflect organized crime throughout the state because they don't include enough data on human and drug trafficking. He charged the Senate committee with studying current crime reporting practices and making recommendations on using other crime reporting systems.

Home News Testimony Written testimony of U.S. Coast Guard for a House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security hearing titled “What Does a Secure Maritime Border Look Like?”
Written testimony of USCG Operations, Deputy for Operations Policy & Capabilities RADM William Lee for a House Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security hearing titled “What Does a Secure Maritime Border Look Like?”
Release Date: November 19, 2013
311 Cannon House Office Building
Introduction
Good morning Madame Chair Miller, Ranking Member Jackson-Lee, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee. I am honored to be here today to discuss the Coast Guard’s role in maritime border security.
The U.S. maritime border is vast and challenging in its scope and diversity. It encompasses the expanse of our ports and internal waters, our Territorial Seas, Contiguous Zone and our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) out to 200 nautical miles from shore and beyond in some cases for Extended Continental Shelf Claims. Threats to our maritime border have the potential to adversely impact our national security and economic prosperity. These threats include illicit smuggling and trafficking activities conducted by Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs), undocumented migration, illegal exploitation of our natural resources, potential terrorist activities, and the disruption of maritime commerce. Securing our maritime borders requires a layered, multi-faceted approach of authorities, capabilities, competencies, and partnerships. To accomplish its mission, the Coast Guard optimizes the use of operational resources, leverages intelligence and maritime domain awareness programs, and fosters domestic and international partnerships. These activities deter, and disrupt threats as far from the United States as possible. The Coast Guard is at the forefront of securing the broad and varied expanse of ocean that makes up our maritime border while facilitating the smooth and efficient flow of legitimate maritime commerce and transportation.
Maritime Domain Awareness
One of the most important aspects of the Coast Guard’s layered security approach is to understand the movement of vessels, people and goods across our maritime borders. By combining security operations with effective governance such as vessel and cargo screening protocols, enforcing notice of arrival requirements and leveraging intelligence and information resources from across government, the Coast Guard facilitates the secure and efficient flow of commerce through our nation’s waterways.
Vessel screening applies analytical criteria to inbound vessels to develop a manageable set of targets for a potential Coast Guard boarding and/or inspection. The Coast Guard screens ships, crews, and passengers for all vessels required to submit a 96-hour Advance Notice of Arrival (ANOA) prior to entering a U.S. port. Complementary screening efforts occur at the national and tactical levels. At the national level, the Intelligence Coordination Center’s Coastwatch Branch, which is co-located with CBP at the National Targeting Center, screens crew and passenger information. Through our partnership with CBP, we have expanded access to counter-terrorism, law enforcement, and immigration databases and this integration has led to greater information sharing and more effective security operations. In 2012, Coastwatch screened approximately 118,000 ANOAs and 29.5 million crew/passenger records.
At the tactical level, each of the Coast Guard’s Area Commanders receives support from a Maritime Intelligence Fusion Center (MIFC), which screens the commercial vessels operating within their areas of responsibility (over 350,000 in 2012) for unique indicators, as well as providing additional screening for vessels that submit an ANOA. The MIFCs focus on screening characteristics associated with the vessels itself, such as ownership, ownership associations, cargo, and previous activity. Coast Guard vessel screening results are disseminated to the appropriate DHS Maritime Interagency Operations Center, Sector Command Center, local intelligence staffs, and CBP and other interagency partners to evaluate and take action on any potential risks.
The Coast Guard also supports the CBP Container Security Initiative, to ensure that all United States-bound maritime shipping containers posing a potential risk are identified and inspected prior to being placed on vessels. This initiative encourages interagency cooperation through collecting and sharing information and trade data gathered from ports, strengthening cooperation and facilitating risk-informed decision making.
Operations to Counter Maritime Risk
Coast Guard cutters, maritime patrol aircraft, and Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) embarked on U.S. Navy and Allied nation vessels are critical enforcement and deterrence assets in the offshore environment. They are capable of responding to threats far from our coasts and maintain a vigilant presence over U.S. interests on the High Seas and in our EEZ. Closer to home, Coast Guard helicopters, patrol boats, and boat stations monitor, track, and interdict vessels of interest. In our ports, the Coast Guard partners with federal, state, local, tribal, and industry stakeholders, to monitor critical infrastructure, conduct vessel escorts and patrols, and inspect vessels and facilities. The Coast Guard’s mix of multi-mission cutters, aircraft, boats, as well as deployable specialized forces, allows us to exercise layered and effective security throughout the maritime domain.
To leverage existing programs, the Coast Guard established formal partnerships to collaborate with CBP on their maritime Predator Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) program (land based), and with the Navy UAS programs. Incorporating the UAS capability with manned patrolling will improve detection and surveillance activities at a significantly reduced cost when compared to manned aviation. During a recent proof of concept deployment aboard USCGC BERTHOLF, the ScanEagle UAS proved to be a superb force multiplier in two separate law enforcement cases, resulting in the removal of 570 kilograms of cocaine and the detention of six suspected smugglers.
When the Coast Guard is alerted to a specific maritime threat to the United States that requires a coordinated U.S. Government response, the Maritime Operational Threat Response (MOTR) Plan is activated. The MOTR Plan uses established protocols and an integrated network of national-level maritime command and operations centers to facilitate real-time federal interagency communication, coordination, and decision-making to ensure a timely, unified and decisive response to maritime threats.
International Partnerships
To detect, deter and counter threats as early as possible, the Coast Guard fosters strategic relationships with partner nations. The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code provides an international regime to ensure ship and port facilities take appropriate preventative measures consistent with our domestic regime under the Maritime Transportation Security Act. Through the International Port Security Program, the Coast Guard conducts foreign port assessments to determine the port security effectiveness and antiterrorism measures of foreign trading partners. Since the inception of the International Port Security Program in 2004, Coast Guard personnel have visited more than 150 countries and approximately 1,200 port facilities. These countries generally receive biennial assessments to verify compliance with the ISPS Code and U.S. maritime security regulations, as appropriate. Vessels arriving in non-ISPS Code compliant countries are required to take additional security precautions while in those ports and may be boarded by the Coast Guard before being granted permission to enter U.S. ports. In specific cases, these vessels may be refused entry.
To more effectively counter maritime threats in the offshore region and throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Coast Guard maintains more than 30 maritime bilateral law enforcement agreements with partner nations. These agreements facilitate coordination of operations and the forward deployment of boats, cutters, aircraft, and personnel to deter and counter threats as close to their origin as possible.
To further address maritime threats and to improve security along with Southwest Border of the United States, the Coast Guard, U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), the Mexican Navy (SEMAR), and the Mexican Secretariat for Communications and Transportation (SCT) have strengthened relations through the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP). Through the SPP, SEMAR and SCT are increasing their engagement with the Coast Guard through training, exercises, coordinated operations, and intelligence and information sharing. Furthermore, the North American Maritime Security Initiative (NAMSI) provides an operational relationship between SEMAR, NORTHCOM, Canadian Forces, and the Coast Guard built upon standard procedures for communications, training, and operations. Since the inception of NAMSI in December 2008, there have been 30 joint narcotics interdiction cases resulting in the seizure of 97,200 pounds of illegal narcotics.
Cooperation and collaboration with Canada remains one of the Coast Guard’s most enduring and effective international partnerships. As outlined in the U.S.-Canada Beyond the Border declaration, border security includes the safety, security, and resiliency of our Nation; the protection of our environmental resources; and the facilitation of the safe and secure movement of commerce in the global supply chain. The Coast Guard is a key part of Integrated Border Enforcement Team (IBET) activities, where U.S. and Canadian agencies share information and expertise to support interdiction operations along our common border. From this partnership, an operational relationship known as Integrated Cross-border Maritime Law Enforcement Operations (ICMLEO), commonly referred to as Shiprider, has emerged. The ICMLEO arrangement spans the shared waterways of U.S./Canadian maritime border, and greatly facilitates cooperative, integrated maritime operations by providing U.S. and Canadian law enforcement officers the authority to conduct joint law enforcement operations on both sides of the border..
Domestic Partnerships
The Coast Guard coordinates and conducts joint operations with other DHS components and interagency partners as part of a whole-of-government response to maritime border threats. Along the Southwest Border, DHS partners continue to apply a broad-based approach to keep communities safe from threats of border-related violence and crime, and to weaken the TCOs that threaten the safety of communities throughout the Western Hemisphere.
In our ports, the Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) is designated as the Federal Maritime Security Coordinator (FMSC). In this role, COTPs lead the Nation’s 43 Area Maritime Security Committees (AMSC) and oversee the development, regular review, and annual exercise of their respective Area Maritime Security Plans (AMSPs). AMSC’s assist and advise the FMSC in the development, review, and implementation of a coordination/communication framework to identify risks and vulnerabilities in and around ports. Additionally, AMSC’s coordinate resources to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from Transportation Security Incidents (TSIs). AMSCs have developed strong working partnerships between all levels of government and private industry stakeholders.
On a national scale, the establishment of Interagency Operations Centers (IOCs) for port security is well underway. In ports such as Charleston, Puget Sound, San Diego, Boston, and Jacksonville, the Coast Guard, CBP, and other agencies are sharing workspace and coordinating operational efforts for improved efficiency and effectiveness of maritime security operations.
The Regional Coordinating Mechanism (ReCoM) is another example of the evolution of coordinated joint operations among interagency partners. Located at San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco the ReCoMs are manned with Coast Guard, CBP, and state and local law enforcement agencies. The San Diego and Los Angeles/Long Beach ReCoMs coordinated operations contributing directly to the interdiction of 1,002 illegal migrants and 210,900 pounds of illegal drugs in FY 2012 and FY 2013.
To counter the drug and migrant smuggling threat in waters off Southern California, the Coast Guard, in partnership with other federal, state, and local agencies increased our levels of effort for the standing Coast Guard Operation Baja Tempestad. This combined operation brings additional resources to the fight against TCOs, including flight deck-equipped cutters with airborne and surface use-of-force capability; increased Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection maritime patrol aircraft flights; additional non-compliant vessel use-of-force endgame capabilities from our shore based boats; and enhanced intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination. In FY 2013, this interagency effort has led to the removal of more than 90,900 pounds of marijuana and the apprehension of 400 illegal migrants.
On the high seas and throughout the six million square mile drug Transit Zone, joint interdiction operations with federal partners are coordinated through Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S) and Joint Interagency Task Force West (JIATF-W). To support detection, monitoring, interdiction, and apprehension operations in the Transit Zone, the Coast Guard leverages maritime assets by forward deploying cutters, patrol aircraft, and Law Enforcement Detachments embarked on U.S. Navy and Allied (British, Dutch, and Canadian) assets. The Coast Guard also works closely with the State and Justice Departments to bring suspected illicit traffickers to the United States for prosecution.
In Puerto Rico, the Coast Guard is part of a broad federal effort to strengthen current joint operations. As the lead federal maritime agency within DHS, the Coast Guard is conducting targeted surge operations in the maritime domain and is collaborating with international stakeholders to stem the flow of illicit drugs into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As a result of these joint efforts, 7,165 kilograms of cocaine and 200 pounds of marijuana were removed in FY 2012 and 24,000 kilograms of cocaine and 9,500 pounds of marijuana were removed in FY 2013.
Conclusion
The Coast Guard’s layered maritime border security strategy addresses the broad range of offshore and coastal threats that have the potential to impact our national security and economic prosperity. From our efforts to expand maritime domain awareness to our international and domestic partnerships, and investments in cutter, boat and aircraft recapitalization, the Coast Guard continues to improve maritime border security while facilitating the safe flow of legitimate commerce.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and thank you for your continued support of the U.S. Coast Guard. I would be pleased to answer your questions.

User Fee, Transponder, and Decal Information
User Fee Decal and Transponder Information
On April 7, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) (P.L. 99-272), which authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to collect user fees for various services. The law initially established processing fees for air and sea passengers, commercial trucks, rail cars, private vessels, dutiable mail packages, and Customs broker permits. The collection of the COBRA fees for Customs services began on July 7, 1986. The User Fee was established to offset inspection costs that were previously funded solely by general taxpayer revenue. For more information please see 19 U.S.C. § 58c Fees For Certain Customs Services.
By law, an agency shall collect a claim of the United States Government for money arising out of its activities, 31 U.S.C. § 3711(a)(1). The Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 C.F.R. Parts 900-904), state that ""Federal agencies shall aggressively collect all debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, that agency. Collection activities shall be undertaken promptly with follow-up action taken as necessary."" 31 C.F.R. § 901.1(a).

You operate a private vessel that is 30 feet or more in length that enters the United States.
In order to qualify as a private vessel requiring a decal, the vessel cannot carry passengers who pay a fare.

Cost of Annual User Fee
Costs of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) User Fees please go to the DTOPS website.
APHIS is responsible for protecting U.S. crops and livestock from pests and diseases and for monitoring and promoting wildlife management and animal welfare. The current proposal published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2007 indicates the removal of Canada's exemption from the APHIS Fee for Commercial Vehicles is scheduled for June 1, 2007.
The User Fee will not be pro-rated for purchases made mid-year.
The User Fee year begins January 1st and ends December 31st. Therefore, all User Fees expire December 31st and are eligible for renewal.
* The User Fee for Private Aircraft and Vessels (30 Feet or over) increased 10% on April 1, 2007 pursuant to the notice published in the Federal Register on Friday, January 26, 2007.
* Vehicles that do not have an annual User Fee will be required to pay a per crossing fee each time the vehicle enters the United States. If the vehicle's User Fee is not renewed, the transponder will continue to transmit information at the port. However, a per-crossing fee will be charged.
Single Crossing Payment
Vehicles are required to pay a per crossing fee if they have not paid an annual fee.  A carrier or their agent can pay the single crossing user fee at the port or can save time by paying in advance prior to arriving at the port.  Click on the picture below to view a video on how to register and pay for the single crossing user fee online.

Commercial Vehicle Information
The transponder, also known as a User Fee, is a sticker that contains a Radio-frequency identification chip (RFID technology) that transmits information about a vehicle and border crossing User Fee payment status.
User Fees are valid for the calendar year only. Transponders have a life span of up to 10 years and remain with the vehicle, even if sold.
Transponders will require replacement when damaged or lost. They also require deactivation from one's fleet when the vehicle is sold. However, transponders are associated with the vehicle's VIN and must remain with the vehicle to which it was assigned.
Vehicle with Transponder
If a vehicle had previously been issued a transponder and the application indicated it was on the vehicle, a new one will not be issued. Once payment for the User Fee has been received, the expiration date on the transponder will be extended to the end of the calendar year for which the User Fee was paid.
If the renewal fee is not paid, the transponder will continue to transmit information at the port. However, a per-crossing fee will be charged.
Vehicle without Transponder
If a vehicle has never been issued a transponder or the application indicated the vehicle's assigned transponder is no longer on the vehicle; a new transponder will be issued once payment for the User Fee has been received. If a transponder is required and is not received with the paperwork, place a replacement order online on the DTOPS website or call or email the User Fee Help Desk at (317) 298-1245 or decals@cbp.dhs.gov. (DTOPS)
Placement of Transponder
Before installing a transponder, thorough cleaning is recommended of the inside of the windshield surface with a high quality glass cleaner that does not leave residue. The transponder is to be placed horizontally on the inside lower left of the truck's windshield at least 2-1/2 inches away from the metallic frame but within a band 4-1/2 inches from the bottom of the windshield and at least 3 inches from any other windshield mounted transponder. Transponders CANNOT be affixed to the wing-windows. Areas with glass curvature should be avoided.
The transponder has one side that is printed with the unique identifying alpha/numeric number. The other side of the transponder is coated with an adhesive. The transponder may be placed on the windshield, adhesive to the glass, so that the printed information is readable from the driver's position. Once applied to the windshield, the transponder is not removable. The transponder should remain on the vehicle for the life of the transponder. Any attempt to remove the transponder after application will render it inoperable.
The transponder should never be placed in a vertical position or in a location where it would obstruct the vision of the driver.
Transponder Replacement
If the issued transponder is non-operational, damaged, or lost, you may request a replacement transponder. To receive a replacement transponder you may place an order on the DTOPS website or fax or mail a request to the decal/transponder program administrator:
U.S. Customs and Border Protection
Attn: DTOPS Program Administrator
6650 Telecom Drive, Suite 100
Indianapolis, IN 46278
Fax: (317) 290-3219
Vehicle Transfers
If a new vehicle joins a fleet and another company has paid the User Fee for the year, choose to transfer that transponder/vehicle to your transportation company. Transfers may only be completed using your online account. A transponder may not be switched between vehicles.
User Fee Exchange for Vehicle
Because a transponder is assigned to a specific conveyance, it cannot be removed and attached to another conveyance. CBP will exchange a User Fee for a different conveyance if a written request is postmarked no later than 30 calendar days after it was issued. The request must also be made prior to a transfer of the renewed conveyance to another company. Only valid requests will be granted.
The following documentation must be submitted for transponder exchanges:
Unused/Used transponder.
Itemized receipt that was sent to you with the transponder.
New application for the vehicle that will be assigned the replacement transponder. New Payment is no longer required.
Signed statement with a brief explanation of the circumstances that required the exchange, including a contact name and telephone number.
* The exception to the 30-day rule: If you purchased a transponder prior to January 1st, it may be exchanged through January 31st of the renewal year.

Decal Information
Decals are stickers that are placed on all private aircraft and private vessels (30 feet or more in length) as proof that the User Fee for entry into the U.S. has been paid for the calendar year. Any arriving vessel or aircraft that does not have an annual decal is required to pay a non-refundable per arrival User Fee of $27.50, and complete an application, which will be forwarded to the processing center. The application will be processed, and a decal will be mailed from the processing center.
Placement of Decals - Private Aircraft or Private Vessels
The User Fee decal for private aircraft and private vessels is to be affixed on the outside of the conveyance within 18 inches of the normal boarding area, where it is visible when doors/hatches are open.
If difficulty is experienced in removing the decal backing, move your thumb repeatedly across a corner of the decal. Attempt each corner.
Decal Replacement
When a vessel or aircraft decal has been damaged due to repair or repainting, the following documents must be submitted no later than 6 months after the decal was issued to obtain a replacement decal:
A copy of the itemized receipt that was sent to you with the decal number assigned.

Written testimony of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton for a House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security hearing titled: “Immigration Enforcement”
Release Date: March 14, 2013
2358-A Rayburn House Office Building
Introduction
Chairman Carter, Ranking Member Price, and members of the Committee: thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to testify about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) immigration enforcement efforts.
Appearing with me today are Dan Ragsdale, ICE’s Deputy Director, and Gary Mead, the head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations. Both men are career employees with distinguished federal service. Mr. Ragsdale has been an ICE attorney, federal prosecutor, and our most recent head of ICE’s Management and Administration. Mr. Mead has served with both the U.S. Marshals Service and ICE, and has run ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) not once, but twice.
Let me exercise a point of personal privilege to thank Gary Mead as he prepares to retire after nearly 40 years of federal service. Running ERO is a weighty and challenging job, and he has done excellent work. Gary has handled himself with a calm professionalism that few could have mustered under the circumstances, and I am deeply grateful as the head of the agency for his decades of service in law enforcement.
ICE’s Immigration Enforcement Successes
Over the past four years, ICE has transformed the immigration enforcement system, smartly focusing resources on the apprehension, detention and removal of individuals who fall within our highest enforcement priorities, namely national security and public safety threats. ICE’s immigration enforcement statistics from the last fiscal year (FY) highlight the Administration’s success in focusing the enforcement system efforts on removing from the country convicted criminals, public safety threats, recent illegal border entrants and other priority individuals. Overall, in FY 2012 ICE’s Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations removed a record number of 409,849 individuals. Of these, approximately 55 percent, or 225,390 of the people removed, were convicted of felonies or misdemeanors – almost double the removal of criminals in FY 2008. This includes 1,215 aliens convicted of homicide; 5,557 aliens convicted of sexual offenses; 40,448 aliens convicted for crimes involving drugs; and 36,166 aliens convicted for driving under the influence. ICE also continues to make progress in the removal of other enforcement priorities. As such, 96 percent of all ICE's removals fell into a priority category – a record high.
In order to maintain control at our nation’s borders, ICE prioritizes the identification and removal of recent border crossers and conducts targeted enforcement operations with the U.S. Border Patrol. Attempts to cross the Southwest border illegally have decreased 49 percent over the past four years, and are 78 percent lower than what they were at their peak. In many ways, these historic results along the Southwest Border are attributable to the joint efforts of U.S. Border Patrol agents and ICE officers and agents, and the emphasis ICE places on the removal of recent border crossers.
ICE has been implementing a range of smart, effective reforms to the immigration system that allow our agency to focus its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a danger to national security, a risk to public safety, or otherwise represent enforcement priorities. ICE has established formal written prosecutorial discretion guidance for ICE law enforcement personnel and attorneys regarding their authority to exercise discretion when appropriate. The relevant directives clearly state that the exercise of discretion is inappropriate in cases involving individuals who pose a clear risk to national security; serious felons, repeat offenders, or individuals with a lengthy criminal record of any kind; known gang members or other individuals who pose a clear danger to public safety; and individuals with an egregious record of immigration violations. This guidance also directs the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion to ensure that victims of and witnesses to crimes are properly protected.
To further enhance ICE’s prioritized approach, on December 21, 2012, ICE issued new guidance to state and local law enforcement partners governing the use of detainers in our nation’s criminal justice system. The guidance sets forth a uniform, transparent and effective manner for regulating their use in cases arising out of the Criminal Alien Program, Secure Communities, 287(g) agreements, and other ICE enforcement efforts. Moreover, consistent with ICE enforcement priorities, the guidance outlines the types of cases where detainers should be issued. These include cases involving felony convictions or felony charges; three or more prior misdemeanor convictions; misdemeanors involving violence, sexual abuse or other serious conduct; or cases that pose significant risks to national security, border security, or public safety. Conversely, the new policy limits their use in cases involving individuals arrested for minor misdemeanor offenses such as traffic offenses, which do not reflect a danger to public safety, and will help to ensure that available resources are focused on apprehending convicted felons, repeat immigration offenders and other ICE priorities. It is applicable to all ICE enforcement programs and strategies. ICE will continue to evaluate its enforcement policies, operations and programs to ensure that they are focused on our highest priorities, making adjustments when necessary.
Also reflective of ICE’s commitment to smart, effective immigration enforcement are the major reforms we have made to the immigration detention system. Beginning in August 2009, these reforms address many of the concerns raised about ICE’s immigration detention system, while allowing ICE to maintain adequate detention capacity to carry out our immigration enforcement responsibilities. To help effectuate these reforms, in 2009, ICE established its Office of Detention Policy and Planning, which oversees day-to-day detention reforms while designing a new detention system that aligns with our nation’s values. ICE also conducted a nationwide deployment of a new automated Risk Classification Assessment instrument to improve transparency and uniformity in detention custody and classification decisions reflecting the agency's civil enforcement priorities, this assessment contains objective criteria to guide decision making, regarding whether an alien should be detained or released, and if detained, the alien's appropriate custody classification level. It also requires ICE officers to determine whether there is any special vulnerability that may impact custody and classification determinations. ICE continues to look for ways to ensure that the health and safety of aliens in our custody are protected, by increasing our oversight of detention facilities and improving the conditions of confinement within the detention system.
All of the above successes highlight the effectiveness ICE’s overall effort to establish clear enforcement priorities that smartly focus agency resources.
Recent Releases of Certain Aliens
As the Committee knows, we are coming to the end of a Continuing Resolution (CR). This CR funded ICE to maintain a yearly average daily population of approximately 34,000 individuals. In early February, ICE was maintaining an average daily population in excess of 35,000 individuals, including many who did not require detention by law.
These detention levels exceeded Congressional appropriations, and with the strong possibility of sequestration, ICE officials managed the detention population in order to ensure that ICE could operate within the appropriations provided by Congress.. Notably, these budget constraints are now further compounded by the reductions required by sequestration, which represents a nearly $300 million cut to our budget that we must absorb over the remaining seven months of the fiscal year.
In reducing detention levels, we took careful steps to ensure that national security and public safety were not compromised by the releases. All release decisions were made by career law enforcement officials following a careful examination of the individual’s criminal and immigration history ensuring that the focus remains on detaining serious criminal offenders and others who pose a threat to the national security or public safety. Every individual released was placed on an alternative form of ICE’s supervision, and all released individuals remain in removal proceedings.
I regret that the timing of our releases caught many by surprise and we would be happy to brief your staffs further on this issue. The releases were a direct result of ICE’s efforts to stay within its detention budget in light of the CR and sequestration. Going forward, ICE will continue to manage its budget in a prioritized manner, ensuring that the focus remains on serious criminal offenders and others who pose a threat to public safety.
Conclusion
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I would now be pleased to answer any questions.

Written testimony of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton for a House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security hearing titled: “Immigration Enforcement”
Release Date: March 14, 2013
2358-A Rayburn House Office Building
Introduction
Chairman Carter, Ranking Member Price, and members of the Committee: thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to testify about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) immigration enforcement efforts.
Appearing with me today are Dan Ragsdale, ICE’s Deputy Director, and Gary Mead, the head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations. Both men are career employees with distinguished federal service. Mr. Ragsdale has been an ICE attorney, federal prosecutor, and our most recent head of ICE’s Management and Administration. Mr. Mead has served with both the U.S. Marshals Service and ICE, and has run ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) not once, but twice.
Let me exercise a point of personal privilege to thank Gary Mead as he prepares to retire after nearly 40 years of federal service. Running ERO is a weighty and challenging job, and he has done excellent work. Gary has handled himself with a calm professionalism that few could have mustered under the circumstances, and I am deeply grateful as the head of the agency for his decades of service in law enforcement.

Red Teams
Red Team exercises are pre-planned, unannounced exercises conducted in each of New York's 16 Counter Terrorism Zones (CTZs) by law enforcement and homeland security personnel, who engage in ""suspicious activity"" to ""test"" whether the state's ""See Something Say Something"" message is reaching owners and operators for critical infrastructure and certain business sectors. Locations to be tested and scenarios are determined based on the current threat environment and intelligence reports, in conjunction with federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement. The goal of the Red Teams is to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of New York State's suspicious activity reporting programs, encourage facility security and target hardening, and promote citizen awareness. Red Teams significantly strengthen statewide partnerships between OCT, law enforcement, local communities, and the private sector.

 Video Surveillance Access Database
What is the Video Surveillance Access Database?
On January 28, 2013, a new law became effective in the State of New York that allows residential homeowners and business owners to voluntarily register their video surveillance cameras for use by law enforcement agencies for the purposes of a criminal investigation. The program allows residential homeowners and businesses to register their video surveillance equipment through an online form.
Surveillance Camera Registration Form

If I am registered, will the general public be able to see my personal information?
No, all information is held confidential, and your information will only be used for internal Division of Homeland Security & Emergency Services (DHSES) official business and will only be shared with law enforcement, upon request, for purposes of a criminal investigation.

How will law enforcement be able to access my information? Will I be contacted by DHSES or law enforcement?
A law enforcement agent conducting a criminal investigation will request information on any video surveillance cameras that may be registered that relates to a criminal investigation. With that information the law enforcement agent will then contact those individuals to ask for permission to view, use and/or borrow the video surveillance images. The law enforcement agent will make the request through an established Division of Criminal Justice Services process.

What if I no longer wish to be registered? Can I remove my information?
At any point in time, the residential homeowner or business may withdraw their information from the video surveillance access database by completing the withdrawal form. Please allow 5 business days to complete the withdrawal process.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
NOTE: Please visit the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website for the most current information on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)
---
Over the past three years, this Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to transform the immigration enforcement system into one that focuses on public safety, border security and the integrity of the immigration system. As the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to focus its enforcement resources on the removal of individuals who pose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety, including individuals convicted of crimes with particular emphasis on violent criminals, felons, and repeat offenders, DHS will exercise prosecutorial discretion as appropriate to ensure that enforcement resources are not expended on low priority cases, such as individuals who came to the United States as children and meet other key guidelines.  Individuals who demonstrate that they meet the guidelines below may request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals for a period of two years, subject to renewal, and may be eligible for employment authorization.
You may request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals if you:
Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012;
Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;
Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time;
Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making your request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS;
Entered without inspection before June 15, 2012, or your lawful immigration status expired as of June 15, 2012;
Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general education development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; and
Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.
Individuals can call USCIS at 1-800-375-5283 with questions or to request more information on the deferred action for childhood arrivals process or visit www.uscis.gov.
Frequently Asked Questions
About Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
Q1: What is deferred action?
A1:Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. Deferred action does not confer lawful status upon an individual. In addition, although an individual whose case is deferred will not be considered to be accruing unlawful presence in the United States during the period deferred action is in effect, deferred action does not excuse individuals of any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence.
Under existing regulations, an individual whose case has been deferred is eligible to receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action, provided he or she can demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.” DHS can terminate or renew deferred action at any time at the agency’s discretion.
Q2: What is deferred action for childhood arrivals?
A2: On June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several key guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal, and would then be eligible for work authorization.
Individuals who can demonstrate through verifiable documentation that they meet these guidelines will be considered for deferred action. Determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis under the guidelines set forth in the Secretary of Homeland Security’s memorandum.
Q3: If my removal is deferred pursuant to the consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals process, am I eligible for employment authorization?
A3: Yes. Pursuant to existing regulations, if your case is deferred, you may obtain employment authorization from USCIS provided you can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. 
Q4: Does this process apply to me if I am currently in removal proceedings, have a final removal order, or have a voluntary departure order?
A4: This process is open to any individual who can demonstrate he or she meets the guidelines for consideration, including those who have never been in removal proceedings as well as those in removal proceedings, with a final order, or with a voluntary departure order (as long as they are not in immigration detention). If you are not in immigration detention and want to affirmatively request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, you must submit your request to USCIS – not ICE – pursuant to the procedures outlined below. If you are currently in immigration detention and believe you meet the guidelines you should not request consideration of deferred action from USCIS but should identify yourself to your detention officer or contact the ICE Office of the Public Advocate through the Office’s hotline at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., Monday – Friday) or by email at EROPublicAdvocate@ice.dhs.gov(link sends email).
Q5: Do I accrue unlawful presence if I have a pending request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals?
A5: You will continue to accrue unlawful presence while the request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals is pending, unless you are under 18 years old at the time of the request. If you are under 18 years old at the time you submit your request but turn 18 while your request is pending with USCIS, you will not accrue unlawful presence while the request is pending. If your case is deferred, you will not accrue unlawful presence during the period of deferred action. Having action deferred on your case will not excuse previously accrued unlawful presence.
Q6: If my case is deferred, am I in lawful status for the period of deferral?
A6: No. Although action on your case has been deferred and you do not accrue unlawful presence during the period of deferred action, deferred action does not confer any lawful status. 
There is a significant difference between “unlawful presence” and “unlawful status.” Unlawful presence refers to a period an individual is present in the United States (1) without being admitted or paroled or (2) after the expiration of a period of stay authorized by the Department of Homeland Security (such as after the period of stay authorized by a visa has expired). Unlawful presence is relevant only with respect to determining whether the inadmissibility bars for unlawful presence, set forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act at Section 212(a)(9), apply to an individual if he or she departs the United States and subsequently seeks to re-enter. (These unlawful presence bars are commonly known as the 3- and 10-Year Bars.) 
 
The fact that you are not accruing unlawful presence does not change whether you are in lawful status while you remain in the United States.  Because you lack lawful status at the time DHS defers action in your case, you remain subject to all legal restrictions and prohibitions on individuals in unlawful status.
Q7: Does deferred action provide me with a path to permanent residence status or citizenship?
A7: No. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion that does not confer lawful permanent resident status or a path to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.
Q8: If my case is deferred, will I be eligible for premium tax credits and reduced cost sharing through Affordable Insurance Exchanges starting in 2014?
A8: No.  The Departments of Health and Human Services and the Treasury intend to conform the relevant regulations to the extent necessary to exempt individuals with deferred action for childhood arrivals from eligibility for premium tax credits and reduced cost sharing.  This is consistent with the policy under S. 3992, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act of 2010. 
Q9: Can I be considered for deferred action even if I do not meet the guidelines to be considered for deferred action for childhood arrivals?
A9:This process is only for individuals who meet the specific guidelines announced by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Other individuals may, on a case-by-case basis, request deferred action from USCIS or ICE in certain circumstances, consistent with longstanding practice.
Q10: Will the information I share in my request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals be used for immigration enforcement purposes?
A10: Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear or a referral to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the criteria set forth in USCIS’s Notice to Appear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).  Individuals whose cases are deferred pursuant to the consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals process will not be referred to ICE. The information may be shared with national security and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for assistance in the consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals request, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense. The above information sharing policy covers family members and guardians, in addition to the requestor. 
This policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.
Q11: If my case is referred to ICE for immigration enforcement purposes or if I receive an NTA, will information related to my family members and guardians also be referred to ICE for immigration enforcement purposes?
A11: If your case is referred to ICE for purposes of immigration enforcement or you receive an NTA, information related to your family members or guardians that is contained in your request will not be referred to ICE for purposes of immigration enforcement against family members or guardians. However, that information may be shared with national security and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for assistance in the consideration of the deferred action for childhood arrivals request, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.
This policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.
Q12: Does this Administration remain committed to comprehensive immigration reform?
A12: Yes. The Administration has consistently pressed for passage of comprehensive immigration reform, including the DREAM Act, because the President believes these steps are critical to building a 21st century immigration system that meets our nation’s economic and security needs.
Q13: Is passage of the DREAM Act still necessary in light of the new process?
A13: Yes. The Secretary of Homeland Security’s June 15th memorandum allowing certain people to request consideration for deferred action is the most recent in a series of steps that DHS has taken to focus its enforcement resources on the removal of individuals who pose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety. Deferred action does not provide lawful status or a pathway to citizenship. As the President has stated, individuals who would qualify for the DREAM Act deserve certainty about their status. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer the certainty that comes with a pathway to permanent lawful status.
Q14: Can I request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals under this process if I am currently in a nonimmigrant status (e.g. F-1, E-2, H-4) or have Temporary Protected Status (TPS)?
A14: No. You can only request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals under this process if you currently have no immigration status and were not in any lawful status on June 15, 2012.
Guidelines for Requesting Consideration of Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals
Q1: What guidelines must I meet to be considered for deferred action for childhood arrivals?
A1: Pursuant to the Secretary of Homeland Security’s June 15, 2012 memorandum, in order to be considered for deferred action for childhood arrivals, you must submit evidence, including support documents, showing that you:
Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012;
Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;
Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time;
Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making your request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS;
Entered without inspection before June 15, 2012, or your lawful immigration status expired as of June 15, 2012;
Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a General Education Development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; and;
Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.
These guidelines must be met for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals. USCIS retains the ultimate discretion on whether deferred action is appropriate in any given case.
Q2: How old must I be in order to be considered for deferred action under this process?
A2:
If you have never been in removal proceedings, or your proceedings have been terminated before your request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, you must be at least 15 years of age or older at the time of filing and meet the other guidelines.
If you are in removal proceedings, have a final removal order, or have a voluntary departure order, and are not in immigration detention, you can request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals even if you are under the age of 15 at the time of filing and meet the other guidelines. 
In all instances, you cannot be the age of 31 or older as of June 15, 2012, to be considered for deferred action for childhood arrivals.
Education
Q1: Does “currently in school” refer to the date on which the request for consideration of deferred action is filed?
A1: To be considered “currently in school” under the guidelines, you must be enrolled in school on the date you submit a request for consideration of deferred action under this process. 
Q2: Who is considered to be “currently in school” under the guidelines?
A2: To be considered “currently in school” under the guidelines, you must be enrolled in:
a public or private elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, or secondary school;
an education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; or
an education program assisting students either in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law (including a certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or alternate award), or in passing a General Educational Development (GED) exam or other equivalent state-authorized exam.
Such education, literacy, or career training programs include, but are not limited to, programs funded, in whole or in part, by federal or state grants. Programs funded by other sources may qualify if they are administered by providers of demonstrated effectiveness, such as institutions of higher education, including community colleges, and certain community-based organizations.
In assessing whether such an education, literacy or career training program not funded in whole or in part by federal or state grants is of demonstrated effectiveness, USCIS will consider the duration of the program’s existence; the program’s track record in assisting students in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, in passing a GED or other state-authorized exam, or in placing students in postsecondary education, job training, or employment; and other indicators of the program’s overall quality. For individuals seeking to demonstrate that they are “currently in school” through enrollment in such a program, the burden is on the requestor to show the program’s demonstrated effectiveness.
Q3: How do I establish that I am currently in school?
A3: Documentation sufficient for you to demonstrate that you are currently in school may include, but is not limited to:
evidence that you are enrolled in a public or private elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school or secondary school; or
evidence that you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement, and that the program is funded in whole or in part by federal or state grants or is of demonstrated effectiveness; or
evidence that you are enrolled in an education program assisting students either in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under State law (including a certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or alternate award), or in passing a General Educational Development (GED) exam or other such state-authorized exam, and that the program is funded in whole or in part by federal or state grants or is of demonstrated effectiveness.
Such evidence of enrollment may include: acceptance letters, school registration cards, letters from school or program, transcripts, report cards, or progress reports showing the name of the school or program, date of enrollment, and current educational or grade level, if relevant. 
 
Q4: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have graduated from high school?
A4: Documentation sufficient for you to demonstrate that you have graduated from high school may include, but is not limited to, a high school diploma from a public or private high school or secondary school, or a recognized equivalent of a high school diploma under state law, including a General Education Development (GED) certificate, certificate of completion, a certificate of attendance, or an alternate award from a public or private high school or secondary school.
Q5: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have obtained a General Education Development (GED)?
A5: Documentation sufficient for you to demonstrate that you have obtained a GED may include, but is not limited to, evidence that you have passed a GED exam, or other comparable state-authorized exam, and, as a result, you have received the recognized equivalent of a regular high school diploma under state law.
Q6: If I am enrolled in a literacy or career training program, can I meet the guidelines?
A6: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may meet the guidelines if you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program that is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement. Such programs include, but are not limited to, programs funded by federal or state grants, or administered by providers of demonstrated effectiveness.
Q7: If I am enrolled in an English as a Second Language (ESL) program, can I meet the guidelines?
A7: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may meet the guidelines only if you are enrolled in an ESL program as a prerequisite for your placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement. You must submit direct documentary evidence that your participation in the ESL program is connected to your placement in postsecondary education, job training or employment and that the program is one of demonstrated effectiveness.
Q8: Will USCIS consider circumstantial evidence that I have met the education guidelines?
A8: No. Circumstantial evidence will not be accepted to establish that you are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, or have obtained a general education development certificate. You must submit direct documentary evidence to satisfy that you meet the education guidelines.
Q9: If I am currently in school and USCIS defers action in my case, what will I have to demonstrate if I request that USCIS renew the deferral after two years?
A9: If you are in school at the time of your request and your case is deferred by USCIS, in order to have your request for an extension considered, you must show at the time of the request for renewal either (1) that you have graduated from the school in which you were enrolled and, if that school was elementary school or junior high or middle school, you have made substantial, measurable progress toward graduating from high school, or, (2) you have made substantial, measurable progress toward graduating from the school in which you are enrolled.
If you are currently in an education program that assists students either in obtaining a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law, or in passing a GED exam or other equivalent state-authorized exam, and your case is deferred by USCIS, in order to have your request for an extension considered, you must show at the time of the request for renewal that you have obtained a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent or that you have passed a GED or other equivalent state-authorized exam.
If you are currently enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment, and your case is deferred by USCIS, in order to have your request for an extension considered, you must show at the time of the request for renewal that you are enrolled in postsecondary education, that you have obtained the employment for which you were trained, or that you have made substantial, measurable progress toward completing the program.
Specific details on the renewal process will be made available at a later date.
Travel Guidelines
Q1: Do brief departures from the United States interrupt the continuous residence requirement?
A1: A brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States will not interrupt your continuous residence. If you were absent from the United States for any period of time, your absence will be considered brief, casual, and innocent, if it was before August 15, 2012, and:
The absence was short and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose for the absence;
The absence was not because of an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;
The absence was not because of an order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary departure before you were placed in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings; and
The purpose of the absence and/or your actions while outside the United States were not contrary to law.
Q2: May I travel outside of the United States before USCIS has determined whether to defer action in my case?
A2: No.  After August 15, 2012, if you travel outside of the United States, you will not be considered for deferred action under this process. If USCIS defers action in your case, you will be permitted to travel outside of the United States only if you apply for and receive advance parole from USCIS.
Any travel outside of the United States that occurred before August 15, 2012, will be assessed by USCIS to determine whether the travel qualifies as brief, casual and innocent (see above).
Note:  If you have been ordered deported or removed, and you then leave the United States, your departure may result in your being considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.
Travel Guidelines

Yes. You cannot travel while your request is under review.
You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case.
Q3: If my case is deferred pursuant to the consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals process, will I be able to travel outside of the United States?
A3: Not automatically. If USCIS has decided to defer action in your case and you want to travel outside the United States, you must apply for advance parole by filing a Form I-131, Application for Travel Document and paying the applicable fee ($360). USCIS will determine whether your purpose for international travel is justifiable based on the circumstances you describe in your request. Generally, USCIS will only grant advance parole if you are traveling for humanitarian purposes, educational purposes, or employment purposes. You may not apply for advance parole unless and until USCIS defers action in your case pursuant to the consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals process. You cannot apply for advance parole at the same time as you submit your request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals. All advance parole requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
If USCIS has deferred action in your case under the deferred action for childhood arrivals process after you have been ordered deported or removed, you may still request advance parole if you meet the guidelines for advance parole described above. However, once you have received advance parole, and before you actually leave the United States, you should seek to reopen your case before the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and obtain administrative closure or termination of your removal proceeding.  Even after you have asked EOIR to reopen your case, you should not leave the United States until after EOIR has granted your request. If you depart after being ordered deported or removed, and your removal proceeding has not been reopened and administratively closed or terminated, your departure may result in your being considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.  If you have any questions about this process, you may call the ICE Office of the Public Advocate through the Office’s hotline at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., Monday – Friday) or by email at EROPublicAdvocate@ice.dhs.gov(link sends email).
National Security and Public Safety
Q1: If I have a conviction for a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanors, can I receive an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under this new process?
A1: No. If you have been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or three or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct, you will not be considered for deferred action under the new process except where DHS determines there are exceptional circumstances.
Q2: What offenses qualify as a felony?
A2:A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.
Q3: What offenses constitute a significant misdemeanor?
A3: For the purposes of this process, a significant misdemeanor is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, one for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is one year or less but greater than five days) and that meets the following criteria:
Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or, driving under the influence; or,
If not an offense listed above, is one for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and therefore does not include a suspended sentence.
The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Notwithstanding the above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary one that is made taking into account the totality of the circumstances. Therefore, the absence of the criminal history outlined above, or its presence, is not necessarily determinative, but is a factor to be considered in the unreviewable exercise of discretion. DHS retains the discretion to determine that an individual does not warrant deferred action on the basis of a single criminal offense for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less.
Q4: What offenses constitute a non-significant misdemeanor?
A4: For purposes of this process, a non-significant misdemeanor is any misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, one for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is one year or less but greater than five days) and that meets the following criteria:
Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or, driving under the influence; and
Is one for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less. The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE. 
Notwithstanding the above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary one that is made taking into account the totality of the circumstances.  Therefore, the absence of the criminal history outlined above, or its presence, is not necessarily determinative, but is a factor to be considered in the unreviewable exercise of discretion. 
Q5: If I have a minor traffic offense, such as driving without a license, will it be considered a non-significant misdemeanor that counts towards the “three or more non-significant misdemeanors” making me unable to receive consideration for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under this new process?
A5: A minor traffic offense will not be considered a misdemeanor for purposes of this process. However, your entire offense history can be considered along with other facts to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, you warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. 
It is important to emphasize that driving under the influence is a significant misdemeanor regardless of the sentence imposed.
Q6: Will offenses criminalized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws be considered felonies or misdemeanors for purpose of this process?
A6: No.  Immigration-related offenses characterized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws will not be treated as disqualifying felonies or misdemeanors for the purpose of considering a request for consideration of deferred action pursuant to this process.
Q7: Will DHS consider my expunged or juvenile conviction as an offense making me unable to receive an exercise of prosecutorial discretion?
A7: Expunged convictions and juvenile convictions will not automatically disqualify you. Your request will be assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, under the particular circumstances, a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion is warranted. If you were a juvenile, but tried and convicted as an adult, you will be treated as an adult for purposes of the deferred action for childhood arrivals process.
Q8: What qualifies as a national security or public safety threat?
A8: If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request for deferred action indicates that your presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security, you will not be able to receive consideration for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion except where DHS determines there are exceptional circumstances. Indicators that you pose such a threat include, but are not limited to, gang membership, participation in criminal activities, or participation in activities that threaten the United States.
Q9: If I am not in removal proceedings but believe I meet the guidelines for an exercise of deferred action under this process, should I seek to place myself into removal proceedings through encounters with CBP or ICE?
A9: No. If you are not in removal proceedings but believe that you meet the guidelines you should submit your request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals to USCIS under the process outlined below.
Filing Process
Q1: How do I request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals?
A1:To request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals from USCIS, you must submit Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to USCIS. This form must be completed, properly signed and accompanied by a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and a Form I-765WS, Worksheet, establishing your economic need for employment. If you fail to submit a completed Form I-765 (along with the accompanying filing fees for that form, totaling $465), USCIS will not consider your request for deferred action. Please read the form instructions to ensure that you submit all the required documentation to support your request. 
 
You must file your request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals at the USCIS Lockbox. You can find the mailing address and instructions on www.uscis.gov/i-821d. After your Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765 Worksheet have been received, USCIS will review them for completeness, including submission of the required fee, initial evidence and supporting documents. If it is determined that the request is complete, USCIS will send you a receipt notice. USCIS will then send you an appointment notice to visit an Application Support Center (ASC) for biometric services. Please make sure you read and follow the directions in the notice. Failure to attend your biometrics appointment may delay processing of your request for consideration of deferred action, or may result in a denial of your request. You may also choose to receive an email and/or text message notifying you that your form has been accepted by completing a Form G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance.
Each request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals will be reviewed on an individual, case-by-case basis. USCIS may request more information or evidence from you, or request that you appear at a USCIS office. USCIS will notify you of its determination in writing.
Note: All individuals who believe they meet the guidelines, including those in removal proceedings, with a final removal order, or with a voluntary departure order (and not in immigration detention), may affirmatively request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals from USCIS through this process. Individuals who are currently in immigration detention and believe they meet the guidelines may not request consideration of deferred action from USCIS but may identify themselves to their detention officer or to the ICE Office of the Public Advocate through the Office’s hotline at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., Monday – Friday) or by email at EROPublicAdvocate@ice.dhs.gov(link sends email).
Q2: Will USCIS conduct a background check when reviewing my request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals?
A2: Yes. You must undergo biographic and biometric background checks before USCIS will consider whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion under the consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals process. If you have been convicted of any felony, a significant misdemeanor offense, three or more misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct, or otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety, you will not be considered for deferred action for childhood arrivals except where DHS determines there are exceptional circumstances.
Q3: What do background checks involve?
A3: Background checks involve checking biographic and biometric information provided by the individuals against a variety of databases maintained by DHS and other federal government agencies.
Q4: Can I obtain a fee waiver or fee exemption for this process?
A4: There are no fee waivers available for employment authorization applications connected to the deferred action for childhood arrivals process. There are very limited fee exemptions available. Requests for fee exemptions must be filed and favorably adjudicated before an individual files his/her request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals without a fee. In order to be considered for a fee exemption, you must submit a letter and supporting documentation to USCIS demonstrating that you meet one of the following conditions:
You are under 18 years of age, homeless, in foster care or under 18 years of age and otherwise lacking any parental or other familial support, and your income is less than 150% of the U.S. poverty level.
You cannot care for yourself because you suffer from a serious, chronic disability and your income is less than 150% of the U.S. poverty level.
You have, at the time of the request, accumulated $25,000 or more in debt in the past 12 months as a result of unreimbursed medical expenses for yourself or an immediate family member, and your income is less than 150% of the U.S. poverty level.
Additional information on how to make your request for a fee exemption is available on www.uscis.gov/childhoodarrivals. Your request must be submitted and decided before you submit a request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals without a fee. In order to be considered for a fee exemption, you must provide documentary evidence to demonstrate that you meet any of the above conditions at the time that you make the request. For evidence, USCIS will:
Accept affidavits from community-based or religious organizations to establish a requestor’s homelessness or lack of parental or other familial financial support.
Accept copies of tax returns, banks statement, pay stubs, or other reliable evidence of income level. Evidence can also include an affidavit from the applicant or a responsible third party attesting that the applicant does not file tax returns, has no bank accounts, and/or has no income to prove income level.
Accept copies of medical records, insurance records, bank statements, or other reliable evidence of unreimbursed medical expenses of at least $25,000.
Address factual questions through requests for evidence (RFEs).
Q5: Will there be supervisory review of decisions by USCIS under this process?
A5: Yes. USCIS will implement a supervisory review process in all four Service Centers to ensure a consistent process for considering requests for deferred action for childhood arrivals. USCIS will require officers to elevate for supervisory review those cases that involve certain factors.
Q6: Will USCIS personnel responsible for reviewing requests for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under this process receive special training?
A6: Yes. USCIS personnel responsible for considering requests for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals will receive special training.
Q7. Must attorneys and accredited representatives who provide pro bono services to deferred action requestors at group assistance events file a Form G-28 with USCIS?
A7. An attorney or accredited representative who provides pro bono assistance to an individual in a workshop setting and who intends to represent the individual after the workshop must file a Form G-28.  An attorney or accredited representative who provides pro bono assistance to an individual in a workshop setting, but who does not intend to represent the individual after the workshop, should assess the extent of the relationship with the individual and the nature and type of the assistance provided.  On that basis, the attorney or accredited representative should determine whether to file a Form G-28.  If a Form G-28 is not filed, the attorney or accredited representative should determine whether it would be appropriate under the circumstances to provide the individual and USCIS with a letter noting the limited extent of the representation.
Q8. When must an individual sign a Form I-821D as a preparer?
A8. If someone other than the requestor prepares or helps fill out the Form I-821D, that individual must complete Part 5 of the Form.
Q9. How should I fill out question nine (9) on the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization?
A9. When you are filing a Form I-765 as part of a Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals request, question nine (9) is asking you to list those Social Security numbers that were officially issued to you by the Social Security Administration.
Decisions and Renewals
Q1: Can I appeal USCIS’s determination?
A1: No. You cannot file a motion to reopen or reconsider, and cannot appeal the decision if USCIS denies your request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals. USCIS will not review its discretionary determinations. You may request a review using the Service Request Management Tool (SRMT) process if you met all of the process guidelines and you believe that your request was denied due to one of the following errors:
USCIS denied the request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals based on abandonment and you claim that you did respond to a Request for Evidence within the prescribed time; or
USCIS mailed the Request for Evidence to the wrong address, even though you had submitted a Form AR-11, Change of Address, or changed your address online at www.uscis.gov before the issuance of the Request for Evidence.
Q2: If USCIS does not exercise deferred action in my case, will I be placed in removal proceedings?
A2: If you have submitted a request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals and USCIS decides not to defer action in your case, USCIS will apply its policy guidance governing the referral of cases to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the issuance of Notices to Appear (NTA). If your case does not involve a criminal offense, fraud, or a threat to national security or public safety, your case will not be referred to ICE for purposes of removal proceedings except where DHS determines there are exceptional circumstances. For more detailed information on the applicable NTA policy visit www.uscis.gov/NTA. If after a review of the totality of circumstances USCIS determines to defer action in your case, USCIS will likewise exercise its discretion and will not issue you a Notice to Appear.
Q3: Can I extend the period of deferred action in my case?
A3: Yes. Unless terminated, individuals whose case is deferred pursuant to the consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals process will not be placed into removal proceedings or removed from the United States for a period of two years. You may request consideration for an extension of that period of deferred action. As long as you were not above the age of 30 on June 15, 2012, you may request a renewal after turning 31. Your request for an extension will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Q4: If my period of deferred action is extended, will I need to re-apply for an extension of my employment authorization?
A4: Yes. If USCIS decides to defer action for additional periods beyond the initial two years, you must also have requested an extension of your employment authorization.

Q1: May I file affidavits as proof that I meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals?
A1: Affidavits generally will not be sufficient on their own to demonstrate that you meet the guidelines for USCIS to consider you for deferred action for childhood arrivals. 
However, affidavits may be used to support meeting the following guidelines only if the documentary evidence available to you is insufficient or lacking:
A gap in the documentation demonstrating that you meet the five year continuous residence requirement; and
A shortcoming in documentation with respect to the brief, casual and innocent departures during the five years of required continuous presence.
If you submit affidavits related to the above criteria, you must submit two or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself, who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances. Should USCIS determine that the affidavits are insufficient to overcome the unavailability or the lack of documentary evidence with respect to either of these guidelines, it will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating that further evidence must be submitted to demonstrate that you meet these guidelines.
 
USCIS will not accept affidavits as proof of satisfying the following guidelines:
You are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general education development certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran from the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States;
You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;
You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;
You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012; and
Your criminal history, if applicable.
If the only evidence you submit to demonstrate you meet any of the above guidelines is an affidavit, USCIS will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating that you have not demonstrated that you meet these guidelines and that you must do so in order to demonstrate that you meet that guideline.
Q2: Will USCIS consider circumstantial evidence that I have met certain guidelines?
A2: Circumstantial evidence may be used to establish the following guidelines and factual showings if available documentary evidence is insufficient or lacking and shows that:
You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;
You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;
You satisfy the five year continuous residence requirement, as long as you present direct evidence of your continued residence in the United States for a portion of the required five-year period and the circumstantial evidence is used only to fill in gaps in the length of continuous residence demonstrated by the direct evidence; and
Any travel outside the United States during the five years of required continuous presence was brief, casual, and innocent.
However, USCIS will not accept circumstantial evidence as proof of any of the following guidelines to demonstrate that you:
Were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012; and
Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a General Education Development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States.
For example, if you do not have documentary proof of your presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, you may nevertheless be able to satisfy the guideline circumstantially by submitting credible documentary evidence that you were present in the United States shortly before and shortly after June 15, 2012, which under the facts presented may give rise to an inference of your presence on June 15, 2012 as well. However, circumstantial evidence will not be accepted to establish that you have graduated high school. You must submit direct documentary evidence to satisfy that you meet this guideline.
Q3. To prove my continuous residence in the United States since June 15, 2007, must I provide evidence documenting my presence for every day, or every month, of that period?
A3. To meet the continuous residence guideline, you must submit documentation that shows you have been living in the United States from June 15, 2007 up until the time of your request.  You should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence.  It is helpful to USCIS if you can submit evidence of your residence during at least each year of the period.  USCIS will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether it is more likely than not that you were continuously residing in the United States for the period since June 15, 2007.  Gaps in the documentation as to certain periods may raise doubts as to your continued residence if, for example, the gaps are lengthy or the record otherwise indicates that you may have been outside the United States for a period of time that was not brief, casual or innocent.  If  gaps in your documentation raise questions , USCIS may issue a request for evidence to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous residence. 
Affidavits may be submitted to explain a gap in the documentation demonstrating that you meet the five year continuous residence requirement.  If you submit affidavits related to the continuous residence requirement, you must submit two or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself, who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances during the period as to which there is a gap in the documentation.  Affidavits may only be used to explain gaps in your continuous residence; they cannot be used as evidence that you meet the entire five year continuous residence requirement.
Q4. If I provide my employee with information regarding his or her employment to support a request for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me and/or my company?
A4. You may, as you determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting deferred action for childhood arrivals with documentation which verifies their employment.  This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes pursuant to INA section 274A unless there is evidence of egregious violations of criminal statutes or widespread abuses.
Cases in Other Immigration Processes
Q1: Will I be considered to be in unlawful status if I had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal pending before either USCIS or the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) on June 15, 2012?
A1: Yes.  If you had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal, or similar relief, pending before either USCIS or EOIR as of June 15, 2012, but had no lawful status, you may request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals.
Q2: Can I request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals from USCIS if I am in immigration detention under the custody of ICE?
A2: No.  If you are currently in immigration detention, you may not request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals from USCIS. If you think you may meet the guidelines of this process, you should identify yourself to your detention officer or contact the ICE Office of the Public Advocate so that ICE may review your case.  The ICE Office of the Public Advocate can be reached through the Office’s hotline at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., Monday – Friday) or by email at EROPublicAdvocate@ice.dhs.gov(link sends email)
Q3: If I am about to be removed by ICE and believe that I meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, what steps should I take to seek review of your case before removal?
A3: If you believe you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines and are about to be removed, you should immediately contact either the Law Enforcement Support Center’s hotline at 1-855-448-6903 (staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or the ICE Office of the Public Advocate through the Office’s hotline at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., Monday – Friday) or by email at EROPublicAdvocate@ice.dhs.gov(link sends email).
Q4: If individuals meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals and are encountered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or ICE, will they be placed into removal proceedings?
A4: This policy is intended to allow CBP and ICE to focus on priority cases. Pursuant to the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security, if an individual meets the guidelines of this process, CBP or ICE should exercise their discretion on a case-by-case basis to prevent qualifying individuals from being apprehended, placed into removal proceedings, or removed. If individuals believe that, in light of this policy, they should not have been placed into removal proceedings, contact either the Law Enforcement Support Center’s hotline at 1-855-448-6903 (staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or the ICE Office of the Public Advocate through the Office’s hotline at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., Monday – Friday) or by email at EROPublicAdvocate@ice.dhs.gov(link sends email).
Q5: If I accepted an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process or my case was terminated as part of the case-by-case review process, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?
A5: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals even if you have accepted an offer of administrative closure or termination under the case-by-case review process. If you are in removal proceedings and have already been identified as meeting the guidelines and warranting discretion as part of ICE’s case-by-case review, ICE already has offered you deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal.
Q6: If I declined an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?
A6: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals from USCIS even if you declined an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process.
Q7: If my case was reviewed as part of the case-by-case review process but I was not offered administrative closure, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?
A7: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals from USCIS even if you were not offered administrative closure following review of you case as part of the case-by-case review process.
Q8: How will ICE and USCIS handle cases involving individuals who do not satisfy the guidelines of this process but believe they may warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under the June 2011 Prosecutorial Discretion Memoranda?
A8: If USCIS determines that you do not satisfy the guidelines or otherwise determines you do not warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, then it will decline to defer action in your case. If you are currently in removal proceedings, have a final order, or have a voluntary departure order, you may then request ICE consider whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion under the ICE June 2011 Prosecutorial Discretion Memoranda through any of the established channels at ICE, including through a request to the ICE Office of the Public Advocate or to the local Field Office Director. USCIS will not consider requests for review under the ICE June 2011 Prosecutorial Discretion Memoranda.
Q9: What should I do if I meet the guidelines of this process and have been issued an ICE detainer following an arrest by a state or local law enforcement officer?
A9: If you meet the guidelines and have been served a detainer, you should immediately contact either the Law Enforcement Support Center’s hotline at 1-855-448-6903 (staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or the ICE Office of the Public Advocate either through the Office’s hotline at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., Monday – Friday) or by email at EROPublicAdvocate@ice.dhs.gov(link sends email).
Avoiding Scams and Preventing Fraud
Q1: Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my deferred action for childhood arrivals request, is this true?
A1: No. There is no expedited processing for deferred action. Dishonest practitioners may promise to provide you with faster services if you pay them a fee. These people are trying to scam you and take your money. Visit our Avoid Scams page to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams.
Make sure you seek information about requests for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals from official government sources such as USCIS or the Department of Homeland Security. If you are seeking legal advice, visit our Find Legal Services page to learn how to choose a licensed attorney or accredited representative.
Q2: What steps will USCIS and ICE take if I engage in fraud through the new process?
A2: If you knowingly make a misrepresentation, or knowingly fail to disclose facts, in an effort to have your case deferred or obtain work authorization through this new process, you will be treated as an immigration enforcement priority to the fullest extent permitted by law, and be subject to criminal prosecution and/or removal from the United States.

Transporting Firearms and Ammunition
You may transport unloaded firearms in a locked hard-sided container as checked baggage only. Declare the firearm and/or ammunition to the airline when checking your bag at the ticket counter. The container must completely secure the firearm from being accessed. Locked cases that can be easily opened are not permitted. Be aware that the container the firearm was in when purchased may not adequately secure the firearm when it is transported in checked baggage.
Contact AskTSA or TSA Contact Center with questions you have regarding TSA firearm regulations and for clarification on what you may or may not transport in your carry-on or checked baggage.
Firearms
When traveling, comply with the laws concerning possession of firearms as they vary by local, state and international governments.
If you are traveling internationally with a firearm in checked baggage, please check the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website for information and requirements prior to travel.
Declare each firearm each time you present it for transport as checked baggage. Ask your airline about limitations or fees that may apply.
Firearms must be unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container and transported as checked baggage only. As defined by 49 CFR 1540.5 a loaded firearm has a live round of ammunition, or any component thereof, in the chamber or cylinder or in a magazine inserted in the firearm. For civil enforcement purposes, TSA also considers a firearm to be loaded when both the firearm and ammunition are accessible to the passenger. For example, if an individual has a firearm in accessible baggage and ammunition in his/her pocket, or any combination where the individual has access to both, the firearm is considered ""loaded"" for purposes of assessing a civil penalty. Only the passenger should retain the key or combination to the lock unless TSA personnel request the key to open the firearm container to ensure compliance with TSA regulations. You may use any brand or type of lock to secure your firearm case, including TSA-recognized locks.
Bringing  an unloaded firearm with accessible ammunition to the security checkpoint carries the same civil penalty/fine as bringing a loaded firearm to the checkpoint. You may find information on civil penalties at the Civil Enforcement page.
Firearm parts, including magazines, clips, bolts and firing pins, are prohibited in carry-on baggage, but may be transported in checked baggage.
Replica firearms, including firearm replicas that are toys, may be transported in checked baggage only.
Rifle scopes are permitted in carry-on and checked baggage.
  United States Code, Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 44, firearm definitions includes: any weapon (including a starter gun) which will, or is designed to, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; the frame or receiver of any such weapon; any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; and any destructive device. As defined by 49 CFR 1540.5 a loaded firearm has a live round of ammunition, or any component thereof, in the chamber or cylinder or in a magazine inserted in the firearm.
Ammunition
Ammunition is prohibited in carry-on baggage, but may be transported in checked baggage.
Firearm magazines and ammunition clips, whether loaded or empty, must be securely boxed or included within a hard-sided case containing an unloaded firearm. Read the requirements governing the transport of ammunition in checked baggage as defined by 49 CFR 175.10 (a)(8).
Small arms ammunition (up to .75 caliber and shotgun shells of any gauge) must be packaged in a fiber (such as cardboard), wood, plastic, or metal box specifically designed to carry ammunition and declared to your airline.
Ammunition may be transported in the same hard-sided, locked case as a firearm if it has been packed as described above. You cannot use firearm magazines or clips for packing ammunition unless they completely enclose the ammunition. Firearm magazines and ammunition clips, whether loaded or empty, must be boxed or included within a hard-sided, locked case. 
Please check with your airline for quantity limits for ammunition.

Firearms must be unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container and transported as checked baggage only. As defined by 49 CFR 1540.5 a loaded firearm has a live round of ammunition, or any component thereof, in the chamber or cylinder or in a magazine inserted in the firearm. For civil enforcement purposes, TSA also considers a firearm to be loaded when both the firearm and ammunition are accessible to the passenger. For example, if an individual has a firearm in accessible baggage and ammunition in his/her pocket, or any combination where the individual has access to both, the firearm is considered ""loaded"" for purposes of assessing a civil penalty. Only the passenger should retain the key or combination to the lock unless TSA personnel request the key to open the firearm container to ensure compliance with TSA regulations. You may use any brand or type of lock to secure your firearm case, including TSA-recognized locks.
Bringing  an unloaded firearm with accessible ammunition to the security checkpoint carries the same civil penalty/fine as bringing a loaded firearm to the checkpoint. You may find information on civil penalties at the Civil Enforcement page.
Firearm parts, including magazines, clips, bolts and firing pins, are prohibited in carry-on baggage, but may be transported in checked baggage.
Replica firearms, including firearm replicas that are toys, may be transported in checked baggage only.
Rifle scopes are permitted in carry-on and checked baggage.
  United States Code, Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 44, firearm definitions includes: any weapon (including a starter gun) which will, or is designed to, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; the frame or receiver of any such weapon; any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; and any destructive device. As defined by 49 CFR 1540.5 a loaded firearm has a live round of ammunition, or any component thereof, in the chamber or cylinder or in a magazine inserted in the firearm.
Ammunition
Ammunition is prohibited in carry-on baggage, but may be transported in checked baggage.
Firearm magazines and ammunition clips, whether loaded or empty, must be securely boxed or included within a hard-sided case containing an unloaded firearm. Read the requirements governing the transport of ammunition in checked baggage as defined by 49 CFR 175.10 (a)(8).
Small arms ammunition (up to .75 caliber and shotgun shells of any gauge) must be packaged in a fiber (such as cardboard), wood, plastic, or metal box specifically designed to carry ammunition and declared to your airline.
Ammunition may be transported in the same hard-sided, locked case as a firearm if it has been packed as described above. You cannot use firearm magazines or clips for packing ammunition unless they completely enclose the ammunition. Firearm magazines and ammunition clips, whether loaded or empty, must be boxed or included within a hard-sided, locked case.

Summary
CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 915 would cost about $1 million annually, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.
H.R. 915 would authorize a program known as the Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Under the BEST program (which is currently administered by DHS), personnel from federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law-enforcement agencies share information and carry out law-enforcement operations to combat criminal activity near the United States borders. DHS expects to spend about $1 million in fiscal year 2012 from appropriated funds to oversee the program, and CBO estimates that DHS’s continued oversight of the program would require appropriations of about that much each year.
H.R. 915 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.
On September 29, 2011, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 915 as ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on September 21, 2011. The act would authorize the appropriation of $10 million annually over the 2012-2016 period for the BEST program, and CBO estimated that implementing H.R. 915 would cost $48 million over the 2012-2016 period, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts. The Senate committee version of the legislation contains no specified authorization level.

Criminal intelligence and information sharing I Countering kidnapping I Border management I Container Control
In every country in the world, law enforcement officials are at the frontline of efforts to combat organized crime.  The building of criminal investigative and other law enforcement capacity is a core component of UNODC's work. Technical assistance includes institutional and operational capacity building of law enforcement and judicial bodies to strengthen investigation and prosecution of organized crimes. Training is offered to police investigators, prosecutors and judges, criminal intelligence analysts, specialized drug and organized crime investigators and customs officials.
UNODC delivers a range of trainings to law enforcement officers on topics of relevance to fighting organized crime in their local contexts. It also employs modern technical training such as computer-based training as well as assistance in improving information exchange between law enforcement agencies, custom and border control authorities in different countries.
UNODC also supports evidence-based law enforcement responses by analyzing report questionnaires submitted by States parties to the Organized Crime Convention. On this basis, research conducted by UNODC is vital in identifying regional and global organized crime trends, forecasting future trends and strengthening the capacity of States to respond reactively and proactively.
Read UNODC analysis of crime typologies.
Criminal intelligence and information sharing
Criminal intelligence has been described as the lifeblood of the fight against transnational organized crime. It is the foundation for all proactive investigations and a cross-cutting issue since the same expertise and methodology is used for all serious crimes, including, corruption, drug trafficking,  and terrorism. A fundamental component of building law enforcement capacity involves enhancing understanding of how criminal intelligence works and how practically to develop, share and use it.
In order to operate internationally, individual Member States must have the capacity within their own law enforcement structures to collect, collate, analyze and disseminate information on criminals and the organizations within which they operate. UNODC is supporting criminal intelligence capabilities of law enforcement agencies through the provision of policy advice, assessment and gap analysis, and training of criminal analysts (including in using specialist analytical software), front-line law enforcement and policy makers, including through the use of a set of recently published criminal intelligence training manuals.
In this context, UNODC has published a series of criminal intelligence guides for managers, analysts and frontline law enforcement respectively, to serve as reference tools for law enforcement officials performing their respective roles, or to accompany and reinforce training courses in the discipline. Capacity building initiatives are supported by training that emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in the investigation of transnational organized crime.
Before a State can begin to respond to criminal threats, it must first understand them. Effective responses must be based on evidence as to the nature of organized crime and the extent to which organized crime groups affect States. The SOCTA Handbook (not link to get the guide) (Guidance on the use and preparation of serious organized crime threat assessments)  is a guide to preparing a national serious organized crime threat assessment.  Produced by UNODC in conjunction with Interpol, the SOCTA handbook represents the result of collaboration with dedicated law enforcement professionals, representatives of international and non-governmental organizations as well as academic institutions. The SOCTA handbook assists policy makers and managers to make better decisions about their responses to serious crime and provides practitioners with guidance on carrying out their own national threat assessments in line with international best practice.
In addition, UNODC supports the criminal intelligence capabilities for a growing number of regional coordination centers such as the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Centre for combating illicit  drug trafficking (CARICC) based in Tajikistan; the Joint Planning Cell (JPC) which is part of the Triangular Initiative; the Transnational Crime Units under the West African Coast Initiative (WACI) and the and the Gulf Council Intelligence Centre (GCIC), based in Doha.
For more information, see the Global Programme .
Countering kidnapping
The international community is increasingly concerned about the use of kidnapping by organized criminal groups. In the most severely affected countries, several hundred kidnappings occur annually.
Criminal groups are involved in kidnapping for the purpose of extortion, as a method of accumulating capital for other criminal activities, such as trafficking in firearms, money laundering, drug trafficking, trafficking in people and crimes related to terrorism. In its resolution 2002/16 of 24 July 2002, the Economic and Social Council vigorously condemned and rejected kidnapping in any circumstance for any purpose, and resolved to treat it as a serious crime, particularly when it was connected with actions of organized criminal or terrorist groups.
While definitional and recording problems make the crime difficult to assess the incidence of kidnapping at the international level, it is clear that States generally consider this crime to be a serious one. When committed by an organized crime group, the crime can be addressed in the framework of the provisions on mutual legal assistance and extradition of the  Organized Crime Convention.
Three interconnected recommendations that appeared appropriate in response to information-gathering efforts by UNODC, concern increased efforts to: (i) harmonize definitions and constituent elements of the crime; (ii) monitor the crime according to this common definition, and (iii) cooperate to exchange best practices to strengthen responses.
UNODC released a Counter-kidnapping Manual in 2006 aimed at providing authorities with guidance on preventing and investigating kidnapping cases. The manual is available upon request.
For more information, see the reports of the Secretary-General on 'International cooperation in the prevention, combating and elimination of kidnapping and in providing assistance to victims': E/CN.15/2003/7 and E/CN.15/2004/7.
Border management
Border control officials are often at the frontline of defense against organized crime and may be called upon to identify and apprehend criminals and protect and assist victims. It is therefore essential that border control officers be supported in their role as first responders.
UNODC's Border Liaison Officer (BLO) programme supports countries to better manage their borders and to better communicate with their counterparts on the other side of the same border. Specific activities and interventions within the BLO programme differ depending on the particular context and the funding available.  Often border officials are sparsely equipped, with limited resources with which to patrol borders and react when borders are breached. The BLO programme provides beneficiaries with technical resources (such as computers) and transport resources (such as motorbikes) with which to strengthen their responsive capacity. Additionally, the programme acts to build trust and dialogue between border staff on both sides of the border and strengthen communication between them so as to empower both sides to act and respond quickly to border threats.
The results of UNODC's BLO programme have included demonstrated improvement of border management through strengthened communication and collaboration between border agencies. Increased confidence and trust between personnel has lead to regular meetings between actors on both sides of the border, efficient information exchange and the development of joint operations, patrols and surveillance. This increased communication and collaboration in turn means that effective border management becomes self-sustaining.
Container Control
International trade is one of the significant contributing factors as well as by-products of globalization. Trade can significantly contribute to sustainable development though increased economic opportunities in movement of goods around the world.  However, many developing countries do not have the capacity to effectively harness the goods of international trade, while also ensuring trade security and standards at their ports, handling terminals and borders.
Although freight containers are an important part of the trade supply chain, they are used by organized criminals to traffic illicit drugs, precursor chemicals, weapons, explosives and other contraband. Where the trafficking of illicit goods through containers is not intercepted by law enforcement authorities, it fuels the commission of other serious crimes. For instance, trafficking of weapons and explosives raises concern about trafficking in containers being used directly or indirectly for terrorist attacks.
The UNODC Container Control Programme, in partnership with the World Customs Organization, aims to assist governments to establish effective container controls that serve to prevent illegal activity while also facilitating legal trade.
Through this programme, Joint Port Control Units, comprised of customs and police officers, are established at selected ports. Border guards, sea port authorities and other relevant agencies can also be beneficiaries of the programme. Staff are trained and equipped to identify and inspect high-risk freight containers with minimum disruption to legitimate trade and business. The Control Units have regular access to experts and specialist mentor services and are encouraged to forge partnerships and links with the trade and business community. A comprehensive basis for Joint Port Control Units is established for the exchange of information and intelligence and use of risk assessment and targeting techniques to identify high-risk consignments for law enforcement scrutiny, without hindering free flow of legitimate trade.
The programme further aims to promote the formation of alliances between customs, trade and enforcement communities as a means of collectively preventing the abuse of legitimate commercial trade for the purposes of organized crime.

Fact Sheet: Beyond the Border United States – Canada Law Enforcement Cooperation
Release Date: December 6, 2011
The United States and Canada have long enjoyed a collaborative law enforcement relationship. Through joint threat assessment, investigations, operations, and support for prosecutions, consistent with our respective domestic laws, we have made both countries more secure while facilitating lawful travel and trade. Three ongoing partnerships are key to facilitating cross-border law enforcement collaboration:
ShipRider pilot program – Under the ShipRider pilot, officially known as Integrated Cross-border Maritime Law Enforcement Operations (ICMLEO), cross-designated officers perform joint patrols in the maritime areas between our countries, removing the maritime border as an impediment to law enforcement operations. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are the primary ShipRider participants.
 Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBETs) – IBETs enhance border integrity and security between designated ports of entry along the U.S.-Canada border by identifying, investigating, and interdicting persons, organizations, and goods that threaten the national security of one or both countries or that are involved in organized criminal activity. The five core IBET agencies are: RCMP; the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA); U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and the USCG.
 Border Enforcement Security Taskforces (BESTs) – BESTs are multi-agency teams that identify, investigate, disrupt, and dismantle criminal organizations posing significant threats to border security. BESTs, which are ICE-led, utilize co-located and cross-designated investigative assets of federal, state/provincial, local, and tribal law enforcement partners on both sides of the border to investigate transnational crime.
Additionally, through the U.S.-Canada Cross Border Crime Forum (CBCF), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Attorney General meet with the Ministers of Public Safety Canada and Justice Canada to discuss and advance initiatives that address cross-border criminal activity.
Through the Beyond the Border Action Plan, the United States and Canada commit to further enhance cross-border law enforcement collaboration. Among other initiatives, our countries intend expand ICMLEO ShipRider, enhance cross-border radio interoperability, and build on the success of ShipRider, IBET, and BEST to pilot the next generation of integrated cross-border law enforcement. These efforts will be coordinated by the CBCF.

GROEN was convicted April 28, 2011, following a two day jury trial in U.S. District Court in Seattle.  GROEN was indicted in January 2011, for the events of September 22, 2010, when GROEN shined a high powered spotlight on a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter that was being flown by a pilot wearing night vision goggles.  The spotlight blinded the pilot making it impossible for him to see the airspace around him, and the dials necessary for flying the aircraft.  The co-pilot had to direct the pilot to fly out of the area.  At sentencing U.S. District Judge Thomas S. Zilly noted that CBP and Border Patrol personnel put their lives at risk every time they report for duty.  The judge told GROEN, “What you did was stupid.  We’re all lucky that you are standing here convicted of a charge, and that the helicopter did not crash.”
            “There is no question that federal law enforcement needs to keep working to address community concerns at the border.  But endangering lives, as Mr. Groen did, is not the answer and cannot be tolerated,” said U.S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan.  “These pilots not only keep our borders secure, they serve the community in many ways.  Less than 24 hours before this incident, this Customs and Border Protection helicopter was assisting at the scene of a fatal car crash, and helping search for a missing 62-year-old woman.  Wayne Groen had no idea what work he was disrupting, and he had no right to interfere with CBP’s important public service mission.”
            According to records filed in the case and testimony at trial, at about 9:35 in the evening on September 22, 2010, the helicopter was supporting law enforcement on the ground working to intercept those illegally crossing into the U.S. from Canada.  The helicopter was about 600 feet off the ground, near the Abbotsford B.C. airport, when the defendant targeted a high powered spotlight directly into the cockpit of the aircraft, endangering the aircraft, pilots and people on the ground.  The beam was trained on the helicopter for three to five minutes.  The helicopter returned shortly thereafter to assist in discovering the source of the spotlight.  The pilots and investigators on the ground observed that the spotlight was coming from the vicinity of GROEN’s home.  When an agent on the ground drove up GROEN’s street, GROEN shined a high powered spotlight at him.  GROEN got out of the car with the high powered spotlight in his hand.  GROEN was arrested December 17, 2010, on a criminal complaint.
            In requesting a ten month prison sentence, prosecutors noted that GROEN’s actions endangered the pilots and people on the ground.  The conduct is also part of a pattern of harassment of law enforcement.  “First, the defendant’s own history with law enforcement shows that he is hostile, belligerent, and reckless with any law enforcement, not simply CBP.  He is not picky when he is looking to harass someone. Indeed, the most dangerous incident before the instant conduct was when he repeatedly yelled at, taunted, tailed, highbeamed, swore at, and ultimately threatened a sheriff deputy by yelling, “I have a shotgun!,” when the sheriff had the nerve to ticket his son for running a stop sign at 80 miles per hour,” prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo.

Judge Zilly noted that it was troubling to him that “we have a person who has demonstrated on several occasions disrespect for law enforcement…. Living near the border provides challenges for those who live near the border and those who are employed as law enforcement…. They do difficult work for all of us.”
            The case was investigated by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.  The case was being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Jerrod Patterson and Jill Otake.

BUREAU OF COUNTERTERRORISM
OUR WORK
Antiterrorism Assistance Program
Countering the Financing of Terrorism Finance
Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund
Global Counterterrorism Forum
Technical Support Working Group
Terrorist Screening and Interdiction Programs
Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership
Partnership for Regional East African Counterterrorism
The Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT) works to strengthen partnerships, civilian capacity, and information sharing around the world to counter evolving terrorist threats and prevent the spread of violent extremism. CT designs, manages, and oversees foreign assistance to build the civilian capabilities of foreign government partners to counter terrorism and violent extremism in an effective and sustainable fashion. CT seeks to build law enforcement and judicial capabilities to mitigate attacks, disrupt terrorist transit, and arrest, investigate, prosecute, and incarcerate terrorists in accordance with the rule of law. To bolster these efforts, CT seeks to promote the leadership of other countries to build capacity in third countries in their regions. CT also seeks to strengthen partnerships and initiatives involving government and non-governmental actors to counter sources of violent extremist messaging, narratives, and recruitment.
Antiterrorism Assistance Program (ATA)
Since its creation in 1983, the Antiterrorism Assistance (ATA) program has served as the primary provider of U.S. government antiterrorism training and equipment to law-enforcement agencies of partner nations throughout the world, and has delivered counterterrorism training to more than 90,000 law enforcement personnel from 154 countries.
From prevention of terrorist attacks to responding to and mitigating terrorist attacks, ATA helps partner nations build critical capabilities across a wide spectrum of counterterrorism skills. ATA will continue to provide training courses, consultations, mentorships, seminars, and equipment relevant to investigations, border security, protection of critical targets, leadership and management, regional coordination and cooperation, critical incident response and management, and cyber security. As terrorist networks continue to adjust their tactics and strategies, ATA will continue to adapt and refine its counterterrorism training initiatives to meet evolving threats.
All ATA courses emphasize the importance of the rule of law and respect for human rights.
The ATA program’s policy formulation, strategic guidance, and oversight are managed by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Counterterrorism, while implementation and program administration are the responsibility of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS).
Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)
The Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT) uses a range of tools and programs to isolate and weaken terrorist groups and their support networks. CT leads Department of State efforts to designate terrorist organizations and individuals, including freezing their financial assets, blocking their financial transactions, and preventing others from providing them with material or financial support. Terrorism designations expose and isolate organizations and individuals, impose serious sanctions on them, and enable coordinated action across the U.S. government and with our international partners to disrupt the activities of terrorists, including by denying them access to the U.S. financial system and enabling U.S. law enforcement actions.
CT also helps build the capacity of foreign partners to detect illicit funds – especially those from terrorist organizations emanating from, transiting through, or entering their countries – by helping them identify deficiencies in their national anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) regimes and building knowledge and skills to address those deficiencies. CT helps partner countries build their AML/CFT legal frameworks to meet the international standards established by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the UN, including establishing and implementing sound financial regulatory systems covering both the formal and informal sectors; developing effective financial intelligence units that can identify illicit financing, analyze suspicious transactions, and disseminate information; and equipping law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and judges to investigate and develop evidence to prosecute and adjudicate AML/CFT cases.
CT works with federal agencies such as the Department of Justice’s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training and Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network;, the Internal Revenue Service;, and the Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Investigations; to implement and achieve these objectives, along with non-governmental organizations and the private sector. We also address specific CFT challenges relating to foreign terrorist fighters and kidnapping for ransom.
Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF)
The Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT) is managing the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF), which is designed to build a network of partnerships from South Asia to the Sahel to develop more effective partnerships in countries and regions where terrorist networks seek to establish a foothold. CTPF funding seeks to strengthen civilian counterterrorism partnerships in key countries around the world. In coordination with the Department of Defense’s CTPF efforts, CT seeks to use State’s funding to build the capacity of criminal justice sector actors who can respond to, arrest, investigate, prosecute, and incarcerate terrorist suspects, recruiters, and financiers in accordance with due process and the rule of law. CT also seeks to use CTPF funding to expand partnerships with non-security and non-governmental actors to counter radicalization and recruitment to violent extremism, especially in regions threatened by ISIS.
Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF)
The Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) is a multilateral body that seeks to promote civilian cooperation and good practices to counter terrorism. The GCTF is composed of 30 countries and the EU. It consists of a strategic-level Coordinating Committee and five thematic and regional expert-driven working groups focusing on the criminal justice sector and rule of law; countering violent extremism; and capacity building in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and Southeast Asia. The GCTF aims to strengthen the international architecture for addressing 21st century terrorism and promotes a strategic, long-term approach to dealing with the threat.
Since its launch in September 2011, the GCTF has mobilized over US $200 million to strengthen counterterrorism-related rule of law institutions, in particular, for countries transitioning away from emergency law.
Other accomplishments since the launch include the adoption of various sets of good practices that are intended to both provide practical guidance for countries as they seek to enhance their counterterrorism capacity and bring greater strategic coherence to global counterterrorism capacity building efforts.
In addition, the GCTF served as impetus for the development of three “inspired” institutions in order to address the Forum’s areas of strategic priority: countering violent extremism (CVE) and strengthening the rule of law. These institutions provide a vehicle for the operationalization, promotion, and implementation of some of the GCTF good practices surrounding CVE and rule of law. These three institutions include:
The Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF), based of its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, GCERF is the first global effort to support local, community-level initiatives aimed at strengthening resilience against violent extremism.
Hedayah, based in Abu Dhabi, UAE, serves as a CVE center of excellence and a training hub.
The International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law (IIJ), based in Valletta, Malta, provides lawmakers, law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, correctional officials, and other justice sector stakeholders with the training and tools required to address terrorism and related transnational criminal activity.
The UN is a close partner of and participant in the GCTF and its activities. The GCTF serves as a mechanism for furthering the implementation of the universally-agreed UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and, more broadly, to complement and reinforce existing multilateral counterterrorism efforts, starting with those of the UN.
Technical Support Working Group (TSWG)
The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) is an interagency forum that coordinates U.S. government-wide technology prototyping under the National Combating Terrorism Research and Development (R&D) Program. The mission of the TSWG is to identify, prioritize, and coordinate interagency and international R&D requirements and to rapidly develop technologies and equipment to meet the high-priority needs of the combating terrorism community. The TSWG also addresses joint international operational requirements through cooperative R&D with select NATO members, major non-NATO allies, and other friendly foreign nations. The Bureau of Counterterrorism co-chairs the TSWG in partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (OASD SO/LIC). By leveraging common technical requirements and initiatives, the TSWG develops new products and capabilities for those on the front lines of the counterterrorism effort. The TSWG incorporates expertise from a variety of U.S. and international sources to deliver operational support to first responders, military forces, and to other federal, state, and local government security officials.
More information about the TSWG, participating departments and agencies, and the National Combating Terrorism Research and Development Program is available at the TSWG website .
Terrorist Screening and Interdiction Programs (TSI)
TSI programs disrupt terrorist networks through initiatives that enhance U.S. and our foreign partners’ ability to detect terrorists and secure borders. Bilateral terrorism screening information sharing agreements, negotiated pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6 (HSPD-6), strengthen our screening capabilities, while the Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP)/Personal Identification Secure Comparison and Evaluation System (PISCES) provides partner countries border security assistance to identify, disrupt, and deter terrorist travel.
Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP)
Established in 2005, the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) is a multifaceted, multi-year strategy implemented jointly by the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Department of Defense to assist partners in West and North Africa increase their immediate and long-term capabilities to address terrorist threats and prevent the spread of violent extremism.
Areas of support include:
Enabling and enhancing the capacity of North and West African militaries and law enforcement to conduct counterterrorism operations;
Integrating the ability of North and West African militaries and law enforcement, and other supporting partners, to operate regionally and collaboratively on counterterrorism efforts;
Enhancing border security capacity to monitor, restrain, and interdict terrorist movements;
Strengthening the rule of law, including access to justice, and law enforcement’s ability to detect, disrupt, respond to, investigate, and prosecute terrorist activity;
Monitoring and countering the financing of terrorism (such as that related to kidnapping for ransom); and
Reducing the limited sympathy and support among communities for violent extremism.
TSCTP partners include Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tunisia.
In addition to training and equipping security forces to more effectively combat terrorist threats, TSCTP targets groups in isolated or neglected regions who are most vulnerable to extremist ideologies by supporting youth employment, strengthening local governance capacity to provide development infrastructure, and improving health and educational services.
Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism (PREACT)
First established in 2009, the Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism (PREACT), is a U.S.-funded and implemented multi-year, multi-faceted program designed to build the capacity and cooperation of military, law enforcement, and civilian actors across East Africa to counter terrorism in a comprehensive fashion. It uses law enforcement, military, and development resources to achieve its strategic objectives, including:
Reducing the operational capacity of terrorist networks;
Developing a rule of law framework for countering terrorism in partner nations;
Enhancing border security;
Countering the financing of terrorism; and
Reducing the appeal of radicalization and recruitment to violent extremism.
Active PREACT partners include Djibouti, Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda. Burundi, Comoros, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Seychelles, South Sudan, and Sudan are also members of PREACT.

Intellectual Property Rights
Trade in counterfeit and pirated goods threatens America’s innovation economy, the competitiveness of our businesses, the livelihoods of U.S. workers, and, in some cases, national security and the health and safety of consumers.
Trade in these illegitimate goods is associated with smuggling and other criminal activities, and often funds criminal enterprises. CBP Trade protects the intellectual property rights of American businesses, safeguarding them from unfair competition, and use for malicious intent while upholding American innovation and ingenuity.
CBP targets and seizes imports of counterfeit and pirated goods, and enforces exclusion orders on patent-infringing and other IPR violative goods.
Intellectual Property Rights Fiscal Year 2023  Seizure Statistics
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)-Homeland Security Investigation (HSI) seized 19,522 shipments containing goods that violated Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, which equates to nearly 23 million counterfeit goods. The total estimated manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of the seized goods, had they been genuine, was over $2.41 billion (USD). In FY 2023, ICE-HSI arrested 434 individuals, obtained 327 indictments, and received 206 convictions related to intellectual property crimes. 
Wearing Apparel/Accessories topped the list for number of seizure lines with 26,400 representing 26.0% of all IPR seizures. However, Watches/Jewelry were the top products seized in terms of total MSRP value with seizures valued at over $1 billion (USD), representing 43.4% of the total. Handbags/Wallets came in second with an estimated value of over $653 million (USD), corresponding to approximately 27.1 % of the total value of goods seized due to intellectual property rights violations.
E-commerce is a growing segment of the economy in the United States. In FY 2023, CBP processed over 1 billion de minimis shipments (shipments valued at under $800). CBP has been working to improve trade risk management in the e-commerce environment by working closely with the trade community and operating two test pilot programs, the Section 321 Data Pilot and the Entry Type 86 Test. In FY 2023, CBP received 785.7 million filings on de minimis shipments (162.5 million Section 321 Data Pilot; 623.1 million Entry Type 86). The Entry Type 86 filings accounted for over 60% of all de minimis shipments. For more information about e-commerce and the related pilot programs, please visit the E-Commerce webpage.
The People’s Republic of China remained the primary source economy for counterfeit and pirated goods seized, accounting for a total estimated MSRP value of over $1.48 billion (USD) or approximately 61% of the total MSRP value of all IPR seizures.

IMMIGRATION REFORM & BORDER SECURITY
Immigration Reform & Border Security
Why it matters: A humanitarian and security crisis exists along our southern border that requires immediate action. The fact that our border can be penetrated so easily leaves us vulnerable to national security threats and has resulted in an influx of criminal activity, especially as it relates to narcotics and human trafficking. It is a serious crisis in need of a serious legislative solution. 
Where I stand: It is in our national interest to secure the border. Congress has an obligation to ensure our homeland is secure. That means we must allocate the resources to ensure that our borders are properly secured. 
We also have a responsibility to ensure that our immigration laws are being enforced. The death of Kathryn (Kate) Steinle—who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had previously been convicted for seven felonies and had been previously deported five times—shows when local officials ignore federal immigration law and shield illegal immigrants from deportation, Americans are put at risk. I have met with numerous Arkansas families who have personally been impacted by criminal activity of illegal immigrants. We simply must act.
While national security must be the top priority when reforming our immigration system, the economic security of American citizens must also be protected. That is why I support efforts to hold employers accountable to ensure they are hiring legal workers and oppose efforts to provide amnesty to illegal immigrants. 
We are a nation of immigrants and must remain welcoming to those who want to achieve the American Dream. We should be proud of our record to naturalize those who immigrate here legally. We naturalize more new citizens per year than the rest of the world combined. However, it is vital that we enforce the law and ensure the safety and security of our nation. That must remain the top priority for lawmakers in Washington.
What I’ve done: I have consistently supported policies that provide additional resources to enforce our immigration laws, secure our border and ensure employers are hiring legal workers. I have, and will continue, to strongly oppose efforts to grant amnesty to those who break our immigration laws. 
Senator Boozman Fights for Immigration Enforcement and Secure Borders 
As a member of the Border Security and Enforcement First Caucus, Senator Boozman has traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border to examine existing challenges in controlling illegal immigration.
He supported the Trump administration’s efforts to secure our southern border through a strong border system that includes a physical wall as well as other useful tools and strategies that our Customs and Border Patrol agents indicate are helpful in deterring or apprehending those who seek to illegally enter our country. He has also met with numerous Arkansas families who have personally been impacted by criminal activity committed by illegal immigrants and agree with them that their experiences were avoidable and further proof that it is past time to act on this issue.  
In addition to securing the border, Arkansans believe that our immigration system must be repaired, reformed and strengthened in order to provide the benefits and protection our country deserves. Boozman has supported efforts to hold employers accountable to ensure they are hiring legal workers through a mandatory E-Verify system and will always oppose efforts to provide amnesty to illegal immigrants. It’s important to realize that any proposed reforms to our immigration system – through which we naturalize more new citizens per year than the rest of the world combined – must primarily benefit our nation and its citizens in order to achieve legitimacy in the eyes of Americans.

Mitchellville Arms Dealer Sentenced For Unlicensed Export Of Firearms And Ammunition To Nigeria
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 11, 2011
Greenbelt, Maryland - Chief U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow sentenced Boniface Ibe, age 50, of Mitchellville, Maryland, today to five months in prison followed by 10 months of supervised release for exporting arms and controlled goods to Nigeria without a license, and for delivering a firearm to a common carrier without written notice.
The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge William Winter of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations; U.S. Customs and Border Protection Baltimore Port Director Ricardo Scheller; Special Agent in Charge Theresa R. Stoop of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - Baltimore Field Division; and Rick Shimon of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Export Enforcement's Washington Field Office.
“The sentencing today reflects the commitment and success of law enforcement working collaboratively to protect our U.S. weapons and ammunition from falling in the hands of evil doers,” said William Winter, Special Agent in Charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Baltimore. “ICE HSI will continue to work with our partners in law enforcement to bring those to justice who continue to break our export and licensing laws.”
“Illegal weapons trafficking is a very serious violation of U.S. law,” said Customs and Border Protection Baltimore Port Director Ricardo Scheller. “This conviction and sentencing should be a warning to all illegal arms dealers that Customs and Border Protection officers remain committed to working with our law enforcement partners to combat the illegal exportation of weapons at our nation’s ports of entry.”
“We are proud to have worked in cooperation with our Federal partners to send the individual to jail who is responsible for trafficking hundreds of weapons to another country,” says ATF Special Agent in Charge Theresa R. Stoop. “We will continue these efforts to stem the illegal flow of weapons so that we ensure the safety of law abiding citizens both inside and outside our country.”
“This case reflects the outstanding collaborative work of multiple agencies to demonstrate the government’s resolve to vigorously enforce U.S. export laws,” said Rick Shimon, Special Agent in Charge of U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Export Enforcement’s Washington Field Office. “This sentence should also serve as a serious warning to those who would defy U.S. law for monetary gain.”
According to Ibe’s guilty plea, from November 2003 to August 2010, Ibe bought 194 shotguns and a .22 caliber handgun from gun shops in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas. On September 11, 2010 law enforcement learned that Ibe ordered a shipping container to be dropped and loaded with boxes at F&G Auto in Capitol Heights, Maryland. After the container was picked up and on September 22, 2010, law enforcement examined the shipping container at the Port of Baltimore and found eight shotguns, a .22 caliber handgun and .22 caliber ammunition concealed in a car inside the container. Shotgun ammunition was found in another vehicle in the container.
Dock receipts indicated that an individual in Nigeria was to receive the container, as well as at least four other containers shipped to Nigeria in 2008 and 2009. The .22 caliber handgun and ammunition are designated as significant military equipment controlled under the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations, and the shotguns are controlled for export under the Commerce Control List, all of which require a license for export. Ibe never possessed the necessary licenses or authorizations to export the firearms and ammunition.
United States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein commended ICE - Homeland Security Investigations; the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; ATF; and the Department of Commerce for their work in the investigation. Mr. Rosenstein thanked Assistant United States Attorney Christen A. Sproule, who prosecuted the case.

Testimony of Office of International Trade Assistant Commissioner Allen Gina, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, ""Oversight of Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Efforts""
Release Date: June 22, 2011
Dirksen Senate Office Building
Introduction
Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, and distinguished Members of the Judiciary Committee, I am pleased to appear before you today alongside witnesses from several government agencies, including Assistant Deputy Director Erik Barnett from our Department of Homeland Security sister agency U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to discuss the actions we are taking at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to ensure that the laws governing intellectual property rights (IPR) are properly enforced for goods imported to and exported from the United States.
My name is Allen Gina and I am the Assistant Commissioner for the Office of International Trade at CBP. My office is responsible for formulating CBP's policies on commercial trade, developing trade programs, and enforcing U.S. import laws.
CBP has the dual mission of securing our nation's borders, while at the same time facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel that is so important to our nation's economy. As an agency, we protect and process almost 106 million cars, buses, trucks, trains, vessels, and aircraft arriving at our borders each year. We screen more than 28 million commercial shipments arriving in air and maritime cargo, and 250 million more arriving in small parcels via express carriers and mail.
As America's frontline border agency, CBP plays a key role in safeguarding one of America's most valuable assets, its intellectual property (IP). According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ""IP-intensive industries employ nearly 18 million workers, account for more than 50% of all U.S. exports, and represent 40% of the country's growth."" Thus, the theft of intellectual property poses a serious threat to America's economic vitality. But counterfeit and pirated products do more than harm the competitiveness of our industries and the employment of U.S. workers. Fake goods are capable of injuring and killing consumers and can jeopardize public safety.
In protecting America from these threats, CBP recently announced its Five-Year IPR Strategy, which was delivered to Congress in July 2010 and provides a comprehensive enforcement strategy to reduce IPR violations, including recommendations for strengthening penalties, as well as timelines for developing improved targeting models, expanding training for all enforcement personnel and expanding post-audit reviews for IPR. In addition, CBP works closely with Victoria Espinel, the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) at the Office of Management and Budget to coordinate the U.S. government response to IPR theft, as outlined in the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-403). For example, CBP collaborated with the IPEC in drafting the Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement. Moreover, CBP led an interagency working group on combating counterfeit pharmaceuticals that developed actions for the Counterfeit Pharmaceutical Interagency Working Group Report to the Vice President and Congress issued by the IPEC in March 2011. We also conducted a comprehensive review of our legal authorities for the IPEC’s White Paper on Intellectual Property Enforcement Legislative Recommendations issued in March of this year.
Five-Year IPR Enforcement Strategy
CBP envisions an effective IPR enforcement process in which legitimate cargo is released without delay, infringing goods are intercepted, and future violators are deterred. To achieve this vision, CBP developed the comprehensive Five-Year IPR Strategy that is underpinned by partnerships with the private sector, other agencies and foreign governments; modernized laws, technologies and processes; and a budget initiative to support investments in human capital, outreach, and technology.
CBP's IPR Strategy furthers the competitiveness of U.S. industry; supports investment in IP research and development of U.S. workers; and protects American consumers, companies and national security from harm by counterfeiting and piracy. Our four part strategy breaks down the international trade process into four main areas: 1) facilitation of the release of legitimate cargo into commerce prior to its arrival at our borders; 2) enforcement against suspect shipments when they arrive at our borders; 3) deterrence of future IP theft by counterfeiters and pirates; and 4) modernization of trade practices.
To facilitate trade and ensure compliance with IPR laws, CBP will develop partnership programs with the trade community to manage supply and distribution chains, thus enhancing IPR targeting and facilitating the clearance of compliant cargo. To strengthen enforcement of IPR laws, CBP is developing better targeting models, expanding training for personnel involved in IPR enforcement and strengthening penalties. To advance national and economic security, CBP is engaging in cooperative efforts with other federal agencies and foreign governments to reduce international trade in counterfeit and pirated goods and to prioritize enforcement against IPR infringements with health and safety concerns, also modernizing IPR trade processes by streamlining processes and leveraging technology to more effectively enforce IPR.
Facilitation
Prior to the arrival of goods at our borders, CBP’s objective is to identify trusted importers and legitimate shipments, allowing CBP to focus its enforcement efforts on known IPR violators and on imports for which we have less information. To accomplish this, CBP is partnering with the private sector on supply and distribution chain management programs. These programs will provide information to help us be more effective in deciding which shipments to inspect, and which to release without delay.
CBP is using risk modeling to enhance IPR targeting systems to improve the selection of shipments with a high risk of containing IPR-infringing goods for examination. Ultimately, CBP’s goal is to more effectively focus our IPR enforcement resources on those imports with a higher risk for IPR infringement, thereby increasing interdictions of IPR infringing imports and facilitating the release of low risk imports.
To do this, CBP has implemented the Center for Excellence and Expertise (CEE), a pilot program within the pharmaceutical industry that is focused on ensuring a greater degree of uniformity across ports of entry so as to remove unnecessary transactional hurdles. Through the CEE, we are collaborating with the pharmaceutical industry and gaining intelligence to segment low-risk, trusted importers from those that present higher risk for IPR violations. This allows us to facilitate entry of low-risk shipments and focus IPR enforcement resources on inspecting higher-risk shipments. CBP is also working with the pharmaceutical industry on a public awareness campaign to educate the public on the dangers posed by counterfeit drugs, including those purchased overseas and online.
Expanding trust between the private sector and CBP through trusted partner programs – supply and distribution chain management – will prove advantageous to right holders, importers and CBP. Right holders will benefit from increased protection resulting from CBP’s increased targeting efficacy, and importers will experience a reduction in costs associated with unnecessary inspections and greater predictability in the processing of their shipments at the border. The additional information that will become available to CBP will improve IPR enforcement by enabling greater targeting efficacy and a corresponding increase in seizures. Lastly, improved infringement determination tools and processes will expedite the release of legitimate goods into the commerce and avoid the release of infringing goods.
Enforcement
When suspect goods arrive at our borders, CBP targets and inspects the goods, and seizes, forfeits and destroys counterfeit and pirated goods. CBP also enforces International Trade Commission exclusion orders, which are usually sought by patent owners. Exclusion orders enable CBP to provide protection for patented products. CBP is taking a number of steps to improve its efforts in these areas. This includes expanding IPR training for enforcement personnel and cooperating with other federal agencies and foreign governments to improve targeting and enforcement efforts.
To better equip officers in our ports of entry to enforce IPR, CBP is implementing Integrated IPR Field Training. This full-day, live, instructor-led course covers IPR policies, laws and operations. Furthermore, CBP launched a new program last year that encourages right holders to provide their product identification guides electronically to CBP. CBP makes the guides, which help us identify counterfeit and pirated products, readily available to our frontline officers in ports throughout the country. To date, CBP has received nearly 100 guides, helping us to better safeguard 1,300 trademarks and copyrights from counterfeiting and piracy.
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2010, cooperative efforts by CBP and ICE, including joint operations such as Operation Safe Summer, resulted in 19,959 seizures, an all time high and a 34 percent increase (from 14,841) in FY 2009. Included in these totals are seizures of counterfeit goods that put consumer safety and critical technology at risk, which rose dramatically due to our increased emphasis on enforcement in this area. The total number of consumer safety and critical technology IPR seizures increased 97 percent. The estimated manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP), which represents the value the seized goods would have had if they were genuine, is $1.4 billion.
CBP is aggressively pursuing new, and strengthening existing, bilateral and multilateral engagements with foreign counterparts in order to conduct joint customs IPR enforcement operations; share effective enforcement practices; and exchange information on IPR violations to better target and interdict counterfeit and pirated goods. For example, as part of its ongoing partnership with the European Union (EU) to enforce IPR, CBP and EU customs authorities conducted the first joint customs IPR enforcement operation, Operation Infrastructure, in 2008 to target counterfeit semiconductors and computer network hardware, primarily from China. The three-week operation resulted in the seizure of more than 360,000 counterfeit components involving 40 different trademarks, most of them belonging to U.S. companies. CBP and the EU also published joint guidance for rights holders on how to work with customs authorities to protect their intellectual property.
In addition, CBP leadership currently chairs sub-committees in both the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the World Customs Organization (WCO) and actively participates in such forums such as the U.S.-China Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade IPR Working Group. As a result of this engagement, earlier this year CBP proposed the first ever joint IPR enforcement operation among APEC customs authorities, including China, to engage in a joint operation targeting IPR violations later this summer. Moreover, in conjunction with the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), CBP has increased collaboration with China Customs on IPR enforcement to combat the prolific trade in counterfeit goods coming from China. CBP also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with China’s Ministry of Public Security during the S&ED to expand intelligence and information-sharing and increase coordinated enforcement efforts with China’s enforcement agencies.
CBP also works with other federal agencies to build IPR enforcement capacity in countries around the world. We train foreign officials to increase their IPR enforcement skills and promote better IPR border enforcement to combat global trade in IPR-infringing goods.
Deterrence
In conjunction with our IPR enforcement efforts directed at goods entering and exiting the United States, CBP is working proactively to deter future violations. Such initiatives include strengthening the deterrent effect of fines and penalties by appropriately levying them and increasing collections; expanding and increasing the effectiveness of IPR audits to deprive counterfeiters and pirates of their illicit profits; and promoting criminal enforcement against counterfeiting and piracy by collaborating with ICE and supporting the IPR Center.
Between FY 2006 and FY 2010, CBP increased the number of IPR penalties it assessed by 8 percent and the amount it collected by 3 percent. Cumulatively, from FY 2006 to FY 2010, CBP assessed 514 IPR penalties and collected $2,114,519 in fines. When collecting civil penalties, CBP is challenged by the fact that businesses who knowingly import counterfeit and pirated goods operate with minimal assets. It is often more efficient for these businesses to shut down their operations and re-open under a new name rather than to pay a fine or penalty. CBP has implemented a number of actions to address this challenge and ensure that the expenses that CBP must incur in order to collect the penalties do not exceed the amount collected.
To enhance deterrence of IPR theft, CBP is implementing new procedures for issuing civil penalties under 19 U.S.C. 1526(f). Currently, these penalties are usually issued to the U.S. importer or consignee. Under new guidelines, we will penalize persons who direct, assist financially or otherwise, or who aid and abet the importation of merchandise seized for bearing a counterfeit mark to the full extent allowed under the law.
In addition, CBP is changing its IPR penalty process so that we issue the penalties concurrently with the seizure of the counterfeit goods rather than waiting for the forfeiture proceeding to be complete, which can delay the issuance of penalties for up to two years.
In a corresponding effort, CBP is collaborating with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to identify ways to enhance the quality of IPR penalty cases and to ensure that CBP’s IPR penalty cases are referred to DOJ for judicial action.
From FY 2005 through FY 2011 to date, CBP has completed 85 audits of importers at high risk for IPR violations, primarily known IPR violators. These audits have resulted in penalties, which are assessed under 19 U.S.C. § 1595a(b) and based on domestic value, of $12.3 million for IPR infringements. Of the 85 importers audited for IPR violations, only 16 importers, or 19 percent, subsequently imported shipments of counterfeit goods. Thus, the IPR Audit Program has had the positive impact of deterring 81 percent of these importers from committing IPR violations.
CBP is a leading source of referrals to ICE for possible criminal investigation of IPR infringement. As a participating agency in the National IPR Coordination Center (IPR Center), CBP leverages our targeting and interdiction successes to contribute to special operations. For example, CBP, in conjunction with FBI and ICE, initiated Operation Network Raider in May 2010, which targets the illegal distribution of counterfeit network hardware manufactured in China. To date, referrals from this operation to ICE for criminal investigation have resulted in 30 felony convictions and 700 seizures of counterfeit Cisco network hardware. CBP is also participating in the recently announced IPR Center Operation Chain Reaction, a multi-agency effort to protect the military’s supply chain from being infiltrated by counterfeit goods.
Modernization
Increasing CBP’s IPR enforcement capabilities will lead to increased interdiction of infringing goods, and deterring future violations will positively impact the economy and protect the safety and security of Americans.
As I previously noted, in June 2010, the IPEC issued the Administration’s first Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement (JSP), which was developed in coordination with many federal agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State, Commerce, Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Trade Representative. As part of the JSP, the Administration reviewed existing laws to ensure that they were effective and did not hinder enforcement. Based on that review, in March 2011 the Administration issued a white paper identifying specific legislative recommendations to increase the effectiveness of IPR enforcement efforts. One of these recommendations is to give DHS the authority to share information with right holders prior to the seizure of goods to help determine whether products are infringing.
This recommendation recognizes that right holders know their products better than anyone and can provide valuable information to assist CBP in determining the authenticity of suspect goods. However, CBP also has an obligation and long-standing history of providing appropriate safeguards for importers importing legitimate products. In this regard, CBP strongly supports policies providing us with the ability to share information and samples of suspected counterfeit and piratical goods with right holders in order to assist with making such a determination.
Conclusion
Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, and distinguished Members of the Judiciary Committee, as you know the trade in counterfeit and pirated goods threatens America’s innovation-based economy, the competitiveness of our businesses, the livelihoods of U.S. workers, our national security, and the health and safety of our consumers.
I thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today to present an overview of CBP’s actions to ensure that American intellectual property is protected and that imports comply with our nation’s laws. We recognize that we have an important obligation to prevent any abuse of our open marketplace, and we take our role in this process very seriously.
I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

Homeland Subcommittee Ranking Member Rogers Statement on the Democrats’ Last-Minute, Flawed Border Security Spending Bill
Apr 12, 2011 Press Release
Homeland Subcommittee Ranking Member Rogers Statement on the Democrats’ Last-Minute, Flawed Border Security Spending Bill
  WASHINGTON, D.C. – The House today considered last-minute, hastily crafted legislation to provide funding for increased homeland security resources for border areas in the U.S. The legislation was unveiled just this morning, was not considered by any committee, has several critical policy flaws, and is being jammed through by the Democrat majority before the House recesses for the August work period this week.
   House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee Ranking Member Hal Rogers gave the following statement in opposition to the flawed bill:
  “Let me start by saying that I take a back seat to no one on border security. I’ve read the intelligence reports. I’ve had the briefings. I’ve led and supported robust funding for Coast Guard, CBP, ICE, DoJ, and local law enforcement agencies. I’ve implored – practically begged – the White House and the Democrat Majority to recognize the spill-over violence from this heinous drug war raging in Mexico. I’ve pushed for a new joint command along the Southwest border. And finally, I’ve been first in line calling for a serious, sustained approach to breaking the backs of the cartels and enforcing our immigration laws.
  “Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, this bill is not a serious, sustained response.  Rather, this is little more than a cynical knee-jerk, political ploy. I have three concerns with this bill: First, this “suspension” bill is not paid for.  At a time of record deficit spending, why can’t we at least attempt to find the prudent offsets necessary to address our nation’s border security needs? Second, this bill circumvents regular order – these expenditures should be considered as part of the FY11 Homeland Security process.  The very same process that was derailed by the majority yesterday via the last minute cancellation of our full committee markup. Third, and perhaps most disappointing, this bill is woefully inadequate and the wrong mix of security – leaving gaping holes at the Judiciary, CBP and the Coast Guard.  If we’re going to do this, let’s do it right.
  “$500 million out of the bill’s $701 million price tag is borrowed money.  So, in many ways, this bill is addressing one urgent security issue and creating another. While border security is indeed a priority, our skyrocketing debt and continued deficit spending have the makings of a genuine national security crisis.
We can no longer ignore our debt, continue to recklessly spend, call everything an “emergency”, and simply hope it will go away.  We must make the tough, disciplined decisions at every level and on every issue. So, these border security enhancements can and should be paid for via responsible offsets.
  “More to this point, why can’t we consider these obvious funding needs as part of the FY11 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill?  The majority took six months to consider a true emergency – funding our troops – and sent that bill through a tangled, politicized labyrinth.  The White House only woke up to this drug violence in June with a haphazard request.  Which begs the question, where is the Administration’s and Democrat majority’s commitment to security?
  “Instead, yesterday, the Democrat majority cancelled the full committee markup of the FY11 bill just ten minutes before it was scheduled to begin.  And, for what?  So that we can turn to this suspension bill, borrow more money, and then ignore all of the other vital homeland security issues for the coming year?  Addressing the critical needs facing our nation’s aviation security, immigration enforcement, disaster response, and cyber security are now left dead in the water, with little hope of resurrection.
  “Or, was the last minute cancellation of the markup for some other, more political reason like the fact that Arizona’s new, tough immigration enforcement law is in the midst of a contentious law suit?
  “Madam Speaker, the murderous drug war along the border demands serious solutions; not reckless spending, a flawed process, and political games.
  “As it were, I was prepared to offer a responsible, completely offset amendment at markup that would have achieved this goal and included many of Chairman Obey’s ideas.  And, the minority was prepared to take a strong stand in defense of the Arizona immigration enforcement law – a law that simply makes being illegally present in the United States against the law.  Sadly, thanks to the dictatorial tactics of the Democrat majority, we don’t get a chance to offer – let alone debate – these sound amendments.
  “So, let’s get our border security right. Let’s provide the right mix of enforcement resources to combat the ruthless drug cartels, but let’s do so through regular order in a fiscally responsible way.
  “This bill – just like President Obama’s flawed request – neglects our counter-smuggling needs in the source and transit zones, fails to fully address aerial surveillance shortfalls, and ignores the Judicial resources required to follow through on enforcement actions.
  “If only the Democrat majority would be willing to take up the regular FY11 DHS and CJS appropriations bills, we could consider and debate the improvement of our border security in such a way that all of these issues could be addressed, and paid for. 
  “Sadly, that is not the case here today. So, I have grave reservations about this bill and this process.  While I wholeheartedly believe we can and must do more to shore up our porous border, I believe we can do far better.”

Testimony of Donna Bucella, Assistant Commissioner, Office of Intelligence and Operations Coordination, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery and Intergovernmental Affairs on ""Exploring Drug Gangs' Ever Evolving Tactics to Penetrate the Border and the Federal Government's Efforts to Stop Them""
Release Date: March 31, 2011
Dirksen Senate Office Building
Introduction
Chairman Pryor, Ranking Member Ensign, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, it is a pleasure to appear before you today to discuss U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) efforts to secure our nation's borders.
As America's frontline border agency, CBP is responsible for securing America's borders against threats while facilitating legal travel and trade. To do this, CBP has deployed a multi-layered, risk-based approach to enhance the security of our borders while facilitating the flow of lawful people and goods entering the United States. This layered approach to security reduces our reliance on any single point or program that could be compromised. It also extends our zone of security outward, ensuring that our physical border is not the first or last line of defense, but one of many.
I'd like to begin by recognizing those at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) who have given their lives in service to our nation. The loss of these brave agents and officers is a stark reminder of the sacrifices made by the men and women of DHS every day. It also strengthens our resolve to continue to do everything in our power to protect against, mitigate, and respond to threats and secure our border.
Overview of Border Security Efforts
Over the past two years, DHS has dedicated historic levels of personnel, technology, and resources to the Southwest border. In March 2009, DHS launched the Southwest Border Initiative to bring unprecedented focus and intensity to Southwest border security, coupled with a smart and effective approach to enforcing immigration laws in the interior of our country. We have increased the size of the Border Patrol to more than 20,700 agents today, more than double the size it was in 2004. DHS also quintupled deployments of Border Liaison Officers to work with their Mexican counterparts and began screening more vehicle traffic and 100 percent of southbound rail to look for illegal weapons and cash that, when smuggled across the border, help to fuel the cartel violence in Mexico.
With funding provided by the enacted Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Border Security Supplemental, we are continuing to add technology, manpower, and infrastructure to the Southwest border, including 1,000 new Border Patrol agents; 250 new CBP officers at our ports of entry (POEs); improving our tactical communications systems; and adding two new forward operating bases to improve coordination of border security activities. The Supplemental also provided CBP two new Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), further strengthening our UAS operations, which now cover the Southwest border from the California-Arizona border to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas.
We've also constructed 649 miles of fencing of the 652 miles that Border Patrol field commanders determined are operationally required, including 299 miles of vehicle barriers and 350 miles of pedestrian fence.
While there is still work to be done, every key measure shows we are making significant progress along the Southwest border. Border Patrol apprehensions—an indicator of illegal immigration—have decreased 36 percent in the past two years, and are less than a third of what they were at their peak. We have matched these decreases in apprehensions with increases in seizures of cash, drugs, and weapons—demonstrating the effectiveness of our layered approach to security. Violent crime in border communities has remained flat or fallen in the past decade, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Report, and some of the safest communities in America are at the border. In fact, violent crimes in Southwest border counties overall have dropped by more than 30 percent and are currently among the lowest in the nation per capita, even as drug-related violence has significantly increased in Mexico.
Nonetheless, we acknowledge that there is still work to do. We remain concerned about the drug cartel violence taking place in Mexico and continue to stand vigilant against spillover effects into the United States. We will continue to assess and support the investments in the manpower, technology and resources that have proven so effective over the past two years in order to keep our borders secure and the communities along it safe.
We are also concerned about the increasing influence of Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) over U.S.-based gangs as a way to expand their domestic distribution process. Gang members are heavily involved in the domestic distribution of the narcotics and to a much lesser extent, the actual movement of contraband across the Southwest border. The Mexican Mafia and Barrio Aztecas are two examples of U.S.-based gangs with significant ties to Mexican DTOs that operate on both sides of the border. In an effort to combat the threat of transnational criminal gangs, CBP developed the Anti-Gang Initiative (AGI). The AGI is a multi-year strategic plan to combat transnational criminal gangs. It focuses on the effective management and coordination of CBP personnel, systems, and resources to detect, disrupt, and interdict criminal gang members and their illicit cross-border activities.
The CBP Office of Intelligence and Operations Coordination (OIOC) supports AGI efforts by facilitating the sharing of intelligence generated by multiple federal, state and local agencies. OIOC assets are embedded within both the Operations Section-Gangs located within the Special Operations Division at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the FBI's National Gang Intelligence Center. As a contributing member to both these gang-focused operations, CBP has access to operational intelligence that is generated not only by the DEA, but by our other law enforcement partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Marshals Service, Bureau of Prisons, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Overview of Smuggling Methods
CBP's mission is complex and challenging. Vast expanses of remote and rugged terrain between our POEs, coupled with the large volumes of trade and traffic at our POEs, are targeted for exploit by smugglers and other cross-border criminal organizations. Smugglers use a wide range of ever evolving methods to attempt to move their illicit goods into the U.S. both at and between our POEs, including the subterranean movement of contraband by way of tunnels. These illicit goods include people, weapons, cash, narcotics and other contraband, which are concealed on people, in vehicles, in cargo, on aircraft and marine vessels. On a typical day, CBP seizes 5,154 kilograms (11,362 pounds) of drugs and $403,066 in undeclared or illicit currency. The Southwest border is the primary entry point for cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine entering the United States.
To meet the challenges of the complex environments in which we operate and address the evolving smuggling techniques we encounter, the CBP OIOC monitors, collects, analyzes and produces intelligence reporting on drug smuggling tactics, techniques, and procedures. In addition, OIOC analysts disseminate information and intelligence from our federal, state, local, tribal and international partners to CBP operational components. This reporting provides our field leadership and frontline personnel with a better understanding of the illicit transportation methods and concealment techniques they are likely to encounter. This information is also used at all levels of the organization to assess the effectiveness of our interdiction operations.
To detect this contraband in vehicles and other conveyances, CBP employs a wide-range of interdiction methods to include behavioral observation, fiber-optic scopes, and non-intrusive inspection (NII) technologies, as well as the intuition of our well-trained officers and agents. NII technologies, to include large scale X-ray and Gamma-ray imaging systems, are an important part of our layered enforcement strategy. These technologies are deployed at our nation's air, sea and land border POEs to screen and identify anomalies that may indicate the presence of contraband or other illegal materials. These NII technologies are force multipliers that enable us to scan or examine a larger portion of the people, conveyances and cargo entering and exiting the U.S. for the presence of contraband, while continuing to facilitate the flow of legitimate trade and travel. NII technologies also give CBP the capability to perform thorough examinations of conveyances and cargo without having to resort to the costly, time-consuming, and intrusive process of manually searching, drilling or dismantling.
NII technologies are also the only effective means of screening the large volume of rail traffic entering the United States from Mexico. CBP currently has eight rail imaging systems deployed to the eight Southwest border commercial rail crossings. These rail systems currently provide CBP with the capability to image and scan 100 percent of all commercial rail traffic arriving in the United States from Mexico. The rail NII imaging technology is bi-directional which provides CBP with the added capability to image southbound trains. In March 2009, CBP began conducting 100 percent outbound screening of rail traffic departing the United States for Mexico for the presence of contraband, such as explosives, weapons and currency.
Through funding received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, CBP has procured one high-energy integrated rail replacement system for deployment to the Southwest border. The system, a dual function radiography/radiation detection unit, is currently undergoing testing and evaluation at the manufacturer's location. CBP anticipates deploying this system in FY 2011.
Due to increased CBP land and air interdiction efforts along the U.S.-Mexico border, drug and human smuggling and trafficking organizations are increasingly turning to maritime smuggling routes to transport their illegal cargo into the United States. Mexican smuggling organizations use a variety of methods to enter the United States via maritime routes, including the use of small wooden fishing vessels. These small, wood, locally built fishing vessels attempt to evade detection by CBP and U.S. Coast Guard surface patrol vessels and patrol aircraft by transporting illegal cargo to the United States at night.
Mexican smuggling organizations also use pleasure boats in a number of areas in an attempt to blend in with legitimate boaters and transport illegal cargo during broad daylight. Smuggling operations utilizing this technique rely on the sheer number of similar pleasure boats on U.S. waters on any given day to ""blend-in.""
A third method of smuggling illegal cargo into the U.S. is through the use of small commercial fishing and shrimping vessels in areas where there are commercial fishing fleets. Similar to the pleasure boat smuggling outlined above, this smuggling method relies on ""blending-in"" with normal boating traffic in an effort to elude detection.
Mexican smuggling organizations also attempt to transport illegal cargo across rivers via high-speed vessels. The limited crossing distance in many areas means that these high-speed vessels can cross in a matter of seconds. To counter this threat, CBP has an array of marine vessels assigned to its riverine patrol stations and additionally use a wide array of shore-side sensors and agents in high-threat areas.
To counter the maritime smuggling threat posed by Mexican smuggling organizations, CBP uses a mix of coastal interceptor and riverine patrol vessels equipped with marine surface search radars and electro optic infrared sensors. These vessels and the CBP marine crews who operate them are on the water 24 hours a day and seven days a week, identifying and intercepting Pangas and Shark boats – pleasure and fishing boats used by Mexican smuggling organizations. Additionally, CBP Office of Air and Marine uses an array of patrol aircraft equipped with marine search radars to conduct periodic patrols of the maritime approaches to the United States.
As CBP continues to expand its control of the border, smugglers are using new methods in attempts to push their illicit cargo into the U.S. One such method being used is the ultralight aircraft. Ultralights have been discovered performing airdrops, as well as landings, to pass off their cargo. During FY 2010, there were 228 confirmed events with ultralight aircraft, with 22 narcotics seizures, 12 arrests, and 5 ultralight aircrafts seized. Currently, the Air and Marine Operations Center uses their capabilities, as well as those of the Department of Defense and civilian radar capabilities to identify and track suspect ultralight aircraft incursions. CBP is also working to procure a radar solution specifically designed to detect ultralight aircraft.
An additional smuggling method is the use of tunnels under the international border. The first tunnel was discovered by the U.S. Border Patrol in 1990, and CBP has seen an increase of tunneling activity in the past few years. To date, there have been a total of 133 tunnels discovered crossing under the international border —132 of which have been on the Southwest border with one discovered along the Northern border near Lynden, Washington, in July 2005. Tunnels have ranged from highly sophisticated to rudimentary. When tunnels are detected, each Southwest border sector follows established protocols for notification, investigation, and remediation. CBP is working with DHS's Science and Technology Directorate to test and ultimately deploy tunnel detection technology in support of CBP's operations.
In November 2010, the San Diego Tunnel Task Force discovered two tunnels and seized more than 50 tons of marijuana. The first tunnel, discovered on November 2, 2010, was a 600-yard underground cross-border passageway equipped with rail, lighting, and ventilation systems. Surveillance operations and collaboration with Mexican law enforcement led to the discovery of this tunnel and resulted in the seizure of 30 tons of marijuana. The second tunnel, which was discovered on November 26, 2010, was even more sophisticated and included reinforced supports, advanced rail, electrical, and ventilation systems. This tunnel discovery resulted in the arrest of eight individuals and the seizure of more than 20 tons of marijuana. The two discoveries are the result of collaboration between CBP and ICE, along with other agencies and use of state-of-the-art electronic surveillance technology to investigate cross-border smuggling by criminal organizations.
Working Together to Thwart Smuggling
In addition to the tools that CBP utilizes to thwart smuggling attempts, CBP works with our federal, state, local, tribal and international partners to address smuggling along the Southwest border and to combat transnational threats.
CBP hosts a weekly briefing/teleconference with state and local partners regarding the current state of the border. These calls are designed to establish and refine a mechanism to monitor emerging trends and threats along the Southwest border with a specific focus on the Arizona corridors, and to provide a cross-component, multi-agency venue for discussing trends and threats.
The weekly briefing focuses on CBP narcotics, weapons, and currency interdictions and alien apprehensions both at and between the POEs across the Southwest border. These briefings/teleconferences currently include over 290 participants representing agencies and units across law enforcement, Department of Defense, and the intelligence community. Examples of participants include: U.S. Coast Guard; DEA; ICE; National Drug Intelligence Center; U.S. Northern Command; Joint Interagency Task Force-North; Joint Interagency Task Force-South; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Attorneys' Offices; Canada Border Services Agency; Naval Investigative Command; State Fusion Centers; and local law enforcement.
Moreover, CBP has increased partnerships with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies and our Mexican counterparts, as well as with the public and private sectors. Coordination and cooperation among all entities that have a stake in our mission have been, and continue to be, paramount to an effective Southwest border strategy. CBP is working closely with federal, state, local, tribal and international partners to increase intelligence and information sharing. A Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination cell has been established at the Air and Marine facilities in Riverside, California, and Grand Forks, North Dakota, to provide essential information to law enforcement across the nation—increasing understanding of evolving threats and providing the foundation for law enforcement entities to exercise targeted enforcement in the areas of greatest risk. This intelligence-driven approach prioritizes emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and risks, which greatly enhances our border security efforts.
An example of our collaborative efforts along the Southwest border is the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats (ACTT) in Arizona. ACTT is a collaborative enforcement effort, established in September 2009, that leverages the capabilities and resources of more than 70 federal, state, local, and tribal agencies in Arizona and the Government of Mexico to combat individuals and criminal organizations that pose a threat to communities on both sides of the border. Through ACTT, we work with our federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners to increase collaboration; enhance intelligence and information sharing; and develop coordinated operational plans that strategically leverage the unique missions, capabilities and jurisdictions of each participating agency. Since its inception, ACTT has resulted in the seizure of more than 725,747 kilograms (1.6 million pounds) of marijuana, 1,723 kilograms (3,800 pounds) of cocaine, and 453 kilograms (1,000 pounds) of methamphetamine; the seizure of more than $13 million in undeclared U.S. currency and 268 weapons; nearly 14,000 aliens denied entry to the U.S. at Arizona POEs due to criminal background or other disqualifying factors; and approximately 270,000 apprehensions between POEs.
In addition to the work that we do with our state, local, and other federal partners, President Obama authorized the temporary deployment of up to 1,200 National Guard troops to the Southwest border to contribute additional capabilities and capacity to assist law enforcement agencies as a bridge to longer-term enhancements in the efforts to target illicit networks' trafficking in people, drugs, illegal weapons, money, and the violence associated with these illegal activities. These National Guard troops are providing Entry Identification Teams and criminal investigation analysts in support of these efforts. Their support has allowed us to bridge the gap and hire the additional agents to support the Southwest border, as well as field additional technology and communications capabilities that Congress so generously provided.
Beyond these measures, in recent months we have taken additional steps to bring greater unity to our enforcement efforts, expand coordination with other agencies, and improve response times. In February, we announced the Arizona Joint Field Command—an organizational realignment that brings together Border Patrol, Air and Marine, and Field Operations under a unified command structure to integrate CBP's border security, commercial enforcement, and trade facilitation missions to more effectively meet the unique challenges faced in the Arizona area of operations. We also are improving coordination with military forces on the Southwest border. In partnership with the DEA, and with support from the Department of Defense, DHS is standing up the new Border Intelligence Fusion Section (BIFS) in the El Paso Intelligence Center, which will integrate and synthesize all available Southwest border intelligence from our federal, state, local, tribal and international partners to create a common intelligence picture to support border enforcement activities on the Southwest border. By disseminating real-time operational intelligence to our law enforcement partners in the region, BFIS will streamline and enhance coordinated federal, state, local, and tribal operations along the border. Additionally, we are continuing to work with Mexico to develop an interoperable, cross-border communications network that will improve our ability to coordinate law enforcement and public safety issues.
Additionally, CBP participates in ICE-led Border Enforcement Security Taskforces (BESTs), which are composed of federal, local and international law enforcement stakeholders. BESTs currently operate in 21 locations, including 11 along the Southwest border. BESTs bring federal, state, local, territorial, tribal, and foreign law enforcement together to work to increase security along the border. In FY 2010, BESTs made 1,616 criminal arrests and 907 administrative arrests; helped bring 868 indictments; and helped secure 689 convictions.
Through collaboration and coordination with our many federal, state, local, tribal and international government partners, we have made great strides with regards to the integrity and security of our borders. With your continued assistance, we will continue to refine and further enhance the effectiveness of our detection and interdiction capabilities.
Conclusion
Chairman Pryor, Ranking Member Ensign, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to testify about the work of CBP. We are committed to providing our frontline agents and officers with the tools they need to effectively achieve their primary mission of securing America's borders. I look forward to answering any questions you may have at this time.

Yearbook of Immigration Statistics
Please Note: Older yearbooks and annual flow reports may use outdated terminology but remain as approved.
The Yearbook of Immigration Statistics is a collection of tables that provides data on foreign nationals who, during a fiscal year, were granted lawful permanent residence (i.e., admitted as immigrants or became legal permanent residents), were admitted into the United States on a temporary basis (e.g., tourists, students, or workers), applied for asylum or refugee status, or were naturalized. The Yearbook also presents data on immigration enforcement actions, including noncitizen apprehensions, removals, and returns. The Yearbook tables are released as they become available. A final PDF is released in September of the following fiscal year.
In addition to the Yearbook, the Office of Homeland Security Statistics' Annual Flow Reports and Annual Reports provide text, tables, and charts on legal permanent residents, refugees and asylees, nonimmigrant admissions, naturalizations, and enforcement actions. The Annual Flow Reports and Annual Reports have replaced the text chapters in the earlier editions of the Yearbook.

Border Security
Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism - Mutual Recognition
Mutual Recognition (MR) refers to those activities associated with the signing of a document of arrangement between U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and a foreign Customs Administration that provides the platform for the exchange of membership information and recognizes the compatibility of the respective supply chain security program.  The document, referred to as an “arrangement”, indicates that the security requirements or standards of the foreign industry partnership program, as well as its verification procedures, are the same or similar to those of the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) program.  Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRA), therefore, are bilateral understandings between two Customs Administrations.
The essential concept of MR is that CTPAT and the foreign Customs Administration program have established a standard set of security requirements which allows one business partnership program to recognize the validation findings of the other program which benefits both Customs Administrations and the private sector participants.
The goal of MR is to link the various international industry partnership programs together to collaborate and create a unified and sustainable security posture that assists in securing and facilitating global cargo trade.  Mutual Recognition promotes end-to-end supply chain security based on program membership.
The CTPAT MR process involves four (4) phases:
A side-by-side comparison of the program requirements and an overview of the implemented Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) program. This is designed to determine if the programs align on basic principles and to determine if there is a security aspect in the AEO program.
A pilot program of joint validation/observation visits. This is designed to determine if the programs align in basic practice.
The signing of an MRA.
The development of MR operational procedures, primarily those associated with information sharing. This is also referred to as the implementation phase.
Key Facts:
Currently, MRAs are only based on security. Arrangements do not address Customs compliance issues.
Mutual Recognition can only occur to the extent permitted by law, regulations, and is subject to national security considerations.
Mutual Recognition does not exempt any partner, whether domestic or foreign, from complying with other CBP mandated requirements and cargo enforcement strategies. Importers, for instance, still need to comply with the importer security filing requirements: electronic submittal of the 10+2 trade data elements to CBP 24 hours prior to lading.
Finally, CBP has developed guidance for maintaining the continuity and/or restoring the flow of trade across the Nation’s borders during and after an incident that disrupts the flow of trade at the border ports of entry. Business resumption privileges, however, while envisioned for CTPAT partners, is not a factor that is included in any MRA.
Before CBP engages a foreign Customs Administrations towards Mutual Recognition, four prerequisites must be met:
The foreign Customs Administration must have a full-fledged operational program in place –i.e. not a program in development or a pilot program.
The foreign partnership program must have a strong validation process built into its program.
The foreign partnership program must have a strong security component built into its program.
The foreign Customs Administration must have a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement (CMAA) in place with the US.
Benefits:
Benefits envisioned by an MRA include:
Efficiency: CTPAT will not have to expend resources to send staff overseas to validate a facility that has been certified by a foreign partnership program.
Risk Assessment Tool: The status of the foreign partnership program participant is recognized by CTPAT and is used as a risk-assessment factor. A CTPAT validation visit will be conducted on a different segment of the CTPAT importer’s supply chain.
Less Redundancy/Duplication of Efforts: Foreign companies do not have to go through two separate validation visits. The first validation conducted by the local Customs Administration as the company is initially certified by its business partnership program would be recognized as a CTPAT validation if an MRA is in place.
Common Standard/Trade Facilitation: Companies only have to adhere to one set of security requirements. Avoiding multiple sets of requirements facilitates international trade as shipments will move more efficiently through different countries. Since Mutual Recognition is based on having equally stringent minimum security criteria, a CTPAT compliant company essentially complies with the security criteria of those countries with which the U.S. has reached an MRA. Common standards among programs also aid companies in conducting and documenting their security self-assessments.
Transparency: Closer collaboration among and between Customs Administrations' and their partnership program companies lead to more transparency in international commerce. Similar security platforms and the exchange of information between all of these partners expedite and facilitate the movement of commerce across nations.
Current Status:

Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) is but one layer in U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) multi-layered cargo enforcement strategy. Through this program, CBP works with the trade community to strengthen international supply chains and improve United States border security. CTPAT is a voluntary public-private sector partnership program which recognizes that CBP can provide the highest level of cargo security only through close cooperation with the principle stakeholders of the international supply chain such as importers, carriers, consolidators, licensed customs brokers, and manufacturers. The Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 provided a statutory framework for the CTPAT program and imposed strict program oversight requirements.
A Growing Partnership
From its inception in November 2001, CTPAT continued to grow. Today, more than 11,400 certified partners spanning the gamut of the trade community, have been accepted into the program. The partners include U.S. importers/exporters, U.S./Canada highway carriers; U.S./Mexico highway carriers; rail and sea carriers; licensed U.S. Customs brokers; U.S. marine port authority/terminal operators; U.S. freight consolidators; ocean transportation intermediaries and non‐operating common carriers; Mexican and Canadian manufacturers; and Mexican long‐haul carriers, all of whom account for over 52 percent (by value) of cargo imported into the U.S.
How CTPAT works
When an entity joins CTPAT, an agreement is made to work with CBP to protect the supply chain, identify security gaps, and implement specific security measures and best practices. Applicants must address a broad range of security topics and present security profiles that list action plans to align security throughout the supply chain.
CTPAT members are considered to be of low risk, and are therefore less likely to be examined at a U.S. port of entry.
CTPAT Benefits
CTPAT Partners enjoy a variety of benefits, including taking an active role in working closer with the U.S. Government in its war against terrorism. As they do this, Partners are able to better identify their own security vulnerabilities and take corrective actions to mitigate risks. Some of the benefits of the program include:
Reduced number of CBP examinations
Front of the line inspections
Possible exemption from Stratified Exams
Shorter wait times at the border
Assignment of a Supply Chain Security Specialist to the company
Access to the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) Lanes at the land borders
Access to the CTPAT web-based Portal system and a library of training materials
Possibility of enjoying additional benefits by being recognized as a trusted trade Partner by foreign Customs administrations that have signed Mutual Recognition with the United States
Eligibility for other U.S. Government pilot programs, such as the Food and Drug Administration’s Secure Supply Chain program
Business resumption priority following a natural disaster or terrorist attack
Importer eligibility to participate in the Importer Self-Assessment Program (ISA)
Priority consideration at CBP’s industry-focused Centers of Excellence and Expertise
How Do I Become a Partner?
Join CTPAT Now

Participation in CTPAT is voluntary and there are no costs associated with joining the program. Moreover, a company does not need an intermediary in order to apply to the program and work with CBP; the application process is easy and it is done online. The first step is for the company to review the CTPAT Minimum Security Criteria for their business entity to determine eligibility for the program. The second step is for the company to submit a basic application via the CTPAT Portal system and to agree to voluntarily participate. The third step is for the company to complete a supply chain security profile. The security profile explains how the company is meeting CTPAT’s minimum security criteria. In order to do this, the company should have already conducted a risk assessment. Upon satisfactory completion of the application and supply chain security profile, the applicant company is assigned a CTPAT Supply Chain Security Specialist to review the submitted materials and to provide program guidance on an on-going basis. The CTPAT program will then have up to 90 days to certify the company into the program or to reject the application. If certified, the company will be validated within a year of certification.

Home News Testimony Secretary Napolitano’s Testimony on FY 2010 Budget Request
Testimony of Secretary Napolitano before the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Homeland Security, ""FY 2010 Budget Request"" (Written Testimony)
Release Date: May 12, 2009
Rayburn House Office Building
(Remarks as Prepared)
Mr. Chairman, Congressman Rogers, and Members of the Subcommittee:
Let me begin by saying thank you for the strong support you have consistently shown the Department, and I look forward to working with you to make certain that we have the right resources to protect the homeland and the American people and that we make the most effective and efficient use of those resources.
I am pleased to appear before the Subcommittee today to present President Obama’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Budget Request for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I will also summarize the progress we have made since the start of the new administration along with some of our key accomplishments from last year.
FY 2010 Budget Request
The Department of Homeland Security’s Budget will strengthen current efforts that are vital to the nation’s security, bolster DHS’ ability to respond to emerging and evolving threats, and allow DHS to embrace new responsibilities in order to secure the nation. This Budget puts forward critical investments in the protection of the American people.
DHS and its many component agencies fulfill a broad mandate and conduct many different activities within a single, unified security mission. DHS performs critical tasks from protecting transportation hubs to conducting maritime rescues, from aiding disaster victims to enforcing immigration laws. Within this broad portfolio, the Department aims to secure the American people from all hazards – including terrorist threats and natural or accidental disasters – and to work effectively with its many partners to lead the collaborative effort to secure the nation. DHS undertakes the mission of securing the United States against all threats through five main action areas, each of which is strengthened by this Budget:
Guarding Against Terrorism – Protecting the American people from terrorist threats is the founding purpose of the Department and DHS’ highest priority. This Budget expands DHS efforts to battle terrorism, including detecting explosives in public spaces and transportation networks, helping protect critical infrastructure and cyber networks from attack, detecting agents of biological warfare, and building information-sharing partnerships with state and local law enforcement that can enable law enforcement to mitigate threats.
Securing Our Borders – DHS prevents and investigates illegal movements across our borders, including the smuggling of people, drugs, cash, and weapons. In March, the Department announced a new initiative to strengthen security on the southwest border in order to disrupt the drug, cash and weapon smuggling that fuels cartel violence in Mexico. This Budget strengthens those efforts by adding manpower and technology to the southwest border. This Budget also funds smart security on the northern border and facilitates international travel and trade. The President’s request also makes targeted investments to reduce security risk across our nation’s vast maritime borders.
Smart and Tough Enforcement of Immigration Laws and Improving Immigration Services – DHS welcomes legal immigrants, protects against dangerous people entering the country, and pursues tough, effective enforcement against those who violate the nation’s immigration laws. This Budget contains funding to strengthen our employment eligibility verification systems, target and crack down on criminal aliens and expedite the application process for new legal immigrants.
Preparing for, Responding to, and Recovering from Natural Disasters – The Department must aid local and state first responders in all stages of a natural disaster – preparing for the worst, responding to a disaster that has occurred, and recovering in the long run. This budget contains funding to strengthen DHS assistance for local first responders and the communities and families affected by disasters.
Unifying and Maturing DHS – DHS is a young department. Its components must further evolve in order to operate as effectively as possible as one agency with a single, unified security mission. This Budget contains funding to initiate consolidation of mission support activities that will remain off-site from the St. Elizabeths campus, reducing the many small and widely scattered leased locations and supporting the goal to build “One DHS.”
DHS is employing several cross cutting initiatives to strengthen activities in each of these mission areas.
First, DHS is working across the board to increase cooperation with its partners – state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies, international allies, the private sector, and other federal departments. The effort to secure America requires close coordination and collaboration; this Budget increases resources dedicated to these critical partnerships.
Second, the Department is bolstering its science and technology portfolio. This will lead to the development of new techniques and technologies that will expand DHS’ law enforcement capabilities while minimizing law enforcement’s impact on everyday, law-abiding citizens. This Budget contains important investments in technologies that will allow DHS officers to perform their security tasks more quickly and with greater accuracy.
Third, the Department continually aims for greater efficiency in its operations. Through the Department-wide Efficiency Review Initiative launched in March, DHS is ensuring all its resources are used in the most effective way possible to secure the nation.
The total FY 2010 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security is $55.1 billion in funding; a 5 percent increase over the FY 2009 enacted level excluding supplemental funding. The Department’s FY 2010 gross discretionary budget request (1) is $45.8 billion, an increase of 6 percent over the FY 2009 enacted level excluding emergency funding. The Department’s FY 2010 net discretionary budget request is $42.7 billion.(2)
The following are highlights of the FY 2010 Budget Request:
Guarding Against Terrorism
State and Local Fusion Centers: Full support and staffing by the end of FY 2011 are requested for the 70 identified State and Local Fusion Centers, facilities where information and intelligence is shared between federal, state, local and tribal authorities. Funding is dedicated to IT maintenance, support, and training.
Explosives Detection Systems (EDS) Procurement and Installation: An increase of $565.4 million to accelerate the Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) at the Nation’s airports to ensure 100 percent of all checked baggage is screened with an in-line explosive detection capability system, or a suitable alternative. This funding will support facility modifications, recapitalization efforts, as well as procurement and deployment of electronic baggage screening technology systems.
Bomb Appraisal Officers: $9 million for an additional 109 Bomb Appraisal Officers (BAOs) to provide expertise in the recognition of and response to improvised explosive devices at airports to enhance aviation security. The request will provide BAO coverage at 50 percent more airports including all Category X, I, and II airports, and will provide a BAO in every hub-spoke airport system, and to airports that currently have only one BAO assigned.
Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response Teams: An increase of $50 million is requested to fund 15 Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams dedicated to guarding surface transportation. The VIPR teams contain multi-skilled resources, including Transportation Security Inspectors, canine teams, Transportation Security Officers, Bomb Detection Officers, and Federal Air Marshals. These teams enhance the Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) ability to screen passengers, identify suspicious behavior, and act as a visible deterrent to potential terrorists in surface transportation environments.
Vulnerability Assessments: A $3.0 million increase is requested to provide for new nuclear reactor security consultations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The budget request will also support vulnerability assessment pilot projects, which provide state and local stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities and critical infrastructure resiliency.
Bombing Prevention: $4.2 million is requested to enhance improved, coordinated national bombing prevention and improvised explosive device (IED) security efforts.

Additionally, this funding will provide resources to enhance national awareness of the threat, facilitate multi-jurisdiction planning, and conduct additional capabilities assessments for 132 high-risk urban area detection, deterrence, response, and search elements. These elements include canine units, bomb squads, SWAT teams, and dive teams.
Cybersecurity for the Federal Government: A $75.1 million increase is requested to enable DHS to develop and deploy cybersecurity technologies to counter on-going, real world national cyber threats and apply effective analysis and risk mitigation strategies to detect and deter threats.
Explosives Detection Research: Total funding of $120.8 million, an increase of $24.7 million, is requested to support DHS’ Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) in addressing critical capability gaps in detecting, interdicting, and lessening the impacts of non-nuclear explosives used in terrorist attacks against mass transit, civil aviation, and critical infrastructure. Of the $24.7 million, $10.0 million will develop high-throughput cargo screening technology through automated, more efficient equipment. The remaining $14.7 million will build on FY 2009 efforts to counter the threat of hand-carried improvised explosive devices to mass transit systems by detecting all types of explosive threats such as homemade, commercial, and military explosives.

Through the close alignment with HSPD-12, DHS employees and federal, state, local and private-sector partners will be able to log in to their systems with only a single set of credentials in order to access multiple applications.
Efficiency Review
As the Department highlights its spending priorities in this Budget, it is simultaneously conducting a bold and far-reaching Efficiency Review initiative to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent in the most effective way possible. Efficiency Review encompasses both simple, common-sense reforms and longer-term, systemic changes that will, over time, make DHS a leaner, smarter department better equipped to protect the nation.
I launched the Efficiency Review on March 27, 2009 announcing sixteen department-wide initiatives beginning within 120 days, including:
30 Days:
Eliminate non-mission critical travel and maximize use of conference calls and web-based training and meetings
Consolidate subscriptions to professional publications and newspapers
Minimize printing and distribution of reports and documents that can be sent electronically or posted online
Maximize use of government office space for meetings and conferences in place of renting facilities
60 Days:
Implement an electronic tracking tool for fleet usage data to identify opportunities for alternative fuel usage; heighten vigilance for fraud, waste or abuse; and optimize fleet management
Conduct an assessment of the number of full-time, part-time employees and contractors to better manage our workforce
Utilize refurbished IT equipment (computers and mobile devices) and redeploy the current inventory throughout DHS
Leverage buying power to acquire software licenses for Department-wide usage (estimated savings of $283 million over the next six years)
90 Days:
Develop cross-component training opportunities for employees
Develop a process for obtaining preliminary applicant security background data for candidates referred for final consideration (savings of up to $5,500 per avoided full background check)
As replacements are needed, convert new printers, faxes, and copiers into all-in-one machines (estimated savings of $10 million over five years)
Streamline decision-making processes in headquarters offices to eliminate redundancies
120 Days:
Establish a plan to ensure the DHS workforce has employees sufficient in number and skill to deliver our core mission
As replacements are needed for non-law enforcement vehicles, initiate acquisition and leasing of hybrid vehicles, or alternative-fuel vehicles in cases where hybrids are not feasible (estimated mileage improvement of above 30%)
Maximize energy efficiencies in facility management projects (estimated savings of $3 million a year)
Standardize content for new-employee orientation and mandatory annual training modules department-wide.
I have issued formal guidance to all DHS employees regarding the 30-Day initiatives, and planning for the remaining initiatives is underway. Beyond the first 120 days, Efficiency Review will become a central element of budget development and the long term strategic vision of the Department.
Progress
The initiatives strengthened by this Budget would build atop what the Department has already accomplished since the start of the new administration.
To secure the border, DHS has launched a major new initiative to combat drug, cash and weapons smuggling that support drug cartels in Mexico in their efforts against law enforcement. The initiative includes hundreds of new personnel at the border and increased technological capabilities. These efforts have resulted in significant seizures of smuggled items headed into Mexico.
The Department has distributed $970 million dollars to bolster transit and port security. The Recovery Act signed by President Obama contains $1 billion for the development of new explosives-detection technologies to increase safety at transit hubs and public places. To guard against terrorism, I signed a new agreement with Germany to cooperate in developing new counter-terrorism technologies.
In terms of increasing preparedness for, response to, and recovery from natural disasters, DHS has led the national effort in response to and preparedness for the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. Furthermore, the Department has responded quickly and effectively to severe ice storms in Kentucky, Arkansas, and Missouri, as well as to record flooding on the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota. The Department has also taken critical steps to speed recovery in the Gulf Coast communities still struggling due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, including the extension of critical programs.
The Department has also taken important steps toward building a single identity and culture. The Recovery Act contained $650 million for a new, consolidated headquarters for DHS, which is now scattered in buildings throughout the Washington, D.C. area. In March, I announced a moratorium on new branding for DHS components, which will now all use the established DHS seal.
Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I look forward to answering your questions and to working with you on the FY 2010 Budget Request and other issues.

Testimony of Secretary Napolitano before the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Homeland Security, ""FY 2010 Budget Request"" (Written Testimony)
Release Date: May 12, 2009
Rayburn House Office Building
(Remarks as Prepared)
Mr. Chairman, Congressman Rogers, and Members of the Subcommittee:
Let me begin by saying thank you for the strong support you have consistently shown the Department, and I look forward to working with you to make certain that we have the right resources to protect the homeland and the American people and that we make the most effective and efficient use of those resources.
I am pleased to appear before the Subcommittee today to present President Obama’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Budget Request for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I will also summarize the progress we have made since the start of the new administration along with some of our key accomplishments from last year.
FY 2010 Budget Request
The Department of Homeland Security’s Budget will strengthen current efforts that are vital to the nation’s security, bolster DHS’ ability to respond to emerging and evolving threats, and allow DHS to embrace new responsibilities in order to secure the nation. This Budget puts forward critical investments in the protection of the American people.
DHS and its many component agencies fulfill a broad mandate and conduct many different activities within a single, unified security mission. DHS performs critical tasks from protecting transportation hubs to conducting maritime rescues, from aiding disaster victims to enforcing immigration laws. Within this broad portfolio, the Department aims to secure the American people from all hazards – including terrorist threats and natural or accidental disasters – and to work effectively with its many partners to lead the collaborative effort to secure the nation. DHS undertakes the mission of securing the United States against all threats through five main action areas, each of which is strengthened by this Budget:
Guarding Against Terrorism – Protecting the American people from terrorist threats is the founding purpose of the Department and DHS’ highest priority. This Budget expands DHS efforts to battle terrorism, including detecting explosives in public spaces and transportation networks, helping protect critical infrastructure and cyber networks from attack, detecting agents of biological warfare, and building information-sharing partnerships with state and local law enforcement that can enable law enforcement to mitigate threats.
Securing Our Borders – DHS prevents and investigates illegal movements across our borders, including the smuggling of people, drugs, cash, and weapons. In March, the Department announced a new initiative to strengthen security on the southwest border in order to disrupt the drug, cash and weapon smuggling that fuels cartel violence in Mexico. This Budget strengthens those efforts by adding manpower and technology to the southwest border. This Budget also funds smart security on the northern border and facilitates international travel and trade. The President’s request also makes targeted investments to reduce security risk across our nation’s vast maritime borders.
Smart and Tough Enforcement of Immigration Laws and Improving Immigration Services – DHS welcomes legal immigrants, protects against dangerous people entering the country, and pursues tough, effective enforcement against those who violate the nation’s immigration laws. This Budget contains funding to strengthen our employment eligibility verification systems, target and crack down on criminal aliens and expedite the application process for new legal immigrants.
Preparing for, Responding to, and Recovering from Natural Disasters – The Department must aid local and state first responders in all stages of a natural disaster – preparing for the worst, responding to a disaster that has occurred, and recovering in the long run. This budget contains funding to strengthen DHS assistance for local first responders and the communities and families affected by disasters.
Unifying and Maturing DHS – DHS is a young department. Its components must further evolve in order to operate as effectively as possible as one agency with a single, unified security mission. This Budget contains funding to initiate consolidation of mission support activities that will remain off-site from the St. Elizabeths campus, reducing the many small and widely scattered leased locations and supporting the goal to build “One DHS.”
DHS is employing several cross cutting initiatives to strengthen activities in each of these mission areas.
First, DHS is working across the board to increase cooperation with its partners – state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies, international allies, the private sector, and other federal departments. The effort to secure America requires close coordination and collaboration; this Budget increases resources dedicated to these critical partnerships.
Second, the Department is bolstering its science and technology portfolio. This will lead to the development of new techniques and technologies that will expand DHS’ law enforcement capabilities while minimizing law enforcement’s impact on everyday, law-abiding citizens. This Budget contains important investments in technologies that will allow DHS officers to perform their security tasks more quickly and with greater accuracy.
Third, the Department continually aims for greater efficiency in its operations. Through the Department-wide Efficiency Review Initiative launched in March, DHS is ensuring all its resources are used in the most effective way possible to secure the nation.
The total FY 2010 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security is $55.1 billion in funding; a 5 percent increase over the FY 2009 enacted level excluding supplemental funding. The Department’s FY 2010 gross discretionary budget request (1) is $45.8 billion, an increase of 6 percent over the FY 2009 enacted level excluding emergency funding. The Department’s FY 2010 net discretionary budget request is $42.7 billion.(2)

This funding will support an additional 44 Border Patrol agents and 8 support staff as well as 65 Customs and Border Protection officers and 8 support staff. Resources are also requested to expand and maintain the Licensed Plate Reader (LPR) program to help establish and maintain effective control of the border. Additionally Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requests an additional $70 million to hire 349 positions (specifically Special Agents, Intelligence Analysts, and Criminal Investigators) to increase enforcement staffing, improve cooperative efforts with the Mexican government, and establish another Border Violence Intelligence Cell. This cross-program initiative will increase national security by expanding activities to secure our borders.
Maritime Border Security Enhancements: $700 million is requested to purchase five new Coast Guard Cutters, two Maritime Patrol Aircraft and one aircraft flight simulator to increase surface and air asset presence in the maritime domain and vastly improve threat detection and interdiction capabilities. $103 million is requested to purchase 30 new Coast Guard small boats to replace aging, obsolete assets with more capable, multi-mission platforms. $1.2 million is requested to establish a permanent Biometrics at Sea System, an investment which enables Coast Guard boarding teams to identify dangerous individual documented in the US-VISIT database and yields the type of cross-component operational integration sought through creation of DHS and that must continue to be built upon.
Northern Border Technology: $20.0 million is requested to assist U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in providing improved situational awareness along the northern border through the design, deployment, and integration of surveillance, sensing platforms, detection technologies and tactical infrastructure. This technology will expand DHS capabilities, increase the effectiveness of our agents, and increase the ability to detect unlawful border activity successfully.
CBP Air and Marine (A&M) Personnel: A $19.1 million increase is requested to support Border Patrol agents by providing air cover as well as expanding maritime assistance along the borders. Funding is requested to hire an additional 68 pilots, 20 marine and 56 support personnel. During FY 2010, A&M plans to continue the expansion of its capabilities across the northern and coastal border and place heavy emphasis on the maritime requirements along the southeast and Caribbean borders. The additional personnel resources are requested as new marine vessels are deployed to marine branches at strategic locations along the coastal borders.
Research and Development for Border and Maritime Security: A $7.1 million increase for Science & Technology is requested to fund a new research effort to provide advanced detection, identification, apprehension, and enforcement capabilities along borders, increasing the security of the border and lowering the risk of a successful terrorist attack. Additionally, funding will provide new technologies to the United States Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and other components operating in the maritime environment.
Smart and Tough Enforcement of Immigration Laws and Improving Immigration Services
E-Verify: Total funding of $112 million and 80 new positions are requested to support improvements to the employment eligibility verification system, E-Verify. The growth of the E-Verify program will increase the need for monitoring and compliance activities to protect employees from discriminatory practices, safeguard privacy information, and enhance program efficacy. The FY 2010 program increase is primarily for monitoring and compliance activities, as well as IT-related business initiatives to improve system use.
Secure Communities: Total funding of $39.1 million is requested to hire, train, and equip 80 new enforcement personnel who will identify suspected criminal aliens, determine subjects’ alien status, prioritize ICE enforcement actions against the highest threat criminal aliens, and assist in the removal of apprehended criminal aliens. Funding will also support the continued investment in information technology to improve efficiencies within ICE criminal alien identification prioritization and removal processes.
Detention and Removal Operations Modernization (DROM): Total funding of $25 million is requested for improvements to the system of detaining and removing illegal immigrants. The funding will be dedicated to developing and deploying the Detainee Location Tracking Module as part of the Bed Space and Transportation Management System, expanding the ICE Data warehouse data capacity and reporting capability to support the DRO IT data, and expanding Web services to allow the Electronic Travel Document application to communicate with other internal or external applications. DROM will effect improvements in the areas of real-time dynamic data reporting, detainee management, management of detention beds and tracking detainees, bed-space availability management, and transportation management for improved efficiency in detention and removals.
Law Enforcement Systems Modernization: Total funding of $49 million is requested to fund the ICE Law Enforcement Systems Modernization initiative, including a number of case management, information sharing, and operational support service projects that will improve access to law enforcement information. For example, the case management Traveler Enforcement Communication System (TECS) system modernization effort will support the investigative arm of ICE and update a 20-year-old system, giving ICE improved capabilities for case management, money laundering tracking and reporting, telephone analysis, intelligence reporting and dissemination, Bank Secrecy Act data access, information sharing of subject record data, and statistical/ performance reporting. The funding will also support the design and development for the integration of ICE-Agreements of Cooperation in Communities to Enhance Safety and Security (ACCESS) and Information Sharing.
Immigrant Integration: Total funding of $10 million is requested for an Immigrant Integration program within USCIS, in order to improve the integration of immigrants into the United States. This program allows USCIS and the Office of Citizenship to work across the Federal Government and with state and local governments, U.S. businesses, non-profits, academia, and faith-based organizations to support effective integration efforts across the country. USCIS will provide grants to community-based organizations for citizenship preparation programs; facilitate English language learning through improved web resources; build volunteer capacity by developing a training certification framework for volunteers and, promote citizenship with integration messages at the workplace, among federal agencies, and the general public.
US-VISIT Identity Management and Screening Services: An $11.2 million increase is requested to support the increased workload demands associated with the transition from 2- to 10- fingerprint biometric capture for foreign visitors. The increase will support biometric identifications and verifications, latent print processing, data sharing with other agencies, and the growing Secure Communities initiative, which shares biometric information with local law enforcement. The funding will also support information sharing and technical assistance to select foreign governments to promote the adoption and use of common biometric identity management standards in order to advance the ability to screen travelers to and workers within the United States.
Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI): A $20.9 million increase is requested to continue maintaining and operating the WHTI program that supports Departmental efforts to facilitate the efficient movement of people at the land border POEs. WHTI provides a tool to conduct the necessary authentication at the time of crossing and it also accelerates the verification process mandated by law to the extent possible with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology and communications technology.
Preparing for, Responding to, and Recovering from Natural Disasters
Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM): A $60 million increase is requested for Pre-Disaster Mitigation in the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Funding will assist in the implementation of pre-disaster hazard mitigation measures that are cost-effective and are designed to reduce injuries, loss of life, and damage and destruction of property, including damage to critical services and facilities.
Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants: Total funding of $420 million is requested to double the funds devoted to SAFER grants administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which help fire departments increase the number of frontline firefighters. Funding will enable fire departments to increase their staffing and deployment capabilities, ensuring around the clock protection.
Disaster Relief Fund (DRF): Total DRF funding of $2 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion, is requested. The DRF, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), provides a significant portion of the total federal response to victims in declared major disasters and emergencies. This increase will provide relief for non-catastrophic disaster activity.
First Responder Technology: Total funding of $12 million is requested to develop and design technologies to address capability gaps identified by federal, state, local and tribal first responders. This program will test technologies, assess usability, and commercialize them to increase availability across all first responder communities.
Gap Analysis Program: An additional $3.0 million is requested for the Gap Analysis Program to supplement programs that evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each state's emergency plans and evacuation plans and expand beyond earlier focus on hurricane-prone regions and rural and suburban areas to all hazards.
Maturing and Unifiying DHS
DHS Headquarters Consolidation Project: An additional $75.0 million is requested in FY 2010 to initiate consolidation of mission support activities that will remain off-campus, reducing the amount of small and widely scattered leased locations.
Strategic Requirements Planning Process: An additional $5.0 million and five FTE are requested for the DHS Strategic Requirements Planning Process (SRPP) to establish tangible Department-wide targets and goals to help integrate DHS components’ efforts and ensure that the Department fulfills its homeland security mission. The SRPP is designed to coordinate with the Department’s resource allocation and investment processes and ensure that both of these processes address the most critical homeland security needs and capability gaps. The SRPP is designed to utilize risk assessments to prioritize analysis of capability gaps, and risk would also be used to inform the prioritization of investment in capability gaps and needs identified through the SRPP.
OIG Auditors: An increase of $5.1 million is requested to hire an additional 60 staff. The increase of staffing will better position the Office of Inspector General to assist in supporting the Department’s integrated planning guidance (IPG) of strengthening border security and interior enforcement. In addition, the increase will expand oversight of activities relating to DHS issues on immigration and border security, transportation security, critical infrastructure protection, federal and state/local intelligence sharing, Secure Border Initiative (SBI), and acquisition strategies. The OIG’s oversight activities add value to DHS programs and operations by providing an objective third party assessment to ensure integrity and transparency.
Data Center Development/Migration: A $200.0 million increase is requested to support further migration of component systems, applications and disaster recovery to the DHS Enterprise Data Centers for central DHS management. Select DHS component budgets include funds to migrate their component specific applications to the DHS Data Center. The Data Center consolidation efforts will standardize IT resource acquisitions across DHS components, as well as streamline maintenance and support contracts, allowing for less complex vendor support and expediting response times in the event of an emergency. Benefits derived from consolidation include enhanced IT security, improved information sharing with stakeholders, and enhanced operational efficiencies over time.
Information Security and Infrastructure: $23.0 million is requested to support: Network Security Enhancements, Internet Gateway Enhancements, and Single Sign-On Capability.
Network Security Enhancements: This funding is requested to mitigate high-risk areas within the DHS firewall. This request will establish critical Policy Enforcement Points across the DHS Network, improve DHS Security Operation Center capabilities (i.e., remediation, forensics), and establish robust classified facilities with highly skilled analysts. Network Security Enhancements will identify all internet connections for remediation by migrating separate, legacy component connections behind the DHS Trusted Internet Connections (TICs).
Internet Gateway Enhancements: This request will implement a High Assurance Guard to support mission requirements for accessing social networking sites and establishing the DHS Email Disaster Recovery capability where 100 percent of all e-mail traffic will be behind the two DHS TICs.
Single Sign-On (SSO) Capability: Increased FY 2010 funding will be utilized to initiate the application integration and establishment of the core infrastructures for AppAuth, eAuth, the SSO Gateway, and Service Oriented Architecture required under the SSO project. Through the close alignment with HSPD-12, DHS employees and federal, state, local and private-sector partners will be able to log in to their systems with only a single set of credentials in order to access multiple applications.
Efficiency Review
As the Department highlights its spending priorities in this Budget, it is simultaneously conducting a bold and far-reaching Efficiency Review initiative to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent in the most effective way possible. Efficiency Review encompasses both simple, common-sense reforms and longer-term, systemic changes that will, over time, make DHS a leaner, smarter department better equipped to protect the nation.
I launched the Efficiency Review on March 27, 2009 announcing sixteen department-wide initiatives beginning within 120 days, including:
30 Days:
Eliminate non-mission critical travel and maximize use of conference calls and web-based training and meetings
Consolidate subscriptions to professional publications and newspapers
Minimize printing and distribution of reports and documents that can be sent electronically or posted online
Maximize use of government office space for meetings and conferences in place of renting facilities
60 Days:
Implement an electronic tracking tool for fleet usage data to identify opportunities for alternative fuel usage; heighten vigilance for fraud, waste or abuse; and optimize fleet management
Conduct an assessment of the number of full-time, part-time employees and contractors to better manage our workforce
Utilize refurbished IT equipment (computers and mobile devices) and redeploy the current inventory throughout DHS
Leverage buying power to acquire software licenses for Department-wide usage (estimated savings of $283 million over the next six years)
90 Days:
Develop cross-component training opportunities for employees
Develop a process for obtaining preliminary applicant security background data for candidates referred for final consideration (savings of up to $5,500 per avoided full background check)
As replacements are needed, convert new printers, faxes, and copiers into all-in-one machines (estimated savings of $10 million over five years)
Streamline decision-making processes in headquarters offices to eliminate redundancies
120 Days:
Establish a plan to ensure the DHS workforce has employees sufficient in number and skill to deliver our core mission
As replacements are needed for non-law enforcement vehicles, initiate acquisition and leasing of hybrid vehicles, or alternative-fuel vehicles in cases where hybrids are not feasible (estimated mileage improvement of above 30%)
Maximize energy efficiencies in facility management projects (estimated savings of $3 million a year)
Standardize content for new-employee orientation and mandatory annual training modules department-wide.
I have issued formal guidance to all DHS employees regarding the 30-Day initiatives, and planning for the remaining initiatives is underway. Beyond the first 120 days, Efficiency Review will become a central element of budget development and the long term strategic vision of the Department.
Progress
The initiatives strengthened by this Budget would build atop what the Department has already accomplished since the start of the new administration.
To secure the border, DHS has launched a major new initiative to combat drug, cash and weapons smuggling that support drug cartels in Mexico in their efforts against law enforcement. The initiative includes hundreds of new personnel at the border and increased technological capabilities. These efforts have resulted in significant seizures of smuggled items headed into Mexico.
The Department has distributed $970 million dollars to bolster transit and port security. The Recovery Act signed by President Obama contains $1 billion for the development of new explosives-detection technologies to increase safety at transit hubs and public places. To guard against terrorism, I signed a new agreement with Germany to cooperate in developing new counter-terrorism technologies.
In terms of increasing preparedness for, response to, and recovery from natural disasters, DHS has led the national effort in response to and preparedness for the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. Furthermore, the Department has responded quickly and effectively to severe ice storms in Kentucky, Arkansas, and Missouri, as well as to record flooding on the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota. The Department has also taken critical steps to speed recovery in the Gulf Coast communities still struggling due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, including the extension of critical programs.
The Department has also taken important steps toward building a single identity and culture. The Recovery Act contained $650 million for a new, consolidated headquarters for DHS, which is now scattered in buildings throughout the Washington, D.C. area. In March, I announced a moratorium on new branding for DHS components, which will now all use the established DHS seal.
Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I look forward to answering your questions and to working with you on the FY 2010 Budget Request and other issues.

373,Transcript of Remarks Delivered by Deputy Attorney General Mark R ...,https://www.justice.gov/archive/dag/speeches/2008/dag-speech-080424.html,20082-20082,"Transcript of Remarks Delivered by Deputy Attorney General Mark R. Filip at the U.S. District Courthouse in Tucson, Arizona
Tucson, Arizona
Thursday, April 24, 2008
Thank you, Diane. Good afternoon; it's a pleasure to be here. I am in Arizona today to see for myself the enormous efforts of the Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners in protecting our border. I also brought with me from Washington Ken Melson, the director of our Executive Office for United States Attorneys, who has coordinated our efforts on the border, and has helped orchestrate our push for more resources.
I was sworn in as Deputy Attorney General just last month, and I wanted to get down here as soon as possible, because border issues are among the top priorities of the Department. As Attorney General Mukasey said recently: ""The ability to control who—and what—comes into and out of a country is one of the most important attributes of a sovereign government, and being able to do that is vital to our nation’s security.""
Earlier today, I took a helicopter trip along the border, and visited the port of entry at Nogales, where I met with some of the federal law enforcement officers working on the front line of this struggle.
I was proud to meet them, and I was impressed by what I saw. The challenges being faced by those officers and other law enforcement personnel, by the prosecutors and staff of the U.S. Attorney's office, and by our partners at the state, local and tribal level, are very, very complex, and they are doing an outstanding job.
Nearly half of all alien apprehensions, and half of all marijuana seizures along the border take place here in Arizona. Just last month, a Tucson man was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his part in a scheme to traffic more than 6,000 pounds of marijuana from the border to New York City.
Of course, federal agents and prosecutors here are also responsible for all felony cases on Arizona’s 21 Indian reservations. Including the reservations, national parks, national forests, and the border, 70 percent of the state’s land-area is under federal supervision.
On top of that, Arizona has one of the five most populous cities in the country, with its own urban issues that are quite different from the problems seen in more rural areas. I salute the men and women here for their hard work on all these issues.
My other purpose in coming here today is to announce the distribution of some of those resources I mentioned earlier, specifically $7 million for the five border districts, to support security and immigration enforcement efforts. This money will fund 64 new Assistant U.S. Attorneys and 35 new contract support positions for the districts. But more than just numbers, these funds are a demonstration of the importance of border issues.
Congress appropriated this money because they recognize, as the Department of Justice does, the specific need to target border issues. In an effort to make the most of those dollars, we asked U.S. Attorneys, including Diane Humetewa, to work with their law enforcement partners in the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, to strategically attack criminal activity on the border.
Diane has been U.S. Attorney for just a short time, but she is concerned about these issues, and dedicated to finding the best possible solutions, as am I.
These are targeted resources, requested by each district, and they are emblematic of the Department's approach of a comprehensive but flexible strategy. Those of us in Washington are well aware that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problems faced on the border—what works in one district or sector may not work in another. Law enforcement professionals here in Arizona are the experts who know this area, and know what will work best here.
For the District of Arizona, that means an allocation of 21 new Assistant U.S. Attorneys, and about a dozen additional support positions. That's a significant increase from the current 133 Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the district. These new prosecutors will handle cases like drug and gun smuggling, illegal entry and reentry, worksite enforcement, and false documents.
In addition to these funds, which are available immediately and for the next two years, the Department has requested in its fiscal year 2009 budget another $100 million to help fight criminal activity along the border as part of our Southwest Border Enforcement Initiative.
The Department of Justice and this U.S. Attorney's Office have always pursued large-scale drug smugglers on the border, along with smaller cases involving repeat offenders and other serious violators. We remain committed to that effort. This new money, and the positions it will fund, means that we will be able to prosecute even more cases than before, targeting smugglers both large and small.
It means that Operation Arizona Denial can take more cases, prosecute more people for illegal entry to break the smuggling cycle, and send the message that ignoring the border just got a whole lot riskier. The success of that operation is due in large part to the partnership and hard work of the U.S. Border Patrol together with our U.S. Attorney's Office; further evidence that we achieve our best results when we work together.
And it means that we can boost our efforts against the traffic in illegal firearms heading south, a deadly trade that leads to more violence on both sides of the border. Our Project Gunrunner, led by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, aims to deprive criminals of the weapons that threaten our communities. In this and other initiatives, the Department of Justice has been working closely with our Mexican counterparts to do all we can to stop gun smugglers.
The men and women of the Department of Justice, with our partners at all levels, and on both sides of the border, are doing a fantastic job in tough conditions. Exactly how tough was brought home to us on January 19th, when Senior Patrol Agent Luis Aguilar, of the Yuma Border Patrol Station, was killed trying to stop a suspected smuggler. His tragic death is a reminder that border issues are serious, and need to be taken seriously.
I thank all the men and women of law enforcement for their hard work, and I'm glad to have the chance to bring them some much-needed resources to help in their fight.
I'll be happy to take your questions now.
QUESTION: Given the burden in the courts now, the prosecution, is there any discussion from your office or otherwise to increase the number of judges to help speed the flow of these cases?
MR. FILIP: I don’t want to insult your intelligence; I am sure that you appreciate that the Department of Justice doesn’t get to decide the number of judges there are. But the issue I am glad you asked that question, it’s a very rare issue, Congress has dedicated a lot of resources to addressing border concerns, the President has as well, its important that the judiciary, when you address any law enforcement issue the response is almost organic and so the judicial component of that will have to be very thoughtfully considered in Washington by people who make those decisions and we’ll certainly be prepared to answer those questions if posed to us by those decision makers about additional judicial resources that might be appropriate.
QUESTION: But it’s something you would like to see happen?
MR. FILIP: It is having … having an appropriate judicial resources in any district is very important, and the judges here in Arizona and all of the Southwest Border districts carry some of the highest case loads in the nation.
QUESTION: Is there a backlog right now? I mean … is there a slow process in terms of judication? And is this the answer to fix that?
MR. FILIP: I think that. No I don’t think it’s a backlog, in terms of if I think there are cases that aren’t being worked on by diligent hard working people. The problem typically, or the issue typically in law enforcement is that we don’t believe that we’ve gotten everyone who is engaging in criminal activity and by devoting these resources, we will be able to provide a more comprehensive approach. For example, on firearms trafficking that is going on. It’s not that we have everybody who we think is out there and it’s just taking a bit longer than we’d hoped to get them due process and have their cases resolved one way or another.
QUESTION: But how does getting prosecutors fix that?
MR. FILIP: Because the law enforcement organism, if you will, is comprehensive. Having just simply arresting people by police officers or law enforcement agents is only the first step. It then sets off responsibilities. People need to be prosecuted in accordance with due process and the courts, judges hear those cases, defense attorneys participate, people need to humanely house those people in prisons, and have space to do that. It’s a very comprehensive situation that needs to be addressed comprehensively.
QUESTION: How many more cases do you think the attorneys will be able to handle on a daily basis?
MR. FILIP: You know; that question is the sort of question that we are designed to leave to local prosecutors to decide.
QUESTION: Do you know what the numbers are currently?
MR. FILIP: I believe it’s 60 a day.
QUESTION: (inaudible) as it relates to border issue crimes?
MR. FILIP: Operation Arizona Denial is a particular type of misdemeanor prosecution of non-violent entries; so it would be 60 of those sorts of cases. There’s thousands of cases of other sorts prosecuted in the district.
QUESTION: So, the main thing is, bringing more prosecutions of border-related crimes of all sorts – gun running, drug smuggling, and (inaudible)?
MR. FILIP: To the extent there are cases where people are … we believe them to be guilty, absolutely. I mean, we don’t bring cases if we don’t think the person’s guilty, obviously. But it’s … it’s more comprehensive than that. Oftentimes, when law enforcement officers engage in their investigative efforts, it is of necessity … it’s necessary for attorneys to be involved in the planning of those investigations to make sure people’s constitutional rights are respected, to make sure that the case that’s brought in court ultimately can succeed. So they would certainly be involved in court-room prosecutions in the way that might be most commonly known, but they’d also be involved in the investigative phases as appropriate.
QUESTION: (inaudible) marijuana trafficking, there’s some perception that the threshold for prosecution is quite high. Does that mean that the threshold is going to go down and we’ll see more cases (inaudible)?
MR. FILIP: I’m extraordinarily grateful that you asked that question because I think that there’s been a misperception about that. When cases are evaluated for marijuana prosecutions here in Arizona, as in most places in the country with which I’m familiar, it’s typically done on the basis of any number of factors. One of those, as reflected in Federal criminal statutes and the sentencing guidelines is to look at the weight of narcotics involved. That’s only one factor. Sometimes weight alone can justify a prosecution. But, in addition, you would always look at the criminal history of the arrestee, whether a firearm was involved, whether it involved endangering children, things of that sort. So that’s always been the operative metric here in the District of Arizona. These additional prosecutors, one might conclude, although this decision will be left to Diane and her career people here, could allow for even more cases involving lower weights than might otherwise have been prosecuted before. But the fundamental idea that there is an extraordinarily high amount of weight and that below that someone is somehow immunized, that’s a falsehood I would hope to dispel.
QUESTION: The resources you are announcing today will enable prosecutors to (inaudible) in Operation Streamline (inaudible)?
MR. FILIP: That’s something, I think, that you need to direct to Diane because we don’t micromanage stuff that way – by design.
QUESTION: Several of your counterparts in the Texas area have made the case that the smuggling trade has a tremendous amount of money and resources to be able to operate and that there’s so much money that there has to be necessarily corruption north of the border as well as south of the border. I wonder whether or not you felt that that was an adequate description (inaudible)?
MR. FILIP: I don’t want to speculate. I will say this. Both in my own personal experience, in Judge Mukasey’s experience, and in our vision for what the Justice Department will do – if there is corruption, including corruption by law enforcement officers, it will be prosecuted. And it certainly would be appropriately prosecuted here if it exists. But the vast, vast majority of law enforcement officers in America are among the most honorable people in the country. But where people have crossed the line and are engaging in illicit conduct, our prosecution of them furthers the law enforcement mission, it doesn’t undermine it.
QUESTION: Sir, what would you say to people who feel that too many of their taxpayer dollars go toward prosecuting immigration-related issues that local counties are not being refunded for?
MR. FILIP: Generally speaking, funding would not … federal funding would not otherwise be given to state or local authorities. So they are kind of, with all respect, comparing apples and oranges if someone were to say that. Obviously, there’s enormous pressing needs in every community – children’s education, health care issues, all sorts of things. I think there’s a … there’s a consensus, certainly by the people who are our bosses, the Congress and the President, that immigration is a priority and border security is a priority. So we’re trying to take those resources that are given to us and use them in the most prudent and responsible way possible.
QUESTION: The Justice Department has been asked to review the activities of Sheriff Joe Arpaio (inaudible). Do you plan to take action on that, and do you have an opinion on the legality of (inaudible)?
MR. FILIP: That reference has been directed towards our Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Division are the experts in that area of law. It would be irresponsible for me to comment on allegations that are under review. I’m confident that the professionals there will give it a thorough review and will make an assessment consistent with their expertise.
QUESTION: So am I right in hearing you say that it is being reviewed?
MR. FILIP: It has been referred … there has been a request, and it was referred to the Civil Rights Division. Those are the people who would look at it. The fact that this would occur, as in anything else in the United States of America, an allegation is not proof. People are presumed innocent, whether that’s in a civil or criminal context, and that’s certainly the case here. But, but, when we get an allegation of that sort, it’s a serious allegation and it will be investigated.
QUESTION: Mr. Filip, having been to the border yourself, what sorts of things would change – would you see changing – at the border to indicate that the new initiatives, the new resources, the new attorneys, that that whole thing is a success?
MR. FILIP: Really, that … those metrics, I think, would probably best be defined by law enforcement agents who spend their careers on the border. One would hope for less violence. One would hope for … you know … even something like the amount of drugs seized, at some level seizing a lot more drugs is a positive. If you seize more and more drugs every year maybe that means it’s not fixing things. So that’s an ambiguous sort of metric. You would hope certainly for less violence, and beyond that, I’d be speculating outside my expertise. I would think that the DEA, the Border Patrol folks and FBI could tell you where they think they are winning and where they think they are losing.
MR. FILIP: Thank you very much.
QUESTION: (inaudible) all 64 positions?
MR. FILIP: I got to catch a flight, I’m sorry. Thank you.

Department of Justice Launches New Law Enforcement Strategy to Combat Increasing Threat of International Organized Crime
WASHINGTON – Today Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey announced a new strategy in the fight against international organized crime that will address this growing threat to U.S. security and stability. The Law Enforcement Strategy to Combat International Organized Crime (the strategy) was developed following an October 2007 International Organized Crime Threat Assessment (IOC Threat Assessment) and will address the demand for a strategic, targeted and concerted U.S. response to combat the identified threats. This strategy builds on the broad foundation the Administration has developed in recent years to enhance information sharing, and to secure U.S. borders and financial systems from a variety of transnational threats.
Today's announcement by the Attorney General was made during a forum hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies with Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Alice S. Fisher, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Deputy Director John S. Pistole and Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Julie Myers.
International organized crime is defined as those self-perpetuating associations of individuals who operate internationally for the purpose of obtaining power, influence, monetary and commercial gains, wholly or in part by illegal means, while protecting their activities through a pattern of corruption and violence. International organized criminals operate in hierarchies, clans, networks and cells. The crimes they commit vary as widely as the organizational structures they employ.
The strategy establishes an investigation and prosecution framework as committed and connected as the international organized crime structure it must combat. U.S. federal law enforcement agencies, in an unprecedented cooperative effort on this issue, will share international organized crime information and intelligence, collectively identify and prioritize the most significant threats and then put the full force of U.S. law enforcement’s expertise and resources toward mitigating those threats. In addition, U.S. law enforcement will increase cooperation with international partners to bring international criminals to justice, in the United States and abroad.
The strategy specifically reacts to the globalization of legal and illegal business, advances in technology, particularly the Internet, and the evolution of symbiotic relationships between criminals, public officials and business leaders that have combined to create a new, less restrictive environment within which international organized criminals can operate. Without the necessity of a physical presence, U.S. law enforcement must combat international organized criminals that target the relative wealth of the people and institutions in the United States while remaining outside the country.
“As international organized criminals have adapted their tactics over time and embraced emerging technology, we too must adapt,” said Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey. “With this strategy, we're building a new, 21st century program that we believe will be nimble enough to fight the threat of international organized crime for years to come.”
“International organized criminals have broadened the scope and depth of their illegal activities, reaching into a variety of sectors to sustain their inherent quest for money and power. These modern-day criminals threaten our physical, economic and national security, indeed, in many circumstances without even setting foot inside U.S. borders,” said Assistant Attorney Alice S. Fisher. “With this strategy, international organized criminals will be targeted and prosecuted in the same determined and concerted manner in which they pursue their illegal activities.”
Laid out in the strategy is a comprehensive and detailed plan that will enable the Department and nine federal law enforcement agencies to gather their collective resources to most effectively combat the threat of international organized crime. Ultimately, the strategy aims to create consensus among domestic law enforcement in identifying the most significant priority targets and then unified and concerted action among domestic and international law enforcement in significantly disrupting and dismantling those targets. This unprecedented coordination will include utilizing all available U.S. Government programs and capabilities, including existing economic, consular and other non-law enforcement means.
In addition, as a response to international organized criminals’ ability to operate unconstrained by national borders and geographic law enforcement jurisdictions, the strategy aims to ensure criminal laws and operating procedures reflect the modern realities and needs of international crime fighting. Similarly vital is the need to work in collaboration with public and private institutions that also face victimization by international organized criminals and therefore have been forced to act to minimize the impact on their businesses.
Prior to the strategy’s development, the Department of Justice and law enforcement partners conducted a comprehensive assessment of international organized crime. The IOC Threat Assessment lays out the threat international organized crime poses to U.S. national security, the stability of the U.S. economy and the integrity of government institutions, infrastructure and systems in the United States. The assessment is based on the best available information known to the U.S. Government through the combined efforts of the law enforcement, intelligence and interagency communities.
Specifically, the IOC Threat Assessment identifies and defines eight strategic threats:
- International organized criminals have penetrated the energy market and other strategic sectors of the U.S. and world economy. As U.S. energy needs continue to grow, so too could the power of those who control energy resources.
- International organized criminals provide logistical and other support to terrorists, foreign intelligence services and foreign governments, all with interests acutely adverse to those of U.S. national security.
- International organized criminals traffic in people and contraband goods, bringing people and products through U.S. borders to the detriment of border security, the U.S. economy, and the health and lives of those human beings exploited by human trafficking.
- International organized criminals exploit the U.S. and international financial system to move illegal profits and funds, including sending billions in illicit funds through the U.S. financial system annually. To continue this practice, they seek to corrupt financial service providers globally.
- International organized criminals use cyberspace to target U.S. victims and infrastructure, jeopardizing the security of personal information, the stability of business and government infrastructures and the security and solvency of financial investment markets.
- International organized criminals are manipulating securities exchanges and engaging in sophisticated fraud schemes that rob U.S. investors, consumers and government agencies of billions of dollars.
- International organized criminals have successfully corrupted public officials around the world, including countries of vital strategic importance to the United States and continue to seek ways to influence – legally or illegally – U.S. officials.
- International organized criminals use violence and the threat of violence as a basis of power.
“The activities of transnational and national organized criminal enterprises are increasing in scope and magnitude as these groups continue to strengthen their networking with each other to expand their operations,” said FBI Deputy Director John S. Pistole. “By increasing international cooperation and information sharing, together we can disrupt and dismantle these global, sophisticated organizations that have exploited geopolitical, economic, social, and technological changes over the last two decades to become increasingly active worldwide.”
“Partnerships among law enforcement agencies are our most effective weapon in combating international criminal networks,” said Julie L. Myers, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  “These criminal organizations pursue profit, without regard for national boundaries, international laws or human life.”
On April 7, 2008, the Organized Crime Council, chaired by Deputy Attorney General Mark R. Filip, recommended and the Attorney General signed The Law Enforcement Strategy to Combat International Organized Crime. The Attorney General has been in charge of coordinating all federal law enforcement activity against organized crime since a 1968 executive order by President Lyndon Johnson established that authority.
Similarly, the Organized Crime Council has existed in various forms since 1970 and has always been charged with establishing priorities and formulating a national unified strategy to combat organized crime. This is the first time the Organized Crime Council has ever convened to focus on the threat from international organized crime and to develop a responsive strategy to that threat. The Organized Crime Council consists of the Deputy Attorney General, the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, the Chair of the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee and the leaders of nine participating federal law enforcement agencies, which include: Federal Bureau of Investigation; U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Secret Service; Internal Revenue Service; U.S. Postal Inspection Service; Diplomatic Security; and U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of the Inspector General.

Improving Border Security And Immigration
The Administration Continues Its Efforts To Strengthen Border Security, Improve Interior And Worksite Enforcement, Streamline Existing Guest Worker Programs, And Help New Americans Assimilate
Tonight, President Bush will review the steps his Administration is taking to improve our border security and address immigration challenges.  America's broken immigration system is a major problem that the American people expect their elected leaders to solve.  Although Congress has not passed legislation to address the immigration challenges our Nation faces, the Administration continues to build upon progress we have already made in strengthening border security, enforcing our worksite laws, keeping our economy well-supplied with vital workers, and helping new Americans assimilate into our society. Yet the President will also urge that in order to take the pressure off the border, we need a new way for foreign workers to come here lawfully, on a temporary basis, and support our economy.
The Administration Is Strengthening Border Security With Additional Personnel, Technology And Infrastructure
The Administration has increased funding for border security and immigration enforcement by 159 percent, including emergency funds, since the President took office - from $4.8 billion in 2001 to $12.3 billion in 2008.
The Administration has expanded the Border Patrol from approximately 9,000 agents in 2001 to more than 15,000 agents today. By the end of 2008, we will have more than 18,000 agents, doubling the size of the Border Patrol under the President's leadership.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is on track to complete 370 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border by the end of calendar year 2008.  As of this month, we have completed a total of 165 miles of pedestrian fence along the southwest border, giving us a total of 290 miles of pedestrian and vehicle fence already in place at the border.  We expect to have 670 total miles of pedestrian and vehicle fence by the end of 2008, and have begun obtaining land to make this a reality.
The Administration is including a new Southwest Border Enforcement Initiative in its 2009 Budget.  This comprehensive Justice Department initiative will provide $100 million to help address the rise in crime and immigration cases on the southwest border.  It will increase our ability to arrest, detain, prosecute, and house violent criminals, drug offenders, and immigration violators along the southwest border. 
DHS is operating three Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) along the southern border in support of border security operations.  An additional UAS is scheduled to be operational this year. 
DHS saw a reduction of 20 percent in apprehensions of illegal aliens at the Southern border in Fiscal Year 2007.  This is an indication that stronger border security and enforcement efforts have deterred aliens from attempting to cross the border illegally.
The Administration has effectively ended the policy of ""catch and release"" and now detains all removable aliens caught trying to cross the border until they can be removed.  For years, limited detention space forced the release of many illegal border crossers from nations other than Mexico with nothing more than a Notice to Appear for a hearing before an immigration judge. Many aliens ignored these notices and instead blended into U.S. society.  The Administration has effectively ended this policy of ""catch and release"" and replaced it with a policy of ""catch and return,"" ensuring that all removable aliens caught trying to cross the border illegally are held until they can be removed. 
The Administration will end the decades old practice of allowing U.S. and Canadian citizens to enter the country at our land and sea ports of entry with merely an oral declaration of identity and citizenship.  Beginning January 31, 2008, all cross-border travelers must present documents establishing their identity and citizenship.  This is a precursor to the Congressionally mandated full implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative in June of 2009, at which time passports or similarly secure documents will be required by all travelers. 
The Administration Is Continuing To Enhance Interior And Worksite Enforcement
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has replaced the old approach of administrative hearings and fines for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens with a much tougher combination of criminal prosecutions and asset forfeitures. 
Arrests for criminal violations brought in worksite enforcement actions have increased from 19 in FY 2001 to 863 in FY 2007 - a more than 45-fold increase.  ICE also made 4,077 administrative arrests in FY 2007, for a total of 4,940 arrests.


In FY 2007, DHS obtained more than $31 million in criminal fines, restitutions and civil judgments as a result of worksite enforcement.

E-Verify is helping more than 48,000 companies verify the employment eligibility of newly hired employees. The number of companies enrolled in E-Verify has more than quadrupled in 16 months, now representing almost 200,000 business locations.  Currently, 2,000 employers are being added each week.  More than 3.7 million new hires were processed through E-Verify last year alone.  As more States like Arizona require local businesses to use E-Verify, and the Federal government begins to require Federal contractors to enroll in the program, it will become increasingly difficult for those here illegally to find work, greatly weakening the magnet that draws so many people to enter the country illegally.  In addition, E-Verify is a valuable tool in detecting immigration fraud and identity theft. 
DHS has issued a ""No-Match"" Employment Eligibility Verification regulation to help employers ensure their workers are legal and help the Government identify and crack down on employers who knowingly hire illegal workers.  Unfortunately, this useful regulation is being held up by litigation.  We expect a revised rule to be finalized and in effect this year.
In FY 2007, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE returned or removed almost 1.2 million illegal aliens from the United States. 
ICE has increased its enforcement efforts:
Since 2005, ICE has quintupled the number of teams devoted to removing fugitive aliens from the U.S. — from 15 Fugitive Operations Teams in 2005 to 75 of these seven-member teams by the end of FY 2007.


ICE has helped keep our communities safe by arresting 3,302 gang members and their associates in FY 2007. 


ICE has expanded its Criminal Alien Program to identify incarcerated criminal aliens.  In FY 2007, ICE identified for removal 164,296 criminals who were incarcerated in Federal, state and local facilities.
The Administration is training hundreds of State and local law enforcement officers to address illegal immigration in their communities.  The Administration is maintaining the 287(g) program, which allows State and local officers to enforce immigration law, and expanding other measures that help State and local law enforcement officials.  These measures include a broad array of enforcement tools, such as formal task forces, greater use of the ICE Law Enforcement Support Center, and enhanced partnerships to address location-specific threats, such as gangs.  The Administration is proposing an increase in funding for this program in its 2009 Budget.
The Administration Is Streamlining Existing Guest-Worker Programs To Help Keep Our Economy Well-Supplied With Vital Workers
The Department of Labor (DOL) and DHS are prepared to unveil a rule that would modernize the H-2A agricultural seasonal worker program to better provide farmers with an orderly and timely flow of legal workers, while protecting the rights of laborers.  No sector of the American economy requires a legal flow of foreign workers more than agriculture, which is experiencing labor shortages.
DOL is also working on regulations streamlining the H-2B Program for non-agricultural seasonal workers. 
DHS and DOL are studying potential administrative reforms to visa programs for highly skilled workers.
The Administration Is Taking Steps To Help New Americans Assimilate In Order To Keep Our Nation United
In September 2007, the DHS Office of Citizenship announced a revised naturalization test emphasizing the fundamental concepts of American democracy, basic U.S. history, and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  This test is ensuring fairness by eliminating the wide variations in testing quality between regional offices that plagued the former system.
The Office of Citizenship is also providing additional training for volunteers and adult educators who lead immigrants through the naturalization process. 
The Education Department is working on a free, Web-based portal to help immigrants learn English.  Knowledge of English is the most important component of assimilation.

History
The Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station (formerly Naco Border Patrol Station) is one of eight Border Patrol Stations within the Tucson Border Patrol Sector, located in Tucson Sector's East Corridor. It is named after U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry, who was killed on December 15, 2010.
Since the times of the American/Indian Wars (specifically with the Chiricahua Apaches) and the 10th Cavalry's Buffalo Soldiers, the areas of Naco and Cochise County Arizona has been known as an active zone in the protection of the United States Borders. The Buffalo Soldiers would deploy and patrol the areas of Naco and Cochise County, Arizona from their main garrison and headquarters in Fort Huachuca, Arizona from 1877 to 1886. The area was also patrolled and protected by units of the United States Army under the command of Brigadier General John J. Pershing during the period of 1915 to 1917 in their attempts to defend the United States against the incursions of Pancho Villa and his rebel army.
The Naco, Arizona area has always had a Border Patrol presence, since before 1924, when the patrol was known as the Mounted Inspectors. The many ranches and farms of the area provided a draw to illegal aliens looking for work, and farm and ranch check was performed by agents as they went about their duties. In the 1930's and 40's, Nogales agents would arrive periodically in Naco to perform operations, and the aliens apprehended would be put on trains and returned to Nogales, Sonora after being processed at the Naco Port of Entry.
This arrangement continued sporadically until Douglas Agents began to work the area as part of their territory. Naco did not have a permanent U.S. Border Patrol presence until 1982, when Douglas Agents began to work this area from a sub-station at the port of entry in Naco. It patrolled the International Boundary west of Paul Spur to the Huachuca Mountains and the territories north up to I-10.
As of early February 1989, the Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station has operated as an independent station within the Tucson Border Patrol Sector. Agents are assigned to patrol and enforcement duties. The Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station and its agents recorded the most apprehensions in the Nation for three consecutive years from 2001 to 2003. As of May, 2007, it was still considered one the busiest stations in terms of apprehensions within the United States Border Patrol.
Area of Responsibility
The Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station's area of responsibility (AOR) is located within the Cochise County in south east Arizona covering approximately 1,175 square miles. This includes 32.5 miles of International Boundary with the areas of Agua Prieta, Sonora, Mexico, Naco, Sonora, Mexico, and Cananea, Sonora, Mexico.
Sections of the Dragoon Mountain ranges, Mule Mountain ranges, Huachuca Mountain Ranges, and the Whetstone Mountain ranges are included in the Station's AOR and includes a large part of the Coronado National Forest and its canyons. The San Pedro River starts in Mexico, flowing north into the United States through the Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station's AOR near Palominas, Arizona.

History
Niagara Falls Station is one of the oldest Border Patrol Stations in the United States. The current Station area of responsibility covers 73.2 miles in the Niagara Falls area.
In 1920 the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was enacted and the ensuing Prohibition Era helped to clarify the need for a more organized U.S. Border Patrol (U.S.B.P.). The Labor Appropriation Act of 1924 officially established the U.S.B.P. for the purpose of patrolling between designated inspection stations. Smuggling of alcohol and moonshine was rampant along the entire U.S. Canada border during the early years of the Border Patrol's existence. Armed confrontations between Patrol Inspectors and smugglers were commonplace throughout the 1920's and early 1930's on the northern border. Niagara Falls was not immune to the violence. On March 24, 1932, Patrol Inspectors (P.I.) Frank Vidmar Jr. and James W. Hudson encountered a vehicle laden with illegal alcohol. After the smuggler refused commands to stop, a lengthy high speed chase ensued. P.I. Vidmar was killed and P.I. Hudson seriously injured when their vehicle skidded on icy pavement and crashed into an oncoming trolley car in Niagara Falls, NY, during that chase.
Throughout World War II Niagara Falls Agents continued their regular patrol duties while assisting whenever necessary in the war effort. Patrolmen remained on high alert throughout the war years for potential Axis saboteurs attempting entry from Canada. Local Patrolmen were also constantly aware of the existence of a prisoner of War camp for German Afrika Corps prisoners which was located at Fort Niagara, Youngstown, NY (near Niagara Falls).
During the ensuing decades the Niagara Falls Station continued to patrol its area of responsibility utilizing a variety of marine and air assets, and by good old fashioned foot (and snowshoe) patrol in the rugged Niagara Gorge. Agents readily adapted to complex changes to our nation's immigration laws and to various national crises during the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's and 1980's. These included; airlifts (of illegal aliens) to Mexico in the 1950's, domestic air marshal duties in the 1960's, and the Mariel Boat Lift in 1980. Agents maintained a high level of professionalism throughout those years.
With increased manpower following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks Agents have discovered a wide variety smuggling attempts. These included; drug mules arrested trying to gain entry by crawling along the treacherous framework underneath the Whirlpool Bridge, smuggled alien loads which crossed the Niagara River on small inflatable rafts, alien and narcotics loads in larger boats, and a multitude of alien arrests following other agency calls.

The board of commissioners has eight members, four appointed by the Ontario Premier and four by the Governor of the State of New York. They are headquartered in Lewiston, New York.
Area of Responsibility
The Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station area of responsibility (AOR) encompasses a wide range of geographic features that require unique operational tactics and a unique knowledge set amongst its agents. The AOR consists of 73.2 miles of international boundary and over 523 square miles of terrain ranging from the major tourist destination of Niagara Falls, where agents encounter citizens from across the globe; along the Niagara River, where agents maintain vigilant watch for illegal incursions on a treacherous stretch of waterway; to the shoreline of Lake Ontario, which is a mere 40 miles from the major Canadian population center of Toronto. The location and geographic features found in the Niagara Falls Station AOR pose operational challenges to accomplishing the National Border Patrol's Strategy of maintaining operational control of the border of the United States.

For Immediate Release
Office of the Press Secretary
August 10, 2007
Fact Sheet: Improving Border Security and Immigration Within Existing Law

  White House News
  En Español
      In Focus: Immigration
Today, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff And Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez Announced A Series Of Reforms The Administration Will Pursue To Address Border Security And Immigration Challenges.  The following reforms represent steps the Administration can take within the boundaries of existing law to secure our borders more effectively, improve interior and worksite enforcement, streamline existing guest worker programs, improve the current immigration system, and help new immigrants assimilate into American culture.
BORDER SECURITY
1.       The Administration Will Continue To Strengthen Security At The Border With Additional Personnel And Infrastructure.  We are committed to implementing the following border security measures by December 31, 2008:
18,300 Border Patrol agents
370 miles of fencing
300 miles of vehicle barriers
105 camera and radar towers
Three additional UAVs
We will also work to ensure that 1,700 more Border Patrol Agents and an additional UAV are added in 2009.
2.       The Administration Will Maintain The Policy Of ""Catch And Return"" For Illegal Aliens Apprehended At The Border.  For years, limited detention space forced the release of many illegal border crossers from nations other than Mexico with nothing more than a Notice to Appear for a hearing before an immigration judge. Many aliens ignored these notices and instead blended into U.S. society.  The Administration has ended this practice and instituted a policy of ""catch and return,"" ensuring that all removable aliens caught trying to cross the border illegally are held until they can be removed. 

The Administration Will Further Increase Funding For Detention Beds So There Are Places To Detain 31,500 Illegal Aliens Until They Can Be Returned.

The Administration Will Also Press Recalcitrant Countries To Work With The United States To Repatriate Citizens Who Are In The United States Illegally.
3.       The Departments Of State And Homeland Security Will Strengthen Legal Efforts To Keep International Gang Members Out Of The United States.  Gangs are at the root of many U.S. crime problems today, and many of the most dangerous gangs draw significant membership from abroad.  The Federal government already denies visas to known members of certain gangs from China, the former Soviet Union, and El Salvador.  Today, the President is directing the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand this list of dangerous organized gangs from other nations and to ensure that members of those gangs are barred from entry into the United States. 
4.       The Administration Will Expand Exit Requirements So Persons Who Overstay Limited-Duration Visits To The United States Can Be Identified.   

By The End Of 2008, The US-VISIT Exit Requirement Will Be Underway At All U.S. Airports And Seaports.  The Department of Homeland Security will continue to explore effective and cost-efficient means of establishing biometric exit requirements at land border crossings.

The Administration Will Establish A New Land-Border Exit System For Guest Workers, Starting On A Pilot Basis.  This will help ensure that temporary workers in the country now follow the mandate to leave when their work authorization expires.
5.       The Administration Will Require All Travelers To Our Ports Of Entry To Use Passports Or Other Similar Secure Documents.  Since January 2007, air travelers have been required to carry a passport for entry into the United States.  Because of passport processing backlogs, a temporary accommodation has been made for U.S. citizens traveling in the Western Hemisphere, which will be phased out.  Starting January 31, 2008, DHS will phase in a requirement for passports or other secure documents for sea and land ports of entry.
6.       Beginning This Fall, The Secretary Of Homeland Security Will Deliver Regular ""State Of The Border"" Reports. These reports will keep the American people informed of the Federal Government's progress in securing the border and hold the Administration accountable for continuing improvement.
INTERIOR ENFORCEMENT
7.       The Administration Is Training Hundreds Of State And Local Law Enforcement Officers To Address Illegal Immigration In Their Communities.  The Administration is maintaining the 287(g) program and expanding other measures that help State and local law officials.  These measures include a broad array of enforcement tools, such as formal task forces, greater use of the ICE Law Enforcement Support Center, delegated border search and seizure authority under Title 19, and enhanced partnerships to address location-specific threats, such as gangs.
8.       By This Fall, U.S. Immigration And Customs Enforcement Teams Devoted To Removing Fugitive Aliens Will Have Been Quintupled In Less Than Three Years.  There were 15 seven-member Fugitive Operations Teams in 2005. As of this week there are 68; there will be 75 by the end of September.
9.       The Justice Department Will Initiate Regulatory Action To Close The ""Voluntary Departure"" Loophole Manipulated By Many Illegal Immigrants.  Illegal immigrants who settle their cases by agreeing to voluntarily depart sometimes then gain extra time inside the United States by filing a procedural motion to reopen the case. New regulations will clarify that filing such a motion will terminate the voluntary departure status and make the alien subject to the order of removal.  They will also set a presumptive $3,000 civil penalty for failing to comply with a voluntary departure agreement.
WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT
10.   Today, The Department Of Homeland Security Issued A ""No-Match"" Regulation That Will Help Employers Ensure Their Workers Are Legal And Help The Government Identify And Crack Down On Employers Who Knowingly Hire Illegal Workers.  In cases in which an employer has a significant number of employees with inaccurate personal identity information, the Social Security Administration will send the employer a ""No-Match"" letter.  The regulation clarifies that employers may be held liable if they ignore the ""No Match"" problems by failing to take specified steps within 90 days of receiving the letter.
11.   In The Coming Months, The Administration Will Publish A Regulation That Will Reduce The Number Of Documents That Employers Must Accept To Confirm The Identity And Work Eligibility Of Their Employees.  Presently, no fewer than 29 categories of documents can be used to establish identity and work eligibility.  Employers have little capacity to verify the authenticity of these documents, and the sheer quantity of accepted documents is an invitation to fraud.  This regulation will reduce unlawful employment by weeding out insecure documents now used often for identity fraud.     
12.   As A Civil Counterpart To The Administration's Strategy Of Using Criminal Investigations To Deter Illegal Employment, The Department Of Homeland Security Will Raise The Civil Fines Imposed On Employers Who Knowingly Hire Illegal Immigrants By Approximately 25 Percent.  Efforts to secure the border will fail unless the ""magnet"" that attracts illegals is turned off.  Unfortunately, the fines for relying on illegal workers are so modest that some companies treat them as little more than a cost of doing business.  DHS will use existing authority to update civil fines for inflation in order to boost fines by about 25 percent, as much as is allowed under current law.
13.   The Administration Will Continue To Expand Criminal Investigations Against Employers Who Knowingly Hire Large Numbers Of Illegal Aliens.  Arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for criminal violations have increased from 24 in FY 1999 to a record 716 in FY 2006.  There have been 742 criminal arrests since the beginning of FY 2007 (through July 31), and there is anecdotal evidence that companies are taking notice and adjusting their business practices to follow the law.
14.   The Administration Will Commence a Rulemaking Process To Require All Federal Contractors And Vendors To Use E-Verify, The Federal Electronic Employment Verification System, To Ensure That Their Employees Are Authorized To Work In The United States.  The Federal government ought to lead by example.  As there are more than 200,000 companies doing Federal business, this will significantly expand use of E-Verify, and make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to obtain jobs through fraud.
15.   The Administration Will Help States Make Greater Use Of E-Verify.  Some States already mandate the use of E-Verify by some or all of their hiring agencies, and other States are considering similar requirements.  The Administration will assist such efforts through outreach and offers of technical assistance.
16.   The Administration Will Bolster E-Verify By Expanding The Data Sources It Can Check.  This will make it easier to catch individuals who commit identity theft.  New sources of data will include cross-checks of visa and passport information.
17.   The Administration Will Seek Voluntary State Partners Willing To Share Their Department Of Motor Vehicles Photos And Records With E-Verify.  Agreements to allow E-Verify access to the repository of photographs in state DMV databases will help prevent illegal immigrants from using fraudulent driver’s licenses to obtain employment.  Such agreements will also lay the groundwork for further expansion of the electronic employment eligibility verification system.
STREAMLINING EXISTING GUEST-WORKER PROGRAMS
18.   The Department Of Labor (DOL) Will Reform The H-2A Agricultural Seasonal Worker Program.  No sector of the American economy requires a legal flow of foreign workers more than agriculture, which has begun to experience severe labor shortages as our Southern border has tightened.  The President has therefore directed DOL to review the regulations implementing the H-2A program and to institute changes that will provide farmers with an orderly and timely flow of legal workers, while protecting the rights of laborers.
19.   The Department Of Labor Will Issue Regulations Streamlining The H-2B Program For Non-Agricultural Seasonal Workers.  Because businesses in seasonal industries such as landscaping and hospitality frequently have a difficult time locating temporary workers, the H-2B program has proven quite popular.  Some employers report significant processing delays, however.  DOL's proposed rule will speed processing by moving from a government-certified system to an employer-attestation system akin to the PERM system that has reduced backlogs in other areas. 
20.   The Department Of Homeland Security Will Extend The Visa Term For Professional Workers From Canada And Mexico To Attract More Of These Talented Workers To The United States.  The United States must compete for foreign professional workers, and those who elect to lend their talents to the U.S. economy should be welcomed with open arms, not given a bureaucratic runaround. Yet the roughly 65,000 workers who enter the United States each year on the TN visa must go to the trouble of renewing their visa every year. This regulation will extend the TN visa duration to three years – the same term as other popular professional visas.
21.   The Department Of Homeland Security And The Department Of Labor Will Study And Report On Potential Administrative Reforms To Visa Programs For Highly Skilled Workers.
IMPROVING EXISTING IMMIGRATION
22.   The Administration Will Reform And Expedite Background Checks For Immigration.  Current mechanisms for conducting immigration background checks are backed up, slowing processing times and endangering national security. The Administration is investing substantial new funds to address the backlog, and the FBI and USCIS are working together on a variety of projects designed to streamline existing processes so as to reduce waiting times without sacrificing security.
23.   The President Is Directing The Department Of Homeland Security And The Social Security Administration To Study The Technical And Recordkeeping Reforms Necessary To Guarantee That Illegal Aliens Do Not Earn Credit In Our Social Security System For Illegal Work.   Currently, aliens who make Social Security payments while working here legally can continue to accrue credits even if they overstay their visa.  Improved data-sharing can lay the foundation for eventual Congressional action to eliminate this practice (which proved an obstacle to comprehensive reform).  The relevant agencies are ordered to report to the President with a detailed plan for eliminating the problem.
ASSIMILATION
24.   The Office Of Citizenship Will Announce A Revised Naturalization Test In September 2007.  The new test will emphasize fundamental concepts of American democracy, basic U.S. history, and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  It will inculcate the basic values we share as Americans, and encourage civic knowledge and patriotism among prospective citizens. 

The New Standardized Test Will Ensure Fairness By Eliminating Current Wide Variations In The Quality Of Testing Between Regional Offices.
25.   The Office Of Citizenship Will Provide Additional Training For Volunteers And Adult Educators Who Lead Immigrants Through The Naturalization Process.  In October 2007, the Office of Citizenship will introduce a web-based training program that covers U.S. government, civics education, and the naturalization process.  To complement these on-line materials, USCIS will convene eight regional training conferences, beginning in October 2007, to improve the ability of citizenship instructors and volunteers to teach American history, civics, and the naturalization process to immigrant students.  An on-line training module will also be available by the end of the year.
26.   The Department Of Education Will Launch A Free, Web-Based Portal To Help Immigrants Learn English, And Expand This Model Over Time.  Knowledge of English is the most important component of assimilation.  An investment in tools to help new Americans learn English will be repaid many times over in the contributions these immigrants make to our political discourse, economy, and society.

Remarks at the Monterrey Conference Dinner
Monterrey, Mexico
October 28, 2007
As prepared for delivery
Good evening. Thank you, Chairman Alemán, for that kind introduction. I’d like to recognize President Berger of Guatemala and Governor Gonzalez Parás of Nuevo Leon for being here with us tonight. Thank you to all of the distinguished guests here tonight for allowing me to be part of this important dialogue. The Monterrey Conference every year has distinguished all of the leaders who come together to look at our long-term relationship and outlook for the Hemisphere.
I’m glad to be back in Mexico tonight. As many of you know, I served as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico for four years, from 1989 through 1993. I often think of my years in Mexico as among the most interesting and fruitful ones in my career. My family treasures our memories of times spent here and the many Mexican friends we made; and we have returned frequently since leaving our official position in Mexico City in September of 1993.
The United States has a great stake in the success of Mexico. We share a deep, broad relationship and we understand that our futures -- our success and competitiveness in this global era -- are increasingly intertwined. We have unique demographic links; we know our society is enriched by the talent and productivity of many of your countrymen who live in the United States. Today, a million Americans live in Mexico. Ours is a friendship and a partnership that has grown, in time, based on shared values and shared interests and extensive people-to-people relationships.
When I remember my service in Mexico, I think of how far our relationship has come since 1993. When I became Ambassador, the popular consensus was that strong bilateral ties were beyond reach. I remember preparing to assume the Ambassadorship and reading Alan Riding’s “Distant Neighbors.” The author referred to Mexico and the U.S. as two border nations “separated by language, religion, race, philosophy, and history.” He continued, “Probably no where in the world do two neighbors understand each other so little.” Riding wrote his book in 1984. It was a pessimistic message.
What a difference two decades can make. Look at the breadth of our achievement – because it reflects how far we have come. The number of issues we discuss, the interaction across a range of bilateral, trilateral and multilateral issues – not to mention the state and local dynamic – is larger than ever before. Today our countries are joined – not divided – by history, culture, business and connections our citizens understood long before governments caught up.
We are no longer distant neighbors – we are profoundly engaged with each other. Does that mean we will always agree? Of course not. But it does mean that, more often than not, our common values are leading us to cooperate on common challenges. Mexicans and Americans alike increasingly recognize the corrosive impact of narcotics trafficking and crime on both sides of the border. And our common values include a commitment to democracy, rule of law, and prosperity for all of our citizens.
As Ambassador of the United States to Mexico 14 years ago, I served during a dynamic time for U.S.-Mexico relations. I participated in negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA transformed relations between the United States and Mexico and served as a model for economic growth and development across the world.
At the end of my tenure as ambassador in 1993, the U.S. and Mexico were on the verge of implementing NAFTA. In that year, trade between the U.S. and Mexico amounted to $99 billion. U.S. investment in Mexico stood at $15.4 billion. Neither of these sums are pocket change, but now, fourteen years later, they are dwarfed by numbers that reflect the huge strides we have made in integrating our economies. In 2005, U.S. investment in Mexico was $71.4 billion -- more than quadruple the 1993 amount. In 2006 we traded more than a billion dollars worth of goods and services a day, almost quadrupling our bilateral commerce as well.
In the first 15 years of this historic free trade agreement we have together greatly advanced the competitiveness of North America. By opening new markets, NAFTA has led to the creation of new jobs and increases for standards of living. It will continue to do so. Yet as we work to realize the promise of free trade, we are mindful of those on both sides of the border who do not feel the benefits of such trade and question its utility. We must continue to invest in education, job training, and development programs so that every citizen has the skills to compete in the dynamic 21st century and we make North America the best place to live and do business in the world.
You and I are both better off as a result of NAFTA. With continued close North American cooperation, I am confident our children will reap even greater benefits.
And as I said, NAFTA has been a model for the region as we negotiate additional free trade agreements in the Hemisphere. Just this month, Costa Rica voted in favor of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA, which will encourage broad trade through Central America and the Dominican Republic. And President Bush has asked the U.S. Congress to vote in favor of three additional free trade agreements – Colombia, Panama, and Peru. These agreements make our economies stronger, generate employment, and promote competitiveness we all need in this vast new global economy. It is vital that these accords be approved by our Congress as soon as possible.
Fourteen years ago our leaders had a vision of a dynamic region prospering economically and politically. Today our leaders recognize the need to protect our prosperity and well-being by combating transnational threats. We are united in our goal of a prosperous and secure region, free from exploitation by organized criminals, and safe from the risk of terrorism.
Our economies prosper best if investors feel secure, consumers can make decisions without intimidation, and business can be confident in the rule of law. Criminal organizations and terrorists not only destroy lives and possessions -- they destroy confidence and hope.
This groundwork for increased cooperation was laid during the Fox Administration, when we began to improve information sharing across borders to better attack transnational criminal organizations. The more we communicated and cooperated however, the more we realized the enormity of the challenge.
Today, it is my privilege to again play a role in strengthening U.S.-Mexico ties as we join together as partners confronting our mutual threats. We assume our mutual obligations to protect ourselves against criminal organizations operating not just along our border, but deep within our two nations with a high level of violence and callous disregard for human life that our citizens reject.
When President Calderon came into office, he made clear that the fight against organized crime was a priority. To date his actions have spoken even more loudly and underscore his determination and dedication to success in this fight. Since January, the Government of Mexico has extradited more than 70 criminals, including major figures from each of the key cartels operating in Mexico. It has launched a series of surges in key states to disrupt criminal operations and networks. Not only are federal law enforcement entities making anti-corruption efforts a priority, but the central government has reached out to state and local entities to do the same. And we have seen record seizures of precursor chemicals; cocaine, with 10 tons seized just weeks ago; and cash, with $207 million recently seized from in a house in Mexico City.
President Calderon is relentless in the fight. He has proposed bold security and judicial reforms pending before the Mexican congress now. These reforms may soon be added to the list of reforms successfully passed by a newly invigorated congressional leadership. I want to acknowledge the sacrifice of his leadership. As cartels lash back against the government, more soldiers, police, and public servants have been killed this year than ever before.
President Calderon and his team recognize that this is a shared challenge. And the United States has also been active in these same efforts. We have established a National Southwest Border Counter narcotics Strategy to implement objectives in intelligence collection, interdiction, surveillance and prosecution to stop criminal activities. And in 2005 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched its own Southwest Border Initiative to share trace information with Mexico, close off weapons trafficking corridors, and expand intelligence cooperation.
Successful initiatives on both sides of the border have led both our nations to a similar point: we are stronger working together. Organized crime does not respect borders, and we should not let borders be barriers to our separate law enforcement efforts. Cooperation across the border will strengthen our individual efforts as well, further undercutting the drug-traffickers and gangs.
During his meeting last March with President Bush, President Calderon proposed our two countries intensify our efforts bilaterally. He urged the United States to expand its efforts to reduce drug demand, stem the flow of arms across the border, and attack money-laundering more aggressively. President Calderon also offered to expand bilateral cooperation so that we could both be more effective, on our respective sides of the border, to stop organized crime and drug trafficking, and ensure that terrorist organizations cannot ever exploit either nation.
Since that time we have been in extensive consultations to define the scope of our new partnership. We have heard the words of encouragement from our respective legislatures and look forward to engaging with them, recognizing the critical roles they have in this process. Both presidents have been closely engaged at key moments, discussing the development of the partnership by phone and of course at the recent North American Leaders Summit in Montebello, Canada last August.
The result is the Merida Initiative, a new partnership announced by President Bush and President Calderon last week to confront organized crime and drug trafficking organizations operating in the region. NAFTA transformed our trade and helped our people prosper. This new initiative will build on the success of NAFTA and define our shared responsibility to confront criminal organizations. We commit to the strategic and tactical cooperation necessary to combat criminal activity and separate initiatives to strengthen our respective, complementary, efforts against specific challenges.
Let me start by telling you what this partnership is not. It is not a plan that involves increases in U.S. government presence in Mexico with law enforcement or military. It is not a strategy that in any way infringes on Mexico's sovereign rights --- or on those of the United States. It is a strategy to succeed -- to succeed against organized criminals and drug traffickers, to succeed in protecting the victims they traffic and exploit, to succeed in reinforcing our mutual efforts against possible terrorist threats, and to succeed in breaking smuggling networks of every possible kind.
Our two countries will share information and databases to make sure we know as much as possible about the criminals and their networks. The United States will support Mexico's ongoing initiatives with equipment so that our respective law enforcement teams can work more effectively together. We will share leads, develop parallel investigations, and pursue respective prosecutions to take criminals off the streets of Mexico and the United States. We will offer to expand existing training programs so that Mexico's law enforcement officials have the resources and capabilities they need to enforce their law.
We will work on our own challenges as well. For the United States, demand reduction, bulk currency and illegal arms flows are a priority, in addition to our current efforts. For Mexico, directly attacking organized crime while reforming its police and judicial systems are formidable tasks.
Additionally, we will look south together, and expand our strategy and assistance to our willing partners in Central America who share both the same challenges and the same commitment to confront them. Working with the leaders of Mexico and these nations, we will align our training, offer equipment and information so that the long trail of illicit activity that traverses Central America towards the United States can be broken.
As we succeed -- as criminal organizations disband, as gangs lose their sway in Central America, as the U.S. reduces drug demand -- we will prosper. When criminals stop corrupting, intimidating, and undermining our societies, business can flourish, employment can multiply, and opportunity can take root.
I was privileged to be present at the creation of NAFTA, and to now see the good it has wrought for all three partners. I feel privileged to be present as the United States and Mexico launch a new era of cooperation against crime in all its forms, an era that will free us of the suffering organized crime now causes, and secure us from the always present threat of terrorism. Two decades ago we might have been merely neighbors with a common border -- today we are partners on many of the issues of mutual import to both our nations. From the great strengths of both our nations, and from the respect and trust we bring each other, this partnership will truly succeed.

This report provides an accounting of costs to border counties in the States of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas for the immigration population, specifically the undocumented immigration, which is the responsibility of the Federal Government and its failed immigration and border security policies.
Abstract
In fiscal year 2006, the law enforcement and criminal justice costs associated with undocumented immigration to these 24 border counties were $192 million. Over the past 8 fiscal years, from 1999 through 2006, the costs have added up to a staggering $1.23 billion. A fundamental principle of immigration law since 1790 is that the Federal Government has primary power and responsibility, related to several Constitutional provisions. However, the Federal Government has only reimbursed these 24 counties $4.7 million for detaining criminal undocumented immigrants for fiscal year 2006 (and $54.8 million since 1999). Many members of Congress have recognized that costs to counties associated with undocumented immigration are a Federal responsibility and reimbursement is the only appropriate action when costs are documented. This study supported by the U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice researched the law enforcement and criminal justice agencies in all 24 counties within the States of California (San Diego and Imperial), Arizona (Yuma, Pima, Santa Cruz, and Cochise), New Mexico (Hidalgo, Luna, and Dona Ana), and Texas (El Paso, Hudspeth, Culberson, Jeff Davis, Presidio, Brewster, Terrell, Val Verde, Maverick, Kinney, Webb, Zapata, Starr, Hidalgo, and Cameron); fiscal data were compiled for 1 fiscal year, 2006, on expenditures from the county general fund. This report is about the costs to county governments of providing services for populations that are the responsibility of the Federal Government. The costs of the Federal Government’s failed immigration policy disproportionately substantially affect these 24 counties along the United States-Mexico border. Tables

President Bush Backs Graham-Kyl Amendment for Mandatory Funding for Border Security Efforts
Wes Hickman (202-224-5972) or Kevin Bishop (864-250-1417)
WASHINGTON -- President Bush today came out strongly in support of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-South Carolina) proposed amendment to the Senate immigration bill requiring mandatory funding for border security and enforcement provisions contained in the legislation.
  “The moment the presidential signing pen meets the paper these funds will be available,” said Graham.  “I’m very pleased President Bush has embraced the Graham-Kyl Amendment requiring mandatory funding for border security and enforcement.”
  Today, in a speech to the Associated Builders and Contractors President Bush said, “We're going to show the American people that the promises in this bill will be kept” and that the legislation would also “show the American people that we’re going to do our jobs of securing this border once and for all.”  
  Graham’s proposed amendment, introduced with Senator Jon Kyl (R-Arizona), will immediately make available $4.4 billion in mandatory spending to secure our nation’s borders.  Funds will be spent on miles of new fencing, miles of new vehicle barriers, surveillance towers, detention beds, the Electronic Employee Verification System (EEVS), and other enforcement programs.  The penalties paid by z-visa holders as a condition of their punishment and probation would reimburse taxpayers for the border security improvements.
  “The funds will be ready to use in our efforts to construct miles of new fencing, miles of new vehicle barriers, utilize new cutting-edge technology at the border, build surveillance towers, institute an EEVS to ensure workers are legal, and other enforcement measures,” said Graham.
  “Congress has listened and heard the constructive criticism which has been offered,” said Graham.  “The Graham-Kyl Amendment addresses legitimate concerns on the part of the American people that Congress would not fund our border security efforts.  I believe we have now addressed those concerns and I expect Congress will pass this amendment when we return to immigration reform.”

Fact Sheet: Border Security and Immigration Reform Agreement Overcomes 1986 Mistakes
Bipartisan Proposal Requires Tough Border Security And Worksite Enforcement Measures

  White House News
      In Focus: Immigration
The Bipartisan Border Security And Immigration Reform Agreement Addresses And Overcomes Failures Of The 1986 Immigration Reform And Control Act. The 1986 Act failed because it gave a complete pardon (amnesty) to 3 million illegal immigrants as part of an automatic path to citizenship, did not provide the resources necessary to secure the borders adequately, relied on an employer verification system with only limited capability to detect ID fraud, provided inadequate penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, and made no provisions to meet future labor needs of U.S. employers in a growing economy.
In Contrast, The Bipartisan Border Security And Immigration Reform Agreement:
1. Does not offer amnesty to illegal immigrants already here; 2. Contains much tougher border security triggers that must be in place and operational before the Z visa and temporary worker programs take effect; 3. Requires that a sophisticated Employment Eligibility Verification System (EEVS) capable of rooting out fraud be ready to process all new hires before the Z visa and temporary worker programs take effect; 4. Substantially increases penalties on employers for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants; and 5. Creates a temporary worker program to relieve pressure on the border and provide a lawful way to meet our economic needs.
1. No Amnesty
Illegal Immigrants Already Here Must Acknowledge That They Broke The Law And Pay A Fine. In order to obtain a Z visa granting temporary legal status, workers in the country before January 1, 2007, must acknowledge that they broke the law, pay a $1,000 fine, pass criminal background checks, remain employed, and maintain a clean record.
Z Visa Workers Must Pay An Additional Fine, Learn English, And Meet Other Requirements To Apply For A Green Card, And Cannot Receive One Until Years In The Future. Z visa workers must apply at the back of the line and wait until the current backlog is cleared, pay an additional $4,000 fine, complete accelerated English requirements, maintain employment, leave the U.S. and file their application in their home country, and demonstrate merit based on the skills and attributes they will bring to the United States.

The 1986 Act Created An Automatic Path To Citizenship That Provided Green Cards After Just 18 Months, But Satisfying The Requirements In This Proposal Will Take Most Green Card Applicants More Than A Decade.
2. Strengthening Border Security
Tough Border Security Benchmarks Must Be Met Before The Z Visa And Temporary Worker Programs Go Into Effect. These triggers include constructing 370 miles of fencing and 200 miles of vehicle barriers at the border and finishing doubling the size of the Border Patrol since the President took office - a goal previously set by the President and already well on its way to achievement.
The Department Of Homeland Security Is On Track To Build 150 Miles Of Fence By The End Of September 2007 And To Build 370 Miles By The End Of Calendar Year 2008. Currently, about 86 miles of fence have been built along the border, with 64 additional miles planned by the end of September 2007.

We Have Expanded The Border Patrol From About 9,000 Agents In 2001 To More Than 13,000 Agents Today, And By The End Of 2008, We Will Have More Than 18,000 Agents On The Job.
With Enhanced Enforcement, We Have Already Seen A Tremendous Change At The Border. The number of people apprehended for illegally crossing our Southern border is down by nearly 27 percent in 2007 from this point in 2006.
The 1986 Act Provided Only About 4,000 Agents For The Border Patrol. By contrast, we will have more than four times that number of Border Patrol agents in place before the Z visa and temporary worker programs go into effect. In addition, improvements in infrastructure and technology at the border make border enforcement more achievable now than it was 20 years ago. For example, today, we have in place:
5,290 sensors on the southern border
687 night time cameras on the southern border
449 day time cameras on the southern border
1 Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) in Southern AZ
3. Putting A Workable Employer Verification System In Place
An Employment Eligibility Verification System (EEVS) Must Be Ready To Process New Hires Before The Z Visa And Temporary Worker Programs Go Into Effect. Employers will be required to verify the work eligibility of all employees using the EEVS, and all workers will be required to present stronger and more readily verifiable identification documents.
The EEVS Will Require Presentation Of A Limited Range Of Highly Secure Government IDs, Which Will Be Checked Electronically Against Federal And State Databases. When a worker presents an identification document to obtain employment, the EEVS will perform an electronic check against Federal and State databases. The Social Security Administration will be asked to confirm whether the name and Social Security number presented by the worker are a ""match"" in its files. Furthermore, the EEVS will use links to the U.S. State Department and individual State Departments of Motor Vehicles to provide employers with the digital photograph associated in government databases with the ID presented. Once employers have direct access to the original photograph associated with an ID, it will be much harder for illegal immigrants to fool them with fake documents.

The 1986 Act Relied On A Verification System That Did Not Have The Capacity To Detect ID Fraud. More than two dozen documents are acceptable under the 1986 system, and employers are not legally required to verify the documents' authenticity.
4. Increasing Penalties For Employers Who Knowingly Hire Illegal Immigrants
Employers Who Hire Illegal Workers Will Face Stiff New Criminal And Civil Penalties. The maximum civil fine for hiring illegal workers will rise from the 1986 level of $2,000 to $5,000 for first offenders and from the 1986 level of $10,000 to $25,000 for three-time offenders. The maximum criminal penalty for a pattern or practice of hiring illegal workers will increase 25-fold, from $3,000 per alien to $75,000 per alien.
5. Creating A Temporary Worker Program
By Creating A Lawful And Orderly Channel For Foreign Workers To Come To America On A Temporary Basis, The Temporary Worker Program (TWP) Will Help Reduce The Number Of People Trying To Sneak Across The Border. The TWP will help meet our economic needs by allowing workers to enter the country legally on a temporary basis to fill jobs that Americans are not doing.
TWP Workers Can Come To The U.S. Only On A Temporary Basis. To ensure that ""temporary"" means ""temporary,"" workers are limited to three two-year terms, with at least one year spent outside the United States between each term.

The TWP Will Allow U.S. Law Enforcement To Focus More Of Its Resources On Apprehending Violent Criminals And Terrorists Who Pose A Threat To Our Security

The 1986 Act Failed To Address Our Economy's Need For Immigrant Labor. Further illegal immigration was encouraged by this lack of a legal avenue to meet the labor needs of U.S. employers.

President Bush's Plan For Comprehensive Immigration Reform
      2007 State of the Union Policy Initiatives
      In Focus: Immigration
      Tonight, President Bush Will Call On Congress To Pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform.  The President believes that America can simultaneously be a lawful, economically dynamic, and welcoming society.  We must address the problem of illegal immigration and deliver a system that is secure, productive, orderly, and fair.  The President calls on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform that will secure our borders, enhance interior and worksite enforcement, create a temporary worker program, resolve – without animosity and without amnesty – the status of illegal immigrants already here, and promote assimilation into our society. All elements of this problem must be addressed together – or none of them will be solved.  
1. The United States Must Secure Its Borders
Border Security Is The Basic Responsibility Of A Sovereign Nation And An Urgent Requirement Of Our National Security.  We have more than doubled border security funding from $4.6 billion in FY 2001 to $10.4 billion in FY 2007.  We will have also increased the number of Border Patrol agents by 63 percent – from just over 9,000 agents at the beginning of this Administration to nearly 15,000 at the end of 2007.  We are also on track to increase this number to approximately 18,000 by the end of 2008, doubling the size of the Border Patrol during the President's time in office.
To Supplement The Border Patrol As Its Numbers Increase, Approximately 6,000 National Guard Members Have Been Sent To Our Southern Border In Coordination With Governors.  National Guard units are assisting the Border Patrol by operating surveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and vehicle barriers, and building patrol roads.  The National Guard is increasing the operational capacity of the Border Patrol to gain control of our Southern border.
The President's Secure Border Initiative (SBI) Is The Most Technologically Advanced Border Enforcement Initiative In American History.  Last year, we initiated a multi-year plan to secure our borders and reduce illegal immigration through comprehensive upgrading of technology used in controlling the border, including improved communications assets, expanded use of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, and state-of-the-art detection technology. 
The Administration Is Increasing Infrastructure Investment At The Border.   We are expanding detention capacity and developing rapidly deployable fencing technology that will be rolled out this year.  In addition, the President is committed to building hundreds of miles of integrated, tactical infrastructure along the Southern border, which includes vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting to help detect, deter, and prevent people from entering our country illegally.
The Administration Has Effectively Ended ""Catch And Release"" For Illegal Aliens Apprehended At The Borders.  In FY06 and FY07 the Administration funded 6,700 new detention beds, for a total of 27,500 detention beds this fiscal year.
The Administration Expanded The Use Of ""Expedited Removal,"" Which Allows Us To Send Illegal Immigrants Home More Quickly.  The President is also working with Congress to mitigate court-imposed requirements that the Federal government release dangerous criminal aliens if their home countries do not take them back within a certain period of time.
The Administration Is Working Closely With State And Local Law Enforcement To Stop Illegal Immigration.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has the resources to train 1,500 State and local law enforcement officers under the 287(g) program in 2006 and 2007.  DHS will work with its State and local partners to expand these programs, and received $50 million in 2006 supplemental funding for this effort.  In addition, DHS is expanding to State and local law enforcement agencies the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) previously in place with the Federal Bureau of Prisons to identify illegal aliens who are incarcerated in Federal, State, and local jails.
2. We Must Hold Employers Accountable For The Workers They Hire
In A Sharp Break From The Past, The Administration Is Addressing The Illegal Employment Of Undocumented Workers With A Tough Combination Of Criminal Prosecution And Forfeitures.  Previously, worksite enforcement relied on a combination of administrative hearings and fines.  The fines were so modest that some employers treated them as merely a cost of doing business, and employment of undocumented workers continued unabated. 
The Number Of Arrests In Worksite Enforcement Cases Has Increased Dramatically During The President's Time In Office.  There were more than 4,300 arrests in worksite enforcement cases for 2006, more than seven times the arrests in 2002.  In addition, the two largest worksite enforcement actions in U.S. history were conducted last year by ICE.
In Fall 2005, The President Signed A Bill Doubling Federal Resources For Worksite Enforcement.  In addition,the Administration has launched law enforcement task forces in 11 major cities to dismantle criminal rings that produce fake documents.
DHS Has Issued A Proposed ""No-Match"" Regulation To Assist Employers In Ensuring A Legal Workplace And To Help The Government Identify And Crack Down On Employers Who Knowingly Hire Illegal Workers.  In cases in which an employer has ten or more employees with inaccurate information, the Social Security Administration (SSA) sends the employer a ""No-Match"" letter.  DHS's proposed ""No-Match"" regulation clarifies that employers may be held civilly and criminally liable when a letter is sent and employers ignore the discrepancies between SSA databases and the information provided about their employees. 
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Must Include The Creation Of A New, Tamper-Proof Identification Card For Every Legal Foreign Worker So Businesses Can Verify The Legal Status Of Their Employees.  A tamper-proof card would help us enforce the law and leave employers with no excuse for violating it.  We will also work with Congress to expand ""Basic Pilot"" – an electronic employment eligibility verification system – and mandate that all employers use this system.
3. To Secure Our Border, We Must Create A Temporary Worker Program
America's Immigration Problem Will Not Be Solved With Security Measures Alone.  There are many people on the other side of our borders who will do anything to come to America to work and build a better life.  This dynamic creates tremendous pressure on our border that walls and patrols alone cannot stop.
As We Tighten Controls At The Border, We Must Also Address The Needs Of America's Growing Economy.  The rule of law cannot permit unlawful employment of millions of undocumented workers in the United States.  Many American businesses, however, depend on hiring willing foreign workers for jobs that Americans are not doing.
To Provide A Lawful Channel For Employment That Will Benefit Both The United States And Individual Immigrants, The President Has Called For The Creation Of A Temporary Worker Program.  Such a program will serve the needs of our economy by providing a lawful and fair way to match willing employers with willing foreign workers to fill jobs that Americans have not taken.  The program will also serve our law enforcement and national security objectives by taking pressure off the border and freeing our hard-working Border Patrol to focus on terrorists, human traffickers, violent criminals, drug runners, and gangs. 
The Temporary Worker Program Should Be Grounded In The Following Principles:
American Workers Must Be Given Priority Over Guest Workers.  Employers should be allowed to hire guest workers only for jobs that Americans have not taken.
The Program Must Be Truly Temporary.  Participation should be for a limited period of time, and the guest workers must return home after their authorized period of stay.  Those who fail to return home in accordance with the law should become permanently ineligible for a green card and for citizenship.
Participation Should Fluctuate With Market Conditions.  When the economy is booming, and there are not enough American workers available to help businesses grow, the program should be open to more participants.  But when times are tough and Americans struggle to find jobs, the economy cannot and should not support as many guest workers.
4. We Must Bring Undocumented Workers Already In The Country Out Of The Shadows
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Must Account For The Millions Of Immigrants Already In The Country Illegally.  Illegal immigration causes serious problems, putting pressure on public schools and hospitals and straining State and local budgets.  People who have worked hard, supported their families, avoided crime, led responsible lives, and become a part of American life should be called in out of the shadows and under the rule of American law.
The President Opposes An Automatic Path To Citizenship Or Any Other Form Of Amnesty.  Amnesty, as a reward for lawbreaking, would only invite further lawbreaking.  Amnesty would also be unfair to those lawful immigrants who have patiently waited their turn for citizenship and to those who are still waiting to enter the country legally.
The President Supports A Rational Middle Ground Between A Program Of Mass Deportation And A Program Of Automatic Amnesty.  It is neither wise nor realistic to round up and deport millions of illegal immigrants in the United States. But there should be no automatic path to citizenship.  The President supports a rational middle ground founded on the following basic tenets:
No Amnesty.  Workers who have entered the country illegally and workers who have overstayed their visas must pay a substantial penalty for their illegal conduct. 
In Addition To Paying A Meaningful Penalty, Undocumented Workers Must Learn English, Pay Their Taxes, Pass A Background Check, And Hold A Job For A Number Of Years Before They Will Be Eligible To Be Considered For Legalized Status.
Any Undocumented Worker Seeking Citizenship Must Go To The ""Back Of The Line.""  The program should not reward illegal conduct by making participants eligible for citizenship ahead of those who have played by the rules and followed the law.  Instead, program participants must wait their turn at the back of the line.
5. We Must Promote Assimilation Into Our Society By Teaching New Immigrants English And American Values
Those Who Swear The Oath Of Citizenship Are Doing More Than Completing A Legal Process – They Are Making A Lifelong Pledge To Support The Values And The Laws Of America.  Americans are bound together by our shared ideals, our history, and the ability to speak and write the English language.  Every new citizen has an obligation to learn the English language and the customs and values that define our Nation, including liberty and civic responsibility, appreciation for our history, tolerance for others, and equality. When immigrants assimilate, they advance in our society, realize their dreams, and add to the unity of America.
New Citizens Need Guidance To Succeed.  The Office of Citizenship is creating new guides for immigrants and introducing a new pilot civics examination designed to foster a deeper understanding of civic virtues and the founding ideals.  The President's Task Force on New Americans is fostering volunteerism through volunteer.gov and exploring partnerships with local organizations.  Public libraries and faith-based and community groups will be encouraged to offer English language and civics instruction to immigrants who are seeking to make America their home.

Since September 11, the federal government has drastically increased funding for immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexican border in the name of national security. The government has funded, among other things, complex and expensive surveillance technology and many new border patrol agents. But we lack a measure of performance. Have costly border enforcement measures actually made us safer from a terrorist threat?
At the Mexican border the government is using a deterrence-based approach to stemming undocumented migration. More border militarization and more apprehensions of migrants, the theory goes, deter future migrants seeking to cross the U.S.-Mexican border and thus decrease overall undocumented migration. Reducing unauthorized migration, in turn, is presumed to lessen the likelihood that a would-be terrorist will cross the border.
The government has spent billions of dollars on its deterrencebased model. It has implemented, on a pilot basis, technology to track the hundreds of thousands of individuals who enter the United States each year. The government has also increased spending for law enforcement agents at the border. From fiscal years 1993 to 2005, the Border Patrol budget quadrupled from $362 million to $1.4 billion, and the number of Border Patrol agents nearly tripled.
But the available evidence indicates that the government’s deterrence-based approach has not reduced undocumented migration at the Mexican border. As Walter Ewing of the Immigration Policy Center has observed, though spending on border militarization has skyrocketed over the past decade, the pace of undocumented migration has risen during the same time period. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, the number of undocumented migrants—including those who cross the border without papers and those who overstay valid visas—increased from about 400,000 annually between 1990 and 1994 to 850,000 between 2000 and 2005.
Before pouring additional money into deterrence-based border enforcement in the name of national security, we should ask whether enforcement works. Common sense suggests that individualized, human intelligence about a few potential terrorists is more effective than broad-scale border enforcement that targets hundreds of thousands of migrants. However, if government border policy is based on a desire to reduce undocumented migration from Mexico for its sake alone, then national security should not be part of the discussion.
At a minimum, without clear goals and performance measures, we cannot know whether our border efforts have improved national
security. All we know is that our government has spent a great deal of money. And the cost of the government’s border policy extends beyond dollars and cents. Increased border enforcement has made it more difficult and dangerous for migrants to cross. More border personnel and technology have led to an expansion in immigrant smuggling, already a very profitable business. Undocumented migrants pay thousands of dollars to make the increasingly dangerous crossing into the United States. The combination of demand for cheap labor in the United States, few channels for legal migration, and poor economic conditions in Mexico and Central America results in a steady stream of migrants who are willing to pay high fees and risk their lives to cross our border for better opportunities. A recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that migrant deaths doubled at the southwest border during the 1995 to 2005 time frame, mainly due to deaths occurring in the Arizona desert.
The notion that deterring immigration works because we have not suffered another tragic attack is not enough. This kind of rhetoric appeals to our emotions, not our intelligence. Of course, emotion has always been a large part of our immigration policy. To some extent, deciding whether to admit an immigrant is about deciding whether we want to welcome the individual into our national community. But, when the stakes are so high, we should not let the emotions about immigration policy guide our efforts to ensure national security. We should have a clear understanding of whether our government has implemented a fiscally responsible, sustainable, and effective policy to prepare for future terrorist attacks.
It is time for a performance evaluation on national security and border enforcement at the U.S.-Mexican border. If a deterrencebased border policy does not make us safer, we should abandon our approach.

      President Bush Signs Secure Fence Act
      In Focus: Homeland Security
""This bill will help protect the American people. This bill will make our borders more secure. It is an important step toward immigration reform.""
- President George W. Bush, 10/26/06
Today, President Bush Signed The Secure Fence Act - An Important Step Forward In Our Nation's Efforts To Control Our Borders And Reform Our Immigration System. Earlier this year, the President laid out a strategy for comprehensive immigration reform. The Secure Fence Act is one part of this reform, and the President will work with Congress to finish the job and pass the remaining elements of this strategy.
The Secure Fence Act Builds On Progress Securing The Border
By Making Wise Use Of Physical Barriers And Deploying 21st Century Technology, We Can Help Our Border Patrol Agents Do Their Job And Make Our Border More Secure. The Secure Fence Act:
Authorizes the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along our Southern border;
Authorizes more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting to help prevent people from entering our country illegally;
Authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology like cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce our infrastructure at the border.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Begins With Securing The Border. Since President Bush took office, we have:
More than doubled funding for border security - from $4.6 billion in 2001 to $10.4 billion this year;
Increased the number of Border Patrol agents from about 9,000 to more than 12,000 - and by the end of 2008, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents since the President took office;
Deployed thousands of National Guard members to assist the Border Patrol;
Upgraded technology at our borders and added infrastructure, including new fencing and vehicle barriers;
Apprehended and sent home more than 6 million people entering America illegally; and
We are adding thousands of new beds in our detention facilities, so we can continue working to end ""catch and release"" at our Southern border.
This Act Is One Part Of Our Effort To Reform Our Immigration System, And We Have More Work To Do
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Requires That We Enforce Our Immigration Laws Inside America. It is against the law to knowingly hire illegal workers, so the Administration has stepped up worksite enforcement. Many businesses want to obey the law, but cannot verify the legal status of their employees because of the widespread problem of document fraud, so the President has also called on Congress to create a better system for verifying documents and work eligibility.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Requires That We Reduce The Pressure On Our Border By Creating A Lawful Path For Foreign Workers To Enter Our Country On A Temporary Basis. A temporary worker program would meet the needs of our economy, reduce the appeal of human smugglers, make it less likely that people would risk their lives to cross the border, and ease the financial burden on State and local governments by replacing illegal workers with lawful taxpayers. Above all, a temporary worker program would add to our security by making certain we know who is in our country and why they are here.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Requires That We Face The Reality That Millions Of Illegal Immigrants Are Here Already. The President opposes amnesty but believes there is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant and a program of mass deportation. Illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay should have to pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law, pay their taxes, learn English, work in a job for a number of years, and wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed the law.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Requires That We Honor The Great American Tradition Of The Melting Pot. Americans are bound together by our shared ideals, an appreciation of our history, respect for the flag we fly, and an ability to speak and write the English language. When immigrants assimilate and advance in our society, they realize their dreams, renew our spirit, and add to the unity of America.

For Immediate Release
Office of the Press Secretary
May 18, 2006
Fact Sheet: President Requests Funds to Strengthen Border Security
      In Focus: Immigration
     
Today, the President sent Congress a request for $1.948 billion in emergency funding to help secure America's borders. The request includes funding for the first 1,000 of 6,000 new border patrol agents that will be deployed in the next two years and the resources to train them, the temporary deployment of up to 6,000 National Guard troops to assist the Border Patrol with surveillance and logistics, new border security technology and infrastructure, and 4,000 new detention beds.
The President believes America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time. We will fix the problem of illegal immigration, and we will deliver a system that is secure, orderly, and fair.
Border security is part of the President's vision for comprehensive immigration reform. The President outlined to the American people Monday night a five-point plan that includes increased border security, a temporary worker program, accountability for employers, a strategy to deal with the millions of illegal immigrants who are already here without granting amnesty, and continuing America's melting pot tradition.
Today's request does not increase the cost of the Administration's supplemental request. These funds are offset by reductions elsewhere in the Administration's original emergency request for the War on Terror. The President will veto the emergency supplemental appropriations bill if it exceeds $92.2 billion for any reason other than funding needed to prepare for a possible avian flu pandemic or if it includes non-emergency or wasteful spending.
Department of Homeland Security: $1.172 billion
Customs and Border Protection & Federal Law Enforcement Training Center: $830 million
More Border Patrol Agents: $235 million for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents and related support costs, $50 million for additional recruiting and expanded training capacity at the Border Patrol Academy, $25 million to expand the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, and $20 million for additional office staff to free-up agents for law enforcement duties. Funding for 1,500 additional agents was included in the President's FY2007 Budget and funding for 3,500 agents will be sought over the next two years, in order to deploy 6,000 new agents by the end of 2008.
Increased Physical Security: $250 million for enhanced security infrastructure including vehicle barriers, lighting, all-weather roads, and fencing, as well as $75 million for new high-tech communication and command and control resources.
More Air Support: $95 million for two additional unmanned aerial vehicles and five additional helicopters.
New Facilities and Equipment: $50 million for new and expanded stations, checkpoints, and forward operating bases to accommodate new agents and their supplies, and $30 million to replace worn-out vehicles in the Border Patrol's 9,000-vehicle pool.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement & State and Local Government Assistance: $342 million
Detention Beds to End Catch-and-Release: $80 million for 4,000 new beds, which will help end catch-and-release along the southern border.
Detention Staff: $70 million for detention and removal staff and $30 million for enhanced fugitive operations and detention alternatives.
Increased Removal and Transportation: $97 million to transport aliens and return them to their own countries.
Assisting State and Local Efforts: $50 million to train state and local law enforcement authorities to assist the Border Patrol and other Federal officers on targeted enforcement missions, and $15 million for ""Operation Stonegarden"" initiatives in selected states to enable state, local, and tribal law enforcement personnel to coordinate directly with Federal Customs and Border Protection personnel to increase patrol presence, provide traffic-control support at the border and at checkpoints, and participate in Integrated Border Enforcement Teams.
National Guard: $756 million
To Help During This Period Of Transition And In Coordination With Governors, Up To 6,000 National Guard Members Will Be Sent To Our Southern Border. The Department of Homeland Security, and specifically the Border Patrol, will remain in the lead. National Guard units will assist the Border Patrol by operating surveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and vehicle barriers, building patrol roads, and providing training. National Guard units deployed to our border will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities - that duty will be done by the Border Patrol.
This Initial Commitment Of Guard Members Would Last For One Year. After that, the number of National Guard members will be reduced as new Border Patrol agents are added and new technologies come online. At any one time, these 6,000 Guard members account for less than 2 percent of the total National Guard force of more than 440,000. Guard members will be deployed in two- to three-week rotations to meet this 6,000 person level. We have enough National Guard members to deploy to our border, while continuing to respond to natural disasters and fight and win the War on Terror.
The President Is Committed To Working With Our Nation's Governors. Military personnel will be employed consistent with applicable Federal, state, and local law. The National Guard Bureau will serve as the coordinating authority to deploy National Guard units from across the country to perform the border security mission in support of DHS. The National Guard units will remain under the command and control of their respective State Governors and Adjutants General.
The United States Is Not Going To Militarize The Southern Border. Mexico is our neighbor and friend. We will continue to work cooperatively to improve security on both sides of the border, confront common problems like drug trafficking and crime, and reduce illegal immigration.
Department of Justice: $20 million. New funding is requested for additional administrative law judges, immigration attorneys, and technical and clerical staff to support the timely disposition of an expected increase in immigration hearings, and new funding for enhanced law enforcement efforts by United States Attorneys along the southern border.
The Request does not increase the cost of the Administration's supplemental request. The President has promised to veto the emergency supplemental bill if it exceeds $92.2 billion for any reason other than for preparations for a possible avian flu pandemic or if it includes non-emergency or wasteful spending. Today's request is consistent with that promise. The funds are fully offset by reductions elsewhere in the Administration's original February supplemental request by delaying certain less-urgent military procurement efforts to future appropriations legislation. There will be no proposed reductions that would impact personnel or operational activities necessary to the War on Terror. Many of these offsets are similar to ones already identified by Congress.
The House And Senate Must Pass A Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill
All Elements Of This Problem Must Be Addressed Together - Or None Of Them Will Be Solved At All. The House has passed an immigration bill. The Senate should act by the end of this month - so that the House and Senate can work out their differences and send the President a comprehensive bill to sign.
America Needs To Conduct This Debate In A Reasoned And Respectful Tone. Feelings run deep on the matter of immigration - and as we work out this issue, all of us need to keep some things in mind. We cannot build a unified country by inciting people to anger, or playing on anyone's fears, or exploiting the issue of immigration for political gain. We must always remember that real lives will be affected by our debates and decisions, and that every human being has dignity and value no matter what their citizenship papers say.

For Immediate Release
Office of the Press Secretary
June 1, 2006
Fact Sheet: Comprehensive Immigration Reform: Improving Worksite Enforcement
      President Discusses Comprehensive Immigration Reform
      In Focus: Immigration
     
Today, President Bush Discussed His Plan For Comprehensive Immigration Reform. One of the most important tests of immigration reform will be the enforcement of our immigration laws in the interior of our country. The Administration is taking action to improve worksite enforcement - and expects businesses to help.
Congress Is Now Moving Forward With Legislation To Reform Our Immigration System. The House started this debate by passing a bill that focuses on border security and interior enforcement. Now the Senate has passed a comprehensive bill that also includes a temporary worker program and a plan to resolve the status of illegal immigrants who are already in our country. Working out the differences between the House and Senate bills will require effort and compromise on both sides. Yet the difficulty of this task is no excuse for avoiding it.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Must Hold Employers To Account For The Workers They Hire
Funding For Immigration Enforcement Inside Our Country Has Increased By 42 Percent Since The President Took Office, And Last Year, The President Signed A Bill Doubling Federal Resources For Worksite Enforcement. We have also launched law enforcement task forces in 11 major cities to dismantle criminal rings that produce fake documents. All these efforts are helping us enforce our immigration laws at the worksite.
The Federal Government Has A Responsibility To Ensure That Businesses Have A Clear And Reliable Way To Check Work Documents. Today there is an entire underground industry dedicated to producing fake IDs and fraudulent Social Security numbers. Under current law, the immigration enforcement agents at the Department of Homeland Security are not informed when the Social Security Administration discovers a mismatch between a worker and the Social Security Number he or she provides. We need to address these problems and ensure that our agents can enforce the law.
Basic Pilot Is Helping Businesses Comply With The Law. Basic Pilot is a voluntary, online verification system that allows employers to confirm the eligibility of new hires by checking the information they provide against Federal databases.
When President Bush Took Office, Basic Pilot Was Available In Only Six States, And Today It Is Available Nationwide. The President's FY 2007 budget requests $111 million to expand Basic Pilot.
Congress Needs To Make This Program Mandatory And Provide Homeland Security With The Funding And Authority To Make It Work. Basic Pilot is still optional, and most employers do not participate. Both the House and Senate immigration bills would require employers to use Basic Pilot.
To Help Combat Document Fraud, President Bush Has Proposed The Creation Of A New Identification Card For Every Legal Foreign Worker. This card should use biometric technology, such as digital fingerprints, to help make it tamper-proof. With a tamper-proof card, American employers would know that a foreign job applicant is who he says he is - and is in our country legally. A tamper-proof card would be a vital tool to enforce the law, and it must be part of any comprehensive immigration reform.
Improving Enforcement Of Our Immigration Laws Also Requires Stiffening The Penalties For Violating Those Laws. President Bush proposes to increase penalties for employers who violate the law - and to make fines even larger for employers who repeatedly violate the law.
American Businesses Have A Clear Responsibility To Obey The Law. Businesses that knowingly employ illegal workers are undermining our laws, violating the public trust, and contributing to the problem of illegal immigration - and the Administration will not tolerate it.
By Cracking Down On Document Fraud, The Administration Will Help Honest Employers Follow The Law And Will Punish Those Who Violate It. With an effective verification system and a tamper-proof card, employers would have the tools they need to check the work status of job applicants, and there would be no excuse for hiring an illegal worker. And with an effective verification system and a tamper-proof card, illegal workers would have less incentive to cross the border in the first place.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Must Help Us Secure Our Borders
President Bush Has Called On Congress To Provide Funding For Dramatic Improvements In Manpower And Technology At The Border. Since the President took office, we have increased funding for border security by 66 percent, and expanded the Border Patrol from about 9,000 to 12,000 agents. By the end of 2008, we will increase the number of Border Patrol officers by an additional 6,000 - doubling the size of the Border Patrol since the President took office. At the same time, we will construct high-tech fences in urban corridors and build new patrol roads and barriers in rural areas. We will create a virtual fence that employs motion sensors, infrared cameras, and unmanned aerial vehicles to detect and prevent illegal crossings.
This Month, National Guard Units Will Deploy To The Border To Set Up The Headquarters That Will Help Coordinate Guard Operations In Support Of The Border Patrol. These forces are the first of up to 6,000 Guard members who will assist the Border Patrol by operating surveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and vehicle barriers, building patrol roads, and providing training. Guard units will not be involved in direct law enforcement activities, and as new Border Patrol agents and new technologies come online, the number of Guard forces will be reduced.
The Federal Government Is Now Working To Conclude Formal Agreements With California, Arizona, New Mexico, And Texas That Will Define The Role And Responsibilities Of National Guard Units Deploying To The Southern Border. President Bush will continue to work closely with the Governors of these States to secure our border. He has also spoken with the chief of the National Guard Bureau, Lieutenant General Steven Blum, about the work the Guard will be doing to improve border security.
We Will Increase Federal Funding For State And Local Authorities Assisting The Border Patrol On Targeted Enforcement Missions. We will give State and local authorities the specialized training they need to help Federal officers apprehend and detain illegal immigrants. This will help during the period of transition as new Border Patrol agents and new technologies come online.
We Will End The Practice Of ""Catch And Release"" Along The Southern Border.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Must Create A Temporary Worker Program That Helps Us Secure The Border
A Temporary Worker Program Would Create A Legal Path For Foreign Workers To Enter Our Country In An Orderly Way, For A Limited Period Of Time. Above all, a temporary worker program would add to our security by making certain we know who is in our country and why they are here.
A Temporary Worker Program Would Meet The Legitimate Needs Of American Employers, And It Would Give Honest Immigrants A Way To Provide For Their Families While Respecting The Law.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Must Address The Reality That Millions Of Illegal Immigrants Are Here Already
The President Opposes Amnesty. Amnesty would be unfair to those who are here lawfully, and it would invite further waves of illegal immigration. There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant and a program that requires every illegal immigrant to leave.
The President Believes Illegal Immigrants Who Have Roots In Our Country And Want To Stay Should Have To Pay A Meaningful Penalty For Breaking The Law, Pay Their Taxes, Learn English, And Work In A Job For A Number Of Years. People who meet these conditions should eventually be permitted to apply for citizenship like other foreign workers, but approval would not be automatic - and they will have to wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed the law.
Comprehensive Immigration Reform Must Honor The Great American Tradition Of The Melting Pot
The Success Of Our Country Depends Upon Helping Newcomers Assimilate Into Our Society And Embrace Our Common Identity As Americans. When immigrants assimilate and advance in our society, they realize their dreams, they renew our spirit, and they add to the unity of America.
English Is The Key To Unlocking The Opportunity Of America. English allows newcomers to go from picking crops to opening a grocery, from cleaning offices to running offices, from a life of low-paying jobs to a diploma, a career, and a home of their own.

President's Remarks

      In Focus: Immigration
     
12:51 P.M. PDT
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much for allowing me to come by and say hello. It's good to be here in Yuma. I'd never been to Yuma before. (Laughter.) I'd like to come back. It's a hospitable place with good weather. (Laughter.) Remember, I was raised in West Texas. (Laughter.)
I've come down here to first of all thank the men and women of the Border Patrol for doing a fine job on behalf of the American people. A lot of time you don't get the credit you deserve, but there's a lot of folks who understand how hard you work. And we really appreciate it. So on behalf of a grateful nation, thanks for doing an important job. (Applause.)
I'm down here to talk about the immigration issue. And this is an important issue. It really is. It's an important debate our country is having. We need to have -- we need to secure our border, and we need fair and effective immigration laws. The other night I spoke to the country about the way I see it, and I'm looking forward to working with the United States Congress to get something done.
There's a lot of politics in Washington, D.C. And it's time to get rid of all the politics and do what's right for the United States of America and help you do your job. And that's why I've come to this part of the world. I wanted to hear firsthand from David and Ronald Colburn what they need to get the job done, and where we're making progress and where we aren't making progress.
I think it helps to have the President out here, seeing the part of the area of the country that one time was overrun by people coming in here, that's beginning to get settled down because of a strategy that's being employed. And so I really want to thank you all for greeting me. Plus I liked riding in the dune buggy. (Laughter.)
I appreciate very much your governor for being here. Governor Napolitano is with us today. Thank you very much for coming. I'm honored you're here. She's an important person as part of helping to implement this strategy -- after all, she's the commander-in-chief of the Arizona National Guard. And I'm going to talk a little bit about the Guard's presence here on the border to help the Border Patrol do its job.
But I also want to thank the members of the United States Congress who flew out here with me. It's a good bunch, a little rambunctious at times, but they're -- I enjoy being with them. I call them friends. Congressmen Kolbe, Hayworth, Shadegg, Flake and Franks -- appreciate you guys taking time out of your day to come down. You care a lot about your state, and you care a lot about this issue. And I appreciate you being here.
I want to thank Senator Ken Bennett. He's the president of the Arizona Senate. Senator, you didn't need to come down here, but I'm grateful you did. And I also want to thank Speaker Weiers for being here, as well. I appreciate your interest in the subject. The mayor -- Mayor Larry Nelson is with us. Mr. Mayor, thank you for coming.
I want to thank all the other state and local officials. I want to thank Major General David Rataczak. He's the head of the Arizona National Guard. We're going to be working with our Guard. Don't go overboard for the guy. (Laughter.) We're going to be working closely with our Guard around the country to help the Border Patrol do its job.
I want to thank all the folks who are here for taking time out of your day to give me a chance to come and visit. I particularly want to thank the local law enforcement officials, as well.
I understand that illegal immigration is a serious problem. And one of our jobs in public office is to fix problems, is to deal with a problem in a rational way and not pass them on to other people. And I spoke to the country the other night because I want to fix the problem. And I want to work with people in Washington to do so. People here know firsthand that illegal immigration puts big pressure on our local communities, puts pressures on the schools, puts pressures on the hospitals, puts pressure on the state and local budgets, puts pressures on your penal system. I know that.
Our country is a country of laws, and we've got to enforce our laws. But we're also a nation of immigrants. And we've got to remember that proud tradition, as well, which has strengthened our country in many ways. These are not contradictory goals to remember our heritage and uphold our laws. America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time.
There's a debate in Washington, and the House started the debate by passing a strong enforcement bill last December. And now the Senate is debating. And I do want to compliment the senators from this state -- Senator McCain and Senator Kyl -- for taking the lead. They understand the importance of getting this issue solved, and they're on the floor of the Senate debating a good immigration bill. And they've offered thoughtful proposals for which I am grateful.
The Senate needs to get the bill out, and get it to what they call the conference committee so we can work hard to iron out the differences between the House and the Senate. I support -- strongly support a comprehensive reform bill, though. It needs to have five key elements to it.
First, as I mentioned to you, we're going to secure our borders. That is the duty of our country. It's a sovereign responsibility. We want the border to be open to trade and lawful immigration, and we want our borders shut to illegal immigrants, as well as criminals and drug dealers and terrorists. That's the objective.
You might remember I was the governor of a border state, so I understand how big the border is. I would suggest to members of Congress as they debate this issue that they ought to come down and take a look at the border, see what it's really like. It requires an intense focus of resources and assets in order to secure this border. It also requires a comprehensive strategy, as well.
Since I became the President we've increased funding for our border security by 66 percent. That's helped upgrade equipment, infrastructure. Border Patrol agents have gone from 9,000 -- about 9,000 to nearly 12,000, a significant increase of Border Patrol agents so that we can have more people in the front lines of doing our duty.
Here we've added about -- more than 100 Border Patrol agents in the Yuma sector in the last year. In other words, people are beginning to see, those on the front line of protecting the border are beginning to see additional agents coming on board. That's about an increase of 20 percent to more than 660 agents. This border -- this sector was overwhelmed at one time from people coming across illegally. I understand that. And one way to help deal with that problem is to increase the number of agents on the front line, which is what the leadership of the Border Patrol has done.
We saw some new fencing taking place. It makes sense to use fencing along the border in key locations in order to do our job. We saw lighting. I just saw the cameras in place where we're beginning to install -- modernize the border is what I'm telling you. We're in the process of making our border the most technologically advanced border in the world.
Interestingly enough, I don't think enough Americans know this, but over the past five years, federal agents, like our Border Patrol agents, have apprehended and sent home about 6 million people -- 6 million people since 2001 have come into this country illegally. I mean, we've got some people working hard.
Last year, agents in the Yuma sector apprehended more than 70,000 illegal entrants. That's up from 14 percent [sic]. People's work is making a difference, but we do not have full control of the border. And that's what I want you all to understand I realize, and a lot of people in Congress realize.
And so here's the part -- here's the strategy. We're going to increase our Border Patrol by another 6,000 agents that will have doubled the Border Patrol from 2001. We should have those agents on line by 2008. We're going to make sure we continue to be wise about how we enable you to do your job better, with technologies and high-tech fences in urban corridors and patrol roads and barriers in rural areas and motion sensors, infrared cameras, unmanned aerial vehicles. All the equipment is aimed to enable the Border Patrol to do their job. We're adding additional equipment which will enable the 18,000 Border Patrol agents we'll have in place to be able to effectively control this border.
It's going to take time to get the technology in place, and it's going to take time to train the Border Patrol agents. And yet, the need to enforce the border is urgent, and that's why, in coordination with our governors, we're going to send 6,000 National Guard troops to be deployed on the southern border.
Now, the reason why I think this strategy is important is because deploying the 6,000 troops to complement the work of the Border Patrol will get immediate results. And it's time to get immediate results. And so I want to thank governors like Janet for her understanding about the need to utilize assets to do our job, to enforce the border.
The Guard is going to support border control efforts. And the Border Patrol, of course, will be in the lead. The Guard will operate surveillance and communications systems. They will install fences and vehicle barriers. They're going to help build patrol roads. They'll analyze intelligence. They will help spot people. But the Border Patrol will be involved in direct law enforcement. The Guard is going to free up agents to be in direct contact with those trying to sneak across. It is -- the Guard is complementary. The Guard makes it easier for the Border Patrol to do its job.
And the initial commitment will last for about a year for the 6,000 for the Guard, and after that, the forces will be reduced as new Border Patrol agents and new equipment comes online.
There are more than 400 Guard members deployed along the southwest border. In other words, this is something we've tried. This isn't anything new. The governor has deployed Guard down here before. We've got Guard already helping the Border Patrol right now. The missions are directly related to their specific skills. In this sector, men and women from the Arizona Guard are assisting with communications and intelligence. Guard personnel from Pennsylvania and Ohio are helping install new infrastructure and technology.
So the strategy I'm announcing -- I announced last Monday has already started to work. State and local law enforcement in border communities are also a part of the strategy. And so we're going to draw on their expertise and provide new resources. We're going to increase federal funding for state and local authorities assisting the Border Patrol on targeted law enforcement missions. The federal government isn't telling you what to do. But we are saying that if you choose to help the Border Patrol, that you'll be reimbursed for targeted enforcement missions. And we're going to help -- we'll give state and local authorities specialized training to help federal officers apprehend and detain illegal immigrants.
As we catch more people crossing the border illegally, we got to make sure they're all returned home. And one of the problems we've had here in the border, that Border Patrol agents will tell you, is the problem of catch and release. Now, more than 85 percent of illegal immigrants caught -- who get caught crossing the border are from Mexico. And they're sent home within 24 hours, and that's good. Part of having a secure border is people have got to understand when you're caught, you're sent home.
But the problem is, is that it's not so easy to send home illegal immigrants from other countries. For many years, we didn't have enough space in detention facilities. You all know that. And so what would happen is, somebody would get caught, the Border Patrol would do their job, they'd work hard to enforce the border, and some of the -- a judge would say, show back up, we'll see you back here in 30 days. Well, guess what? There was nobody back in 30 days. They went and headed into society. We've got to stop that practice. In order to make sure the Border Patrol is effective and do their jobs, I can't think of, frankly, anything more discouraging than to be out there doing -- working as hard as you possibly can, apprehend somebody, and the next thing you know, they're let back out.
And so we're going to add detention facilities. We'll continue to -- we've added some already, we're going to continue to add more. We're going to expedite the legal process to cut the average deportation time. And the State Department, along with the White House, is going to continue to work with governments to say, look, we want you to take these folks back; you've got to make sure that when we start sending them back that you take them back.
And we're making some pretty good progress. We've caught -- we've ended catch and release for illegal immigrants from some countries. And so I'm going to ask country for funding and legal authority to end catch and release at the southern border once and for all for all countries.
I strongly believe that to have -- secure the border, we need to have a temporary worker program. And the reason why I do, is I understand there are many people on the other side of the border who will do anything to come and work. And that includes risking their life crossing your desert, or being willing to be stuffed in the back of an 18-wheeler. I believe in order for the Border Patrol to be able to effectively do their job, we've got to have a plan in place that will reduce the people who are trying to sneak across.
A temporary worker program would create a legal path for foreign workers to enter a country in an orderly way for a limited period of time. A temporary worker program would reduce the number of people trying to sneak across. A temporary worker program would reduce the appeal of human smugglers. There's a whole industry that has sprung up that traffics in human beings, that degrades the human soul. Coyotes -- that's a familiar word here in this part of the world. A lot of people around the country don't understand what a coyote is, but they're somebody who, for money, will smuggle people into the United States so they can work.
We want to know who is coming in the country, and who is not coming in the country. And so I think it makes sense to say, if someone is willing to do a job Americans aren't doing, here's a temporary way to come and work; here's a tamper-proof card, so you don't have to sneak across the border, you could walk across the border, and you can do that work, and when your time is up, you go home.
Now these people are going to have to pass a criminal background check, but we've got to recognize there are people here doing jobs Americans aren't doing. You know it as well as anybody in this part of the world. And it seems like to me there ought to be an orderly way, a rational way to deal with those workers with a temporary work plan.
And by the way, issuing a card, a tamper-proof card, will make it easier for us to enforce the law in the interior of our country. It is against the law for an employer to hire somebody who is here illegally. That's the law of the United States. We're a nation of laws, we'll uphold the laws, but how can you ask employers to uphold the laws when they're not sure whether the documents they're looking at are fraudulent?
So not only has the current immigration system caused a whole smuggling industry to come up, but there's also a document forgery industry. We want our employers to be able to be confident about who they're hiring. That's why we need a tamper-proof ID card, based upon modern biometrics.
Fourth, it is important to resolve the status of million [sic] illegal immigrants who are here already. First of all, in this debate there should be -- nobody should be given an automatic citizenship -- that's called amnesty. I oppose amnesty. Amnesty would be unfair to those who are here lawfully, to those who have played by the rules. Amnesty would undermine the rule of law. And amnesty would invite a further wave of illegal immigrants.
There are some in this country who believe we ought to deport everybody who has been here. I just don't think it's going to work. I don't think it makes sense. And so I believe there's a rational middle ground between automatic citizenship and a program of mass deportation.
And here it is: First, it's important for the law to distinguish between someone who has crossed the border illegally recently and someone who has worked here for many years and has a home and raised a family and has a clean record. For that person, the person who has got roots in our country, I believe that person should pay a meaningful fine, pay their taxes, learn English, prove they've worked in a job for a number of years, and then that person should be able to apply for citizenship, but would not be granted an automatic citizenship, but instead would be at the end of the citizenship line.
In other words, people have been here legally, somebody who pays their dues, pays their taxes, pays a fine, proven to be a good citizen, they get at the end of the line. Someone said, well, that's amnesty -- that's not amnesty. Amnesty is automatic citizenship. This is a rational way to deal with people who are God-fearing, decent people, and respect their dignity at the same time.
Fifth, we've got to honor the great American tradition of the melting pot. Americans are bound together by shared ideals and appreciation of our history, of respect for our flag and ability to speak the English language. There's certain things that unite us, no matter where we're from, or what our background has been.
I want people to understand, as we go through this debate, that I fully understand English is the key to unlocking opportunity in America. Part of the greatness of America is that we've been able to help assimilate people into our society, people from all kinds of backgrounds who have come here to seek a better life and become American, because we have the capacity to assimilate.
And part of that assimilation process is English. I believe this: If you learn English, and you're a hard worker, and you have a dream, you have the capacity from going from picking crops to owning the store, or from sweeping office floors to being an office manager. That's been the greatness of America, when you think about it. People have come here with a dream, and have worked hard, and realized that dream.
And yet, because we're from different backgrounds, we've all been able to be one America, one nation under God. And so part of a rational immigration plan has got to remember that helping people assimilate into our society is a really important part of making sure we have an immigration system that works.
I strongly believe that Congress needs to pass a comprehensive immigration bill, because you cannot secure the border unless you have all elements of a comprehensive plan in place. Doing our duty to secure the border requires a comprehensive approach. The United States Senate needs to end by the act -- act by the end of this month. They need to do their duty and get a bill out so we can get on about the business of getting a comprehensive bill to my desk.
We have a duty in Washington, D.C. to conduct this debate with dignity and honor. Immigration is an emotional issue. Sometimes people get carried away on the issue, and they -- in doing so, they forget the greatness of our country, that we are a land of immigrants; that we've always been a haven for better opportunity; that we welcome people who are willing to abide by our laws and work hard and raise their family and trust in the Almighty. America's greatness has been and always will be the fact that we are one nation under God.
Thanks for letting me come by. (Applause.)

For Immediate Release
Office of the Press Secretary
March 27, 2006
Fact Sheet: Comprehensive Immigration Reform: Securing Our Border, Enforcing Our Laws, and Upholding Our Values
      In Focus: Immigration
     
Today, President Bush Attended A Naturalization Ceremony And Discussed His Vision For Comprehensive Immigration Reform. The President supports comprehensive immigration reform to secure our border, improve enforcement of our laws, and uphold our values. The President also discussed his proposal for a temporary worker program that rejects amnesty, allows foreign workers to fill jobs no American is willing to do, and reduces smuggling and crime at the border.
America's Immigrant Heritage Continues To Shape Our Society. Our Nation is bound together by liberty and a conviction that all people are created with equal dignity and value. Through the generations, Americans have upheld that vision by welcoming new citizens from across the globe. Immigrants have helped shape our identity and sustain our economy.
The President Strongly Believes America Is Stronger And More Dynamic When New Citizens Are Welcomed. The President has called on Congress to increase the number of green cards that can lead to citizenship. He supports increasing the number of visas available for foreign-born workers in highly skilled fields. The President signed legislation creating a new Office of Citizenship at the Department of Homeland Security to promote knowledge of citizenship rights and procedures; the Office of Citizenship created a new official guide for immigrants, and the Administration is working with faith-based and community groups to offer civics and English-language courses. In July 2002, the President signed an Executive Order making foreign-born members of our military immediately eligible for citizenship. Over the past four years, more than 20,000 men and women in uniform have become citizens.
Every New Citizen Makes A Lifelong Pledge To Support The Values And Laws Of America. New citizens have an obligation to learn the customs and values that define our Nation - including liberty and civic responsibility, equality under God, tolerance for others, and the English language.
The President Welcomes A Civil And Dignified Debate On Comprehensive Immigration Reform. Congress is now considering immigration reform proposals. Immigration is an emotional topic, and we need to maintain our perspective as we conduct this debate.
To Keep The Promise Of America, We Must Enforce The Laws Of America
President Bush's Proposal For Comprehensive Immigration Reform Includes Three Critical Elements - Securing The Border, Strengthening Enforcement Inside The Country, And Creating A Temporary Worker Program. These elements depend on and reinforce one another. Together, they will give America an immigration system that meets 21st century demands.
The First Element Is Securing Our Border. Since President Bush took office, funding for border security has increased by 66 percent. The Border Patrol has been expanded to more than 12,000 agents, an increase of more than 2,700 agents, or nearly 30 percent. The President's FY07 budget funds another 1,500 new agents. Agents are being provided with cutting-edge technology like infrared cameras, advanced motion sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Protective infrastructure, such as vehicle barriers and fencing in urban areas, is being installed. Manpower, technology, and infrastructure are being integrated in more unified ways than ever before.
The Administration's Border Security Strategy Is Getting Results. Since President Bush took office, agents have apprehended and sent home more than 6 million people entering the country illegally - including more than 400,000 with criminal records. Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement are working together. More than 600,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended through the Arizona Border Control Initiative last year - an increase of more than 50 percent increase over the previous year. The men and women of our Border Patrol have made good progress - but we have much more work ahead, and we will not be satisfied until our agents have full control of our border.
The Administration Is Ending The Practice Of ""Catch And Release."" The President has set a goal to end ""catch and release"" over the next year. Most illegal immigrants from Mexico can be returned to Mexico within 24 hours. Non-Mexican illegal immigrants present a different challenge. For decades, government detention facilities did not have enough beds for the non-Mexican illegal immigrants caught at the border - so most were released back into society. They were each assigned a court date, but virtually no one showed up. The Administration is ending the practice of ""catch and release"" by increasing the number of beds in detention facilities by 12 percent this year; the President's FY07 budget proposes increasing that number by another 32 percent. The Administration is expanding the use of ""expedited removal,"" which allows us to send non-Mexican illegal immigrants home more quickly.
We Are Making Progress In This Effort. Last year, it took an average of 66 days to process a non-Mexican illegal immigrant. Now, the process is taking only 21 days. This has helped us end ""catch and release"" for illegal immigrants from Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua caught crossing our Southwest border. Since last summer, the total number of non-Mexican illegal immigrants released into society has been cut by more than a third. There is more work ahead, and the Administration will work with Congress to close loopholes that make it difficult to process illegal immigrants from certain countries and will continue pressing foreign governments like China to take back their citizens who enter our country illegally.
The Second Element Is Strengthening Enforcement Of Our Laws In The Interior Of Our Country. Since President Bush took office, funding for immigration enforcement has increased by 42 percent. These resources have helped agents bring to justice smugglers, terrorists, gang members, and human traffickers. For example, through Operation Community Shield, Federal agents have arrested nearly 2,300 gang members who were in America illegally, including violent criminals like the members of the ""MS-13"" gang.
Better Interior Enforcement Requires Better Worksite Enforcement. Last year, President Bush signed legislation to more than double the resources dedicated to worksite enforcement. Next month, the Administration will launch new law enforcement task forces in 11 cities to dismantle document fraud rings.
The Third Element Is Creating A New Temporary Worker Program That Would Not Provide Amnesty. A temporary worker program would make the system more rational, orderly, and secure by providing a legal way to match willing foreign workers with willing American employers to fill jobs that no American is willing to do. Workers would be able to register for legal status on a temporary basis. If workers decided to apply for citizenship, they would have to get in line. This program would help meet the demands of our growing economy and allow honest workers to provide for their families while respecting the law.
A Temporary Worker Program Is Vital To Securing The Border. Creating a separate, legal channel for those entering America to do an honest day's labor would dramatically reduce the number of people attempting to sneak back and forth across the border. That would help take pressure off the border and free up law enforcement to focus on the greatest threats to our security - terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals. The program would also improve security by creating tamper-proof identification cards that would allow authorities to keep track of every temporary worker who is in America on a legal basis and help authorities identify those who are here illegally.
A Temporary Worker Program Should Not Provide Amnesty. Granting amnesty unfairly allows those who break the law to jump ahead of people who play by the rules and wait in the citizenship line. Amnesty would also encourage future waves of illegal immigration, increase pressure on the border, and make it more difficult for law enforcement to focus on those who mean us harm. For the sake of justice and the sake of border security, the President firmly opposes amnesty.

Say hello to the new face of efficiency, security and safety
Introducing Biometric Facial Comparison Technology
Where is it Deployed?
  CBP has successfully implemented facial biometrics into the entry processes at all international airports, known as Simplified Arrival, and into the exit processes at 49 airport locations. CBP also expanded facial biometrics at 38 seaports and all pedestrian lanes at both Southwest Border and the Northern Border ports of entry.
To date, CBP has processed more than 300 million travelers using biometric facial comparison technology and prevented more than 1,900 impostors from entry to the U.S.
Biometrics create a better, safer world.
OVERVIEW
CBP is leading the way in innovative identity verification efforts through its use of facial biometric comparison technology. The use of this technology allows CBP to make existing travel requirements more efficient thereby creating a more seamless, secure and safer experience for travelers.
The implementation of biometric technology stems from the 9/11 Commission Report which authorized the U.S. Government to use an automated system to record the arrivals and departures of visitors at all air, sea and land ports of entry. As technologies have evolved, facial comparison has proven to be one of the most effective solutions.
Following years of testing and pilots, CBP has successfully operationalized and deployed facial biometric comparison technology, known as the Traveler Verification Service (TVS), to support comprehensive biometric entry and exit procedures in the air, land, and sea environments.
The process works like this:
When the traveler presents him or herself for entry, or for exit, the traveler will encounter a camera connected to CBP’s cloud-based TVS facial matching service via a secure, encrypted connection.
This camera matches live images with existing photo templates from passenger travel documents.
Once the camera captures a quality image and the system successfully matches it with historical photo templates of all travelers from the gallery associated with that manifest, the traveler proceeds to inspection for admissibility by a CBP Officer or exits the United States.
Protecting our nation, one face at a time
EFFICIENCY MEETS MORE SECURITY
At CBP, we are constantly evolving to meet the security needs of our nation. Biometric Facial Comparison Technology is just one of the many ways we are protecting our borders while delivering a safer, more efficient travel experience. Facial biometrics adds an extra layer of security and further enhances the traveler experience by utilizing a more touch-free technology that streamlines entry procedures.
""CBP is excited to expand the use of facial biometrics through public/private partnerships to further secure and enhance travel while protecting the privacy of all travelers.""
  — Diane J. Sabatino, Acting Executive Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection
What travelers say about CBP Biometrics
And that is a fantastic invention to be able to do that, to be able to come into America and to go straight through with the facial to come in through the customs. As far as I’m concerned, the more the better, the better security that we can put universal, the better it can be for all of us.

Safety & Security of U.S. Borders: Biometrics
Overview
The United States is committed to “secure borders, open doors,” by welcoming and facilitating legitimate travel to the United States by international visitors while maintaining the integrity and security of our borders and our nation. The U.S. continues to work to ensure that access to our country is not impeded for legitimate international travelers.
Legal Requirements
In the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, the U.S. Congress mandated the use of biometrics in U.S. visas. This law requires that U.S. Embassies and Consulates abroad must issue to international visitors, ""only machine-readable, tamper-resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use biometric identifiers. Additionally, the Homeland Security Council decided that the U.S. standard for biometric screening is ten fingerprint scans collected at all U.S. Embassies and Consulates for visa applicants seeking to come to the United States.
What is a Biometric?
A biometric or biometric identifier is an objective measurement of a physical characteristic of an individual which, when captured in a database, can be used to verify the identity or check against other entries in the database. The best known biometric is the fingerprint, but others include facial recognition and iris scans.
Making Us Safer - International Visitors
The use of these identifiers is an important link in U.S. national security, because fingerprints taken will be compared with similarly collected fingerprints at U.S. ports-of-entry. This will verify identity to reduce use of stolen and counterfeit visas, and protect against possible use by terrorists or others who might represent a security risk to the United States. These two important programs (collecting fingerprints for visa issuance and verifying travelers’ fingerprints when they enter the United States) will make travel to the United States safer for legitimate travelers, and also improve safety and national security for all Americans. This transition to ten prints will enable the Departments of State and Homeland Security to more effectively process visa applicant fingerprints.
What This Means - Traveling to the United States
For U.S. Visas the chosen biometric identifier method is a digital photo and electronic fingerprints. All fingers of a visa applicant are electronically scanned in a quick, inkless process during the consular officer's interview with the applicant.
Travel without a Visa - Visa Waiver Program - Each traveler holding a valid passport from any of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries, regardless of age or passport used, must present an individual machine-readable passport (MRP) in order to enter the United States without a visa. Depending on the date the traveler's passport was issued, other passport requirements apply. If a prospective traveler does not meet requirements to travel without a visa, he/she will need to apply for a U.S. visa, and cannot travel on VWP. See Visa Waiver Program and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) website for complete details. Additionally, all VWP travelers are required to have an approved Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) before traveling to the United States.
Admission into the United States - Select travel procedures and biometrics to learn more about the Department of Homeland Security’s program at U.S. ports-of-entry, which verifies the identity of the traveler using the electronic fingerprint data and digital photographs.
Applicant Refusal to be Fingerprinted at Visa Interview
A visa applicant who refuses to be fingerprinted would have his or her visa application denied on the basis that it is incomplete. However, an applicant who then later decided to provide fingerprints would have his or her visa application re-considered without prejudice.
About the Information Collected
The electronic data from the ten fingerprints is stored in a database and is made available at U.S. ports-of-entry to Department of Homeland Security immigration inspectors. The electronic fingerprint data is associated with an issued visa for verification and the privacy of the data is protected by storage in the database.
The U.S. Department of State makes data available in accordance with the law governing the use of visa records, to U.S. law enforcement agencies that require the information for law enforcement purposes. Visa records are, by law, confidential. Requests for access to visa records by law enforcement are subject to statutory, regulatory and other legal restrictions.

This proceeding was initiated by an unfair labor practice charge filed on December 27, 2001, by the National Treasury Employees Union (herein called the Union or NTEU). The Complaint alleged that the Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, Washington, D.C. (herein called Customs Service or Respondent)1981713574 violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (herein called the Statute) by implementing a change in the policy concerning in-stream/midstream boardings of vessels without providing the Union with prior notice and an opportunity to bargain. More precisely, the complaint alleges that the Respondent amended its National Vessel Entry and Boarding Policy by requiring authorization prior to conducting in-stream/midstream boardings and limiting such boardings to extraordinary circumstances.
A hearing was held in the captioned matter in Washington, D.C. All parties were afforded the full opportunity to be heard, to examine and cross-examine witnesses, and to introduce evidence bearing on the issues involved herein. The Respondent and the General Counsel submitted post hearing briefs which have been fully considered.1314014624
Findings of Fact
The Union holds exclusive recognition for a nationwide bargaining unit consisting of some professional and all non-professional employees of the U.S. Customs Service. That bargaining unit includes approximately 7,000 Customs inspectors. A collective bargaining agreement covering that unit expired in 1999; however, the parties continue to operate under it as ""an expired agreement.""
Customs inspectors are responsible for enforcing various laws relating to entry into the United States. Such entry can occur at airports, seaports and land border crossings. Entry procedures at seaports can include Customs inspectors going on board vessels that are entering the United States in order to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations enforced by Customs.36541497 Among other things, boarding involves reviewing, verifying and completing documents and declarations; interviewing the vessel crew; and scrutinizing the condition of the vessel, crew and any passengers. Boarding is, however, not synonymous with search of the vessel; Customs can conduct a boarding without conducting a search.1638225643
Boardings can take place at dockside or in-stream. A dockside boarding, as its name suggests, involves a Customs inspector going on board a vessel that is docked. The terms ""in-stream,"" ""midstream,"" and ""anchor"" boarding are used synonymously to refer to an operation in which a Customs inspector boards a vessel that is not docked but is reached by and boarded from a launch, water-taxi or other water transport. In an in-stream boarding, the vessel is boarded from the ferrying craft by using either a gangway or Jacob's ladder.
Prior to 1993, Customs inspectors boarded almost every vessel entering the United States. Testimony revealed that although Customs maintains records of the number of boardings conducted each year, those records do not differentiate between in-stream boardings and dockside boardings. From anecdotal evidence provided by witnesses at the hearing, it emerged that the number of in-stream boardings and, for that matter, all boardings have decreased during the last 10 to 15 years. Statistics for each Fiscal Year (FY) during the period 1999 through 2002 submitted during the hearing confirmed that the number of all boardings steadily dropped.1297069131
Several factors were cited as responsible for the decrease in boardings. One factor cited was Customs Directive Number 5290-006, which was issued September 24, 1991. That directive, which was for the self-described purpose of ensuring that inspection activities were performed in a safe manner, provided that ""in-stream boarding of vessels will NOT be done as a matter of course."" [Emphasis in original.] (Jt. Exh. 2.) This instruction was reiterated in a memorandum to all Port Directors dated October 2, 1998. What emerged, however, as the major factor in reducing the number of boardings was the passage of the ""Customs Modernization Act"" in 1993,540984439 which changed previous requirements regarding boarding. The Customs Modernization Act required that Customs board only a ""sufficient number of vessels to ensure compliance with the laws it enforces"" and, thus, afforded Customs more discretion with respect to the decision of whether to board a vessel. 19 U.S.C. § 1934(b).
In February 2000, Customs issued Customs Directive No. 3120-016, ""National Vessel Entry and Boarding Policy."" (G.C. Exh. 1; Jt. Exh. 5.) That directive was issued as a result of a joint analysis performed by Customs Service and NTEU in response to the changes in boarding requirements contained in the Customs Modernization Act. That directive noted that vessel boardings were no longer required for all arriving commercial vessels and identified four separate categories in which inspectors would continue to board vessels. The first, enforcement boardings, would occur when a vessel was selected by Anti-Smuggling Units/Contraband Enforcement Teams and others for narcotics or other enforcement operations. The second, compliance measurement boardings, would occur when a vessel was randomly selected for the purpose of measuring compliance with vessel documentation and procedural requirements enforced by the Customs Service. The third, marine targeted boardings, would occur when a vessel was selected based on an analysis of arriving vessels against criteria used to identify which ones were most likely to have discrepancies relating to or violations of Customs regulations and policies. The fourth, service to industry boardings, would occur when a vessel representative requested that a Customs inspector go on board to perform entry procedures in lieu of the vessel agent reporting to the Customs house. A request for a service to industry boarding would be granted only if Customs' resources permitted.
All four categories of boardings can take place either in a dockside or in-stream location and at times that fall within or outside of the regular working hours of Customs inspectors.
More recently, as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the emphasis in Customs' border operations shifted from interdicting and seizing contraband, such as narcotics, to efforts focused on security and preventing terrorist actions. According to witnesses, this has produced an increased emphasis in seaport operations on inspecting containers and further contributed to reducing the number of boardings. This reduction is in large measure because container inspection requires use of processes different from those historically associated with boarding a vessel. Containers were described as resembling the trailer on the back of a semi. While on board a vessel, containers are stacked four to six high with stacks grouped together and tethered down. Their size and placement prevents effective search while they are on a vessel. Rather, they must be unloaded from the vessel and examined either by using an x-ray process or taking them to a warehouse where contents can be removed for inspection. Both of these inspection processes are conducted by Customs inspectors who operate the equipment associated with the x-ray process or conduct the inspections that occur in warehouses. In container examinations, as contrasted with boardings, the Customs inspectors interact with stevedores and warehouse personnel rather than vessel crews.
The event that is the focus of the complaint in this case occurred on or about October 22, 2001, when Customs Service issued Customs Directive 3120-16A, ""National Vessel Entry and Boarding Policy."" (Jt. Exh. 6) The only difference between this directive and the directive of the same title that was issued in February 2000, was the addition of a provision that Customs officers would not board any vessel in-stream/midstream unless the Directors, Field Operations, Customs Management Centers, authorized an in-stream/midstream boarding for extraordinary reasons.1415853217
Customs Service did not provide advance notice to the Union before issuing the October 2001 Directive. Rather, it provided informational notification by letter dated October 30, 2001. By letter dated November 5, 2001, the Union requested bargaining and that implementation be stayed pending completion of bargaining. Customs Service responded and rejected the Union's request that implementation be held in abeyance but expressed willingness to re-open the National Vessel Boarding Policy. In its response, Customs Service asserted that the directive reflected long-standing policy and had no impact on the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees other than to increase workplace safety.
Kimberly Nott, who is the Chief of the Manifest and Conveyance Branch of Customs Service and was involved in drafting the 2001 Directive, testified that the concern driving issuance of that directive was employee safety. Nott stated that the earlier instructions that in-stream boardings not be done as a matter of course were not being enforced in a sufficiently strict manner and Customs headquarters issued the 2001 Directive to bring more uniformity to the practice. In her testimony, Nott acknowledged that the ""extraordinary reasons"" language is different from the ""not as a matter of course"" language and would probably induce fewer in-stream boardings.
Anecdotal evidence submitted at the hearing in this case confirms that there have been very few in-stream boardings subsequent to the 2001 Directive.
Witnesses testifying for the General Counsel at the hearing identified two principle concerns about the reduction of in-stream boardings. The first involved potential reduction in overtime. The second involved reduction in job satisfaction and skills associated with in-stream boarding.
Evidence submitted demonstrates that one of the principle objectives in assigning inspection overtime is to equalize opportunity for overtime earnings. To accomplish this, an overtime roster is maintained in which employees in each overtime pool are listed in order of the amount of overtime dollars that they have earned so far during the earnings year. As an overtime opportunity arises, absent other relevant considerations, it is offered to the lowest earners first. Individual overtime earnings are capped at $30,000 per year; however, a waiver may be obtained to exceed the cap.346779986 Also, up to $15,000 in annual overtime earnings may be counted toward an inspector's income for the purpose of computing his/her annuity. Witnesses testified that some inspectors tend to be consistently among the high earners while others are consistently among the low earners. Witnesses attributed this largely to the personal preferences of the inspectors with respect to their willingness to work overtime. Testimony from supervisory personnel indicated that the need to ""draft"" inspectors to work overtime in the absence of volunteers was not uncommon.
Many ports of entry that have a seaport also include an airport that handles international flights and, thus, conduct inspection operations at both the seaport and airport. While all inspectors who are normally assigned to the seaport are qualified to perform inspection duties at the airport, the reverse is not as common. What is important to the dispute in this case is that Customs inspectors normally assigned to seaport operations may earn overtime performing inspection activities at the airport.
Although exact figures were not available, it is undisputed that, historically, some but not all of the in-stream boardings were conducted on overtime. Some Customs inspectors appearing as witnesses for the General Counsel testified that a significant amount of their overtime earnings came from in-stream boardings. Those witnesses, who normally worked the seaport, generally expressed a preference for earning overtime in seaport operations rather than airport operations. Although the hourly overtime compensation rates were the same, those witnesses testified that they preferred the type of work performed at the seaport to that performed at the airport. One, Jack Russo, testified that his normal duties were incompatible with working overtime at the airport during the week and that his ability to do so would be limited with rare exceptions to weekends.1600627928
At the hearing, no evidence was submitted that showed that anyone's overtime earnings actually dropped subsequent to the issuance of the October 2001 Directive. The General Counsel's witnesses attributed this to an increase in overtime generated by post-September 11 activities. Those witnesses maintained that such activities were coming to an end and in the near future would no longer be a source of overtime opportunity. The Respondent's witnesses testified that any loss in overtime opportunities resulting from reductions in the number of in-stream boardings would be compensated for by opportunities flowing from other Customs' operations, such as at the airports or, in the port of New Orleans, increased emphasis on inspecting cruise ships. Significantly, one witness for the Respondent, Robert Dee Jones, testified that the decision to limit in-stream boardings would have no effect on the overtime budget of a port.
With respect to job satisfaction, the inspectors called as witnesses by the General Counsel expressed a clear preference for working in seaport operations, in general, and performing in-stream boardings, in particular. One, Christopher Gerst, stated that he did not find performing x-ray container examinations as satisfying as performing traditional boardings such as in-stream boardings. Also, the witnesses saw in-stream boardings as an opportunity to operate with a higher degree of independence and exercise more independent judgment than other types of boardings or inspections. The witnesses testified that they feared that their potential for making seizures, which they highly prized as a source of awards and promotion opportunities, would diminish with the reduction of in-stream boardings. Other witnesses testified, however, that seizures are neither unique to nor more common to in-stream boardings, but can occur during inspections done in other types of boardings, airport operations, and container examinations.
Inspectors testifying for the General Counsel also asserted that the drop in in-stream boardings resulted in a corresponding reduction in the frequency of the human interaction involved in that type of boarding. Although evidence shows that container examinations involve human interaction, it also showed that it is of a different nature than that involved in boardings. As acknowledged by Respondent's witness Robert Galloway, Customs inspectors conducting x-ray examination of containers are more likely to be interacting with stevedores and truck drivers about the logistics of handling containers and their contents rather than asking law enforcement questions of vessel crews.
As to the claims that severely curtailing in-stream boardings will result in loss of skills, the evidence shows that the only skills unique to in-stream boardings as contrasted with dockside boardings are the physical skills involved in boarding one craft from another craft rather than from a dock. At the hearing, Customs inspectors Argent Acosta and Christopher Gerst acknowledged that the job and basic skills required are much the same once on board whether the boarding is done in-stream or dockside.

Analysis and Conclusions
The Positions of the Parties
The General Counsel
The complaint alleged that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) by changing the practice with respect to in-stream/midstream boarding without affording the Union advance notice and an opportunity to bargain prior to implementation. The General Counsel maintains that for a lengthy period prior to October 2001, Customs inspectors had regularly boarded vessels in-stream/midstream and that this continued to occur despite the issuance of the 1991 Directive and 1998 reaffirmation of that directive. The General Counsel contends that Respondent's action in requiring authorization by the Director, Field Operations, and limiting such boardings to extraordinary reasons significantly curtailed in-stream/midstream boardings and effectively removed a duty from the job function of Customs inspectors. The General Counsel asserts that Respondent's action constituted a change in conditions of employment that had more than a de minimis effect on bargaining unit employee.
In support of its claim that the change was more than de minimis, the General Counsel asserts it is reasonably foreseeable that once the post-September 11 overtime opportunities end, Customs inspectors will have nothing to replace the major source of overtime opportunity that in-stream boardings afforded. The General Counsel maintains that, potentially, this loss will affect not only the annual income of inspectors but their retirement income as well. The General Counsel disputes the Respondent's claims that other sources will generate sufficient overtime opportunities to compensate for those lost through the curtailment of in-stream/midstream boarding. Furthermore, the General Counsel argues that the restriction of in-stream boarding also deprives Customs inspectors of a major source of job satisfaction and will cause the skill level needed for such boarding to diminish.
The General Counsel claims that Customs Service was obligated to maintain conditions of employment with respect to in-stream boarding notwithstanding the expiration of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, the General Counsel asserts that the subject of in-stream boarding is not covered by the parties' expired collective bargaining agreement.
As remedy, the General Counsel proposes that the an order be issued requiring post-implementation bargaining, full make-whole relief, and the posting of a notice to employees.
The Respondent
Respondent maintains that it has the ""right to implement safety rules and policies dealing with internal security, and it is not required to negotiate such rules substantively with the Charging Party."" Respondent's Brief at 37. With respect to the question of whether it had any obligation to negotiate over procedures and appropriate arrangements, Respondent argues that the Union has effectively waived any right that it may have had to bargain concerning the ""basic restrictions on in-stream/midstream boardings."" Id. at 37-38. In support of this claim, the Respondent contends that it initially imposed the restrictions on in-stream boarding in 1991 and that the 2001 Directive constitutes nothing more than a restatement of the earlier directive. The Respondent asserts that the Union failed to request bargaining in 1991 or during negotiations that occurred over boarding issues during the mid-1990's and, at this point, a bargaining request on the matter is no longer timely.
The Respondent insists that because the 2001 Directive restates a preexisting restriction on in-stream/midstream boarding, this case is distinguishable from United States Department of Agriculture, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 17 FLRA 281 (1985) (APHIS). The Respondent characterizes APHIS as involving the promulgation of a ""brand-new in-stream/midstream boarding policy"" rather than a ""preexisting"" one as is involved here. Respondent's Brief at 39, n.5. Thus, Respondent asserts that in any event the impact of the ""extraordinary circumstances"" requirement in the 2001 Directive was de minimis.
Respondent also contends that insofar as the 2001 Directive designated the Director, Field Operations, of each Customs Management Center as the individual responsible for authorizing in-stream/midstream boardings, it involved the exercise of several management rights. Specifically, Respondent cites the rights to: determine the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute; determine its mission, budget, and internal security under section 7106(a)(1); and direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2). The Respondent argues that in the past all boardings required management approval and merely elevating the permission level to a different manager does not materially change conditions of employment for bargaining unit employees.
Respondent submits that any claimed impact on overtime, morale and job skills should be rejected as purely speculative or attributable to causes other than the 2001 Directive. Respondent contends that evidence shows that overtime opportunities are likely to continue at or above levels in existence before the promulgation of the 2001 Directive. Respondent also asserts that overall boardings were decreasing prior to the 2001 Directive and any effect on morale flowing from the reduced number of boardings cannot fairly be attributed to that particular directive. With respect to claims that the directive will result in a degradation of skills, the Respondent contends there are no skills of any consequence that are unique to in-stream/midstream boardings as contrasted with dockside boardings.
Respondent asserts that because the parties have already negotiated overtime issues in their collective bargaining agreement, the matter is covered by the agreement and, consequently, the Union's overtime concerns are not subject to further bargaining.
Respondent maintains that a back pay remedy is unwarranted because there is no direct causal relationship shown between the absence of impact and implementation bargaining with respect to the 2001 Directive and any loss of pay or benefits bargaining unit employees may have suffered. Respondent argues that any such overtime assignments are dependent on a multitude of factors unrelated to the directive and there is no evidence of any loss in overtime that was directly attributable to that directive.
Analysis
Prior to implementing a change in conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees, an agency generally is required to provide the exclusive representative with notice and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain. See, e.g., Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Bastrop, Texas, 55 FLRA 848, 852 (1999) (FCI, Bastrop). With limited exceptions, parties must satisfy their mutual obligation to bargain before changes in conditions of employment are implemented. See, e.g., id. The extent to which an agency is required to bargain over changes in conditions of employment depends on the nature of the change. See, e.g., id. Where an agency institutes a change in a condition of employment and the actual decision, or substance of the change, is negotiable, the extent of impact on unit employees is not relevant to whether the agency is obligated to bargain. See, e.g., 92 Bomb Wing, Fairchild Air Force Base, Spokane, Washington, 50 FLRA 701 (1995). Where, however, a change in a condition of employment entails the exercise of a management right under section 7106 of the Statute, the agency has a statutory obligation to bargain concerning the impact and implementation of such change but only if the change would result in an impact on employees that is more than de minimis in nature. See, e.g., id.
In this case, the Respondent argues that the alleged change involved the exercise of several management rights. During opening argument at the hearing in this case, the General Counsel conceded that the decision on whether to board vessels either in-stream or dockside is a management right. (Tr. 17-18.) Moreover, the General Counsel's argument that the de minimis principle applies in this case further demonstrates acknowledgment that the alleged change involved the exercise of management rights. I find it is not in dispute that the Respondent's action permitting in-stream/midstream boardings only where extraordinary reasons exist and designating the Director, Field Operations, as the official responsible for authorizing such boardings involved the exercise of management rights.1635432578 The questions whether that action (1) constituted a change in conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees that (2) was greater than de minimis remain.
Respondent's action constituted a change in conditions of employment
Based on the instant record, I find that the number of boardings overall was in decline prior to the issuance of the October 2001 Directive. The major factor producing this decline was the Customs Modernization Act. A contributing factor with respect to the decline of in-stream/midstream boardings in particular may have been the provision in the 1991 Directive that such boardings would not be done as a matter of course. Put another way, that directive provided that in-stream boardings were not to occur as a common practice. I find that the 2001 Directive, however, imposed an even more restrictive practice with respect to in-stream boarding of vessels; specifically, in-stream boardings would not occur unless extraordinary reasons warranted them. I also find that this shift from the language used in the 1991 Directive communicated an increase in the degree to which in-stream boardings were discouraged.
It was the foreseeable and likely effect of the more stringent language used in the 2001 Directive that in-stream boardings would be less likely to happen than before. That this indeed came to pass is confirmed by anecdotal evidence showing that after the directive issued, very few in-stream/midstream boardings have taken place.
Respondent's attempt to distinguish this case from APHIS is, in my opinion, unpersuasive. The critical point to be taken from APHIS is not whether the in-stream/midstream boarding policy was brand new but whether it constituted a change in conditions of employment. Here, the Respondent's action imposing further limitations than previously practiced on the extent to which in-stream/midstream boardings would occur, amounted to a change in conditions of employment.
Even though dockside boardings remained as a job function and were unaffected by the 2001 Directive, the curtailment of in-stream/midstream boardings constituted a change. Although many features of in-stream/midstream boardings and dockside boardings are the same, some are different. Clearly, the methods of reaching the vessel to be boarded are different. The testimony that in-stream/midstream boardings afford the Customs inspectors conducting the boardings the potential for more independence in carrying out their responsibilities is persuasive. This potential for independence appears to be largely a consequence of the fact that vessels are less accessible when in-stream/midstream and, consequently, supervisory support and scrutiny are diluted. Beyond that, it appears from the record that job duties and skills required are pretty much the same in both types of boardings. Thus, although in many respects matters relating to the job functions of Customs inspectors remained the same, in other respects they changed as a consequence of the loss of features associated with in-stream/midstream boarding.
The effect of the change on bargaining unit employees was de minimis
In determining whether the effect of a change in conditions of employment is more than de minimis, the Authority looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment. See, e.g., U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, 56 FLRA 906, 913 (2000).
The instant record, in my view, fails to show that employees suffered or are likely to suffer any loss of opportunity to earn overtime at levels that occurred prior to the issuance of the 2001 Directive. To begin with, evidence was inconclusive with respect to how much overtime employees actually earned from in-stream/midstream boarding before and after the 2001 Directive and how much of any decline in those earnings was attributable to that directive. It is clear that not all in-stream/midstream boardings occurred on overtime and that record keeping did not differentiate between in-stream/midstream boardings and other sources of overtime earnings such as dockside boardings. It is also clear that factors in addition to the 2001 Directive operated to reduce the number of in-stream/midstream boardings in recent years. The record reveals that both prior to and subsequent to the 2001 Directive, there have been other sources of overtime and that overtime assignments are not always staffed by volunteers. The evidence supports a finding that it is reasonably foreseeable that notwithstanding the ebb in overtime opportunities attributable to post-September 11 operations and to in-stream/midstream boardings, other sources of overtime will continue to provide ample opportunity to employees wishing to earn compensation at the same level as they did prior to October 2001. In this regard, evidence shows that there continues to be ample opportunity for Customs inspectors to work overtime in conjunction with airport operations, cruise ship operations, container examinations, etc. Moreover, there is no anticipated drop in amounts budgeted for overtime. In sum, I do not find that it is reasonably foreseeable that the October 2001 Directive will result in a drop in the amount of overtime compensation available to employees.
There is certainly evidence showing that some employees find in-stream/midstream boarding more desirable than other duties and, hence, preferable as a source of overtime earnings. However, this appears to be largely a matter of personal preference. That is, some employee witnesses expressed a preference for functioning in what they perceive as a more traditional law-enforcement role; some expressed a preference for working in a seaport environment; some expressed a preference for the greater degree of independence that they perceived in-stream/midstream boardings afforded them. In determining whether the 2001 Directive has produced an impact that is greater than de minimis, it is significant that although those employees may need to engage in duties that they perceive as less preferable, it is clear they will still have the opportunity to earn overtime at levels comparable to what they did prior to October 2001. It is also significant that the decrease in the in-stream/midstream duties, which they find preferable, is not entirely attributable to the 2001 Directive.
The General Counsel maintains that reducing in-stream/midstream boarding deprives these employees of experience that will build their skills. Based on the record, the only skills apparent that are unique to in-stream/midstream boardings are using a Jacob's ladder or gangway to board one vessel from another. There was neither claim nor evidence that mastery of such skills affords any benefits or rewards such as compensation, promotion or advancement potential. Rather, the only apparent benefit of possessing well-developed skills in using Jacob's ladders and gangways during in-stream boardings is to reduce the potential for accidents while engaging in that activity. Although practice may increase skills that will decrease the likelihood of mishaps, limiting the use Jacob's ladders and gangways also limits the occasions for accidents to happen while using them. In my view, insofar as reducing the potential for accidents is concerned, cutting down on the number of in-stream boardings offsets any diminished opportunity to increase skill in using Jacob's ladders and gangways through experience. Accordingly, it is found that the loss of opportunity to use Jacob's ladders and gangways in in-stream boardings has minimal, if any, effect on the conditions of employment of Customs inspectors.
I conclude that the effect of limitations placed on in-stream/midstream boardings centered almost exclusively on individual personal preferences among the duties assigned to employees. Other than employees' personal preferences, the evidence does not reveal that the limitation had any real effect on their working conditions.
Because the effect of the change instituted in the October 2001 Directive was no more than de minimis, the Customs Service had no obligation to afford the Union notice and an opportunity to bargain and, therefore, I find did not violate section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute, as alleged.1643588245
Based on all of the above, it is recommended that the Authority adopt the following:

Subsequent to the hearing in this case, the General
Counsel submitted a motion pursuant to §§ 2423.23 and 2429.5 of the Federal Labor Relations Authority's Rules and Regulations that I take official notice of the organiza-tional and name change of Respondent. The motion, which is unopposed, is, hereby, granted. I take official notice that effective March 1, 2003, the name of the Respondent changed from U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service to Department of Homeland Security, Border and Transportation Security Directorate, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. The case caption has been changed to reflect the current name of the Respondent.
1314014624
Prior to the hearing in this case, Respondent filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that there were not material facts in dispute. I denied that motion at the outset of the hearing. In its post-hearing brief, Respondent ""reiterates the arguments in its Motion for Summary Judgment"" that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. To the extent that Respondent has renewed its motion for summary judgment, I deny the motion. I find that there are facts in dispute. In particular, the parties dispute whether by a directive issued in October 2001 Respondent changed its policy with respect to in-stream/midstream boarding and, if so, the extent of the impact on bargaining unit employees.

A vessel's entry at a Customs port can also be accomplished by a vessel agent bringing necessary documents to the Customs house for processing rather than a Customs inspector going on board the vessel.
1638225643
Where a search is not initially planned but a Customs inspector sees something suspicious while conducting a boarding, he or she can recommend or request that additional inspectors be sent in and a ship search be conducted. Such searches may result in seizures of contraband.

The figures for total boardings were: FY 1999--45,358; FY 2000--37,629; FY 2001--23,115; and FY 2002--18,979. In FY 2000 compared to FY 1999, total boardings dropped 17%; in FY 2001 compared to FY 2000, total boardings dropped 39%; and in FY 2002 compared to 2001, total boardings dropped 18%. One witness estimated that in the port of New Orleans, Customs boarded over 90% of arriving vessels prior to the ""Customs Modernization Act,"" which was enacted and signed into law in 1993. The witness testified that, by comparison, this figure was approximately 70-72% in FY 1995; 37% in FY 2000; 28% in FY 2001; and 16% in FY 2002.
540984439
At the trial in this case, the witnesses and documents submitted used the terms ""Customs Modernization Act"" or the ""Mod Act."" It appears that the statutory provision to which they were referring is actually Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. No. 103-182, which is entitled ""Customs Modernization."" In this decision, I will use the term Customs Modernization Act.

In relevant part, the directive stated:
7 INSTREAM/MID-STREAM BOARDINGS.
7.1 Customs officers will not board any vessel instream/mid-stream, including those at anchorage. Only for extraordinary reasons may the Directors, Field Operations, Customs Management Centers, authorize an instream/mid-stream boarding. It is then the Boarding Officer's responsibility to determine if conditions on site allow for a safe boarding. Safety of the Customs Inspector is paramount to all other concerns while performing an instream/mid-stream boarding.

Historically, such waivers were rarely granted. An exception occurred during FY 2002 when approximately 392 waivers were granted. This large number was unprecedented and was attributed to activities generated by the events of September 11, 2001.

Although I am not convinced that all of the management rights cited by the Respondent are implicated, some of them no doubt are. Accordingly, I find that it is unnecessary to the disposition of this complaint to determine which particular management rights actually are involved.

In view of this finding, it is not necessary to address the arguments that the Union waived bargaining rights with respect to in-stream/midstream boarding and that the matter is covered by the parties' collective bargaining agreement.

The Department of Homeland Security Seal
The Department of Homeland Security seal was created in June 2003 and is symbolic of the Department's mission - to prevent attacks and protect Americans - on the land, in the sea and in the air.
In the center of the seal, a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field. The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words ""U.S. DEPARTMENT OF"" in the top half and ""HOMELAND SECURITY"" in the bottom half in a circular placement.
The eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows.
Centered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland - air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department. The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky. The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines.

Border Security: Immigration Issues
in the 108th Congress
Summary
Enhancing border security has emerged as a significant policy issue after the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Prior to the terrorist attacks, the priorities for
border security policy were beginning to shift from immigration-related issues to
issues related to facilitating legitimate cross-border commerce. Several bills have
been introduced in the 108th Congress (S. 539/H.R. 1096 and S. 6) that would
authorize funding for increased personnel and technological improvements. S.
539/H.R. 1096 would require ongoing training for immigration personnel on how to
use the new technology, an update of a port infrastructure assessment study, and
demonstration projects on new technology at ports of entry, among other things.
Another piece of legislation (H.R. 853) would establish a northern border coordinator
within the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security in the Department of
Homeland Security, among other things. The northern border coordinator would
serve as a liaison to the Canadian government on border security-related issues.
Although the 107th Congress enacted several pieces of legislation that dealt with
enhancing immigration-related border security, legislation to strengthen the nation’s
borders had been enacted as early as the 104th Congress. The Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA; P.L. 104-208) contained
several immigration-related border security provisions that addressed illegal
immigration and the smuggling of humans into the United States through the
southwest border. IIRIRA also contained a provision that required the electronic
tracking of every alien arriving in and departing from the United States. The
deadline for implementing the electronic tracking system, commonly referred to as
the entry and exit data system, was moved back in subsequent legislation. The
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, however, prompted Congress to speed up
implementation of the entry and exit data system as well as enact new provisions
aimed at enhancing border security.
In the months following the terrorist attacks, Congress passed several pieces of
legislation intended to enhance border security such as the USA PATRIOT Act (P.L.
107-56) and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 (P.L.
107-173). In addition to legislation aimed at enhancing border security, the 107th
Congress also enacted legislation that created a department specifically for securing
the homeland. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) consolidates
several agencies responsible for border security, including INS’ enforcement
functions, into a new Department of Homeland Security.
This report provides background information on the main immigration-related
border security issues that have been raised as a result of the terrorist attacks and
resulting concern for homeland security. It describes enacted legislation in the 107th
Congress as well as in previous Congresses that focus on immigration-related border
security issues. The report also poses possible immigration-related border security
issues the 108th Congress may consider. This report will be updated to reflect any
additional related legislation in the 108th Congress, as well as implementation issues.

Introduction
Enhancing border security has emerged as a significant policy issue after the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Several pieces of legislation were enacted in
the 107th Congress that enhanced border security such as the USA PATRIOT Act
(P.L. 107-56) and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002
(P.L. 107-173). The 108th Congress may address several issues pertaining to border
security that may include authorizing funding to increase personnel and improving
infrastructure and technology at the border and ports of entry.
In addition to enacted legislation aimed at enhancing border security, the 107th
Congress enacted legislation that created a department specifically for securing the
homeland. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) consolidated some
border security agencies, including the border patrol and inspections activities of the
former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), into a newly created
Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Along with the border patrol and
immigration inspection activities, the Act also transferred INS’ interior investigations
and detention and removal activities to the new DHS.1 The border patrol and
immigration inspection activities have traditionally focused on stemming illegal entry
into the country, while facilitating legitimate travel, and with the emphasis now on

Immigration Agencies and Functions, by Lisa M. Seghetti and Ruth Ellen Wasem.
CRS-2
homeland security it is unlikely that the focus will change. Some view the Act,
however, as indicative of a fundamental shift Congress has taken with respect to the
way in which it views immigration policy, in particular border security.
Prior to enactment of P.L. 107-296, efforts had been underway in the
Department of Justice (DOJ) to restructure the former INS. These efforts were
centered on splitting the two functions — immigrant service and immigration
enforcement (that included the border patrol and inspection activities) but keeping
them in the same agency.2 The Homeland Security Act of 2002, however, splits the
two functions and places the immigration enforcement function, including
immigration inspections and the border patrol, in a Bureau of Border Security under
a Directorate of Border and Transportation Security with other agencies that perform
similar functions. An Administration reorganization, however, placed the border
patrol and immigration inspections function, along with Customs inspections, into
a Bureau of Customs and Border Protection under a Directorate of Border and
Transportation Security; the immigration interior enforcement function, along with
Customs enforcement, is in a Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement
under the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security.
Background
There are two arms of the federal government charged with immigration related
border security: the border patrol and immigration inspectors.3 The United States
Border Patrol enforces immigration law as well as some aspects of the criminal law
along the border and between ports of entry. Immigration inspectors are stationed at
United States ports of entry and examine and verify U.S. citizens and foreign
nationals who seek admission to the United States.
Over the years the United States borders and land ports of entry have seen a rise
in aliens using fraudulent documents to gain entry into the United States. There has
also been an increase in aliens illegally crossing into the country, while lawful aliens
and residents of the United States have witnessed longer delays at land ports of entry.
Although there has been a longstanding concern to better track aliens coming into
and departing the country, some contend that the need for an automated tracking
system is more apparent, especially due to the potential for terrorists to sneak into the
country. The following issues have concerned lawmakers for years and have been
the subject of recent law, as discussed in the legislation section.
! the use of fraudulent documents,
! aliens illegally crossing into the United States,
! long delays at land ports of entry, and
! a need for an entry and exit data system.
2 See CRS Report RL31388, Immigration and Naturalization Service: Restructuring
Proposals in the 107th Congress, by Lisa M. Seghetti.
3 Border security, however, begins at the consular posts overseas with the issuance of visas.
CRS-3
Bi-National Cooperation

The United States and Canadian governments signed a declaration establishing
a “smart-border” on December 12, 2001. The declaration included a 30-point plan
to secure the border and facilitate the flow of low-risk travelers and goods through
the following:
! coordinated law enforcement operations;
! intelligence sharing;
! infrastructure improvements;
! the improvement of compatible immigration databases;
! visa policy coordination;
! common biometric identifiers in certain documentation;
! prescreening of air passengers;
! joint passenger analysis units; and
! improved processing of refugee and asylum claims, among other
things.
Previously, on December 3, 2001 the two countries signed a joint statement of
cooperation on border security and migration that focused on detection and
prosecution of security threats, the disruption of illegal migration, and the efficient
management of legitimate travel.4
With respect to the southwest border, in March 2002 the United States and
Mexico announced a partnership to create a new, technologically advanced border
to assure tighter security while facilitating legitimate travel. The U.S.-Mexico Border
Partnership Action Plan calls for greater cooperation between the two governments
in order to better secure border infrastructure and facilitate the flow of people and
goods between the countries. The plan also calls for the development of integrated
computer databases between the two countries and express lanes at high volume ports
of entry for frequent, pre-cleared low-risk travelers.5
Legislation Enacted in Previous Congresses
Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of
1996 (IIRIRA). Congress began addressing the need for greater border security in
the 104th Congress when it passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA; Division C of the Omnibus Consolidated
Appropriations Act for FY1997; P.L 104-208).6 IIRIRA’s border security provisions

Security: U.S.-Canada Border Issues, by Lisa M. Seghetti.
5 See [http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/usmxborder/22points.html].
6 Prior to the enactment of IIRIRA, Congress, in Title XIII, §13006 of the Violent Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-322), authorized appropriations for
FY1995-FY1998 to increase the resources for INS’ border patrol, inspections and
deportation programs with respect to apprehending illegal aliens. The Act also authorized

were concentrated at the southwest border and increased border enforcement by
authorizing the hiring of 1,000 new border patrol agents each year for FY1997
through FY2001. The Act called for the deployment of additional border patrol
agents to areas that were in proportion to the level of illegal crossings. The Act also
required an increase in border patrol support personnel by 300 a year for FY1997
through FY2001.
IIRIRA sought to facilitate legitimate travel to the United States by addressing
the long delays at the ports of entry by authorizing the hiring of inspectors to a level
adequate to assure full staffing during peak crossing hours for FY1997 and FY1998.
The Act also authorized the Attorney General to establish six inspection projects
wherein a fee can be charged. Under the Act, the projects could be dedicated
commuter lanes at ports of entry that would facilitate the speedy passage of frequent
border crossers.7 IIRIRA also established six preinspection stations at foreign
airports.
In an effort to stem illegal immigration, IIRIRA authorized the expansion of
border barriers and authorized the Attorney General to acquire and use any federal
equipment that was available for transfer in order to detect, interdict and reduce
illegal immigration into the United States. It also authorized appropriations to
expand the Automated Biometric Fingerprint Identification System (commonly
referred to as IDENT) nationwide to include the fingerprints of illegal or criminal
aliens who were apprehended.
IIRIRA amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by requiring border
crossing cards to have a biometric identifier that is machine readable. The Act
required that the biometric identifier must match the biometric characteristic of the
card holder in order for the alien to enter the United States.
In addition to the immigration-related border security provisions, IIRIRA had
a number of reporting requirements that pertained to border security including
requirements that: (1) the Comptroller General track, monitor and evaluate the
Attorney General’s strategy to deter illegal immigration and report to Congress
annually until 2003; (2) the Attorney General report to Congress on the joint
initiative to develop a plan with respect to transitioning to an automated data
collection system at ports of entry; and (3) the Attorney General report to Congress
on a final plan to redeploy border patrol personnel from interior locations in the
country to the border areas.
Automated Entry/Exit System (US-VISIT). Section 110 of IIRIRA
required the Attorney General to develop an automated data system to record the
entry and exit of every alien arriving in and departing from the United States by
September 30, 1998. Many expressed concern about the potential for such a system

appropriations to increase the number of border patrol agents by not less than 1,000 per year
for FY1995-FY1998.

Accelerated Service System, by Lisa M. Seghetti.
CRS-5
to cause long delays at ports of entry. Consequently, Congress amended §110 of
IIRIRA in the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-277) by
extending the deadline for the implementation of an automated entry and exit data
system and by prohibiting significant disruption of trade, tourism, or other legitimate
cross-border traffic once the data system was in place. And in June 2000, Congress
further amended §110 in the INS Data Management and Improvement Act of 2000
(P.L. 106-215) by delaying the immediate implementation of the automated entry and
exit data system at all ports of entry and requiring the development of a data system
that uses available data to record alien arrivals and departures, without establishing
additional documentary requirements. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks, however, Congress requested that resources be directed to the immediate
development and implementation of an automated entry and exit control system at
all ports of entry.
On May 19, 2003, Asa Hutchinson, Under Secretary of the Border and
Transportation Security Division in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
announced the Administration’s intent to implement the United States Visitor and
Immigration Status Indicator Technology (U.S.-VISIT) program, which was
previously referred to as the automated entry/exit system. According to the Under
Secretary, DHS expects to meet the deadline for implementing the US-VISIT
program at the nation’s airports and seaports. The deadlines for implement the US-
VISIT program at high-traffic land ports of entry is December 31, 2004 and for all
other ports of entry, December 31, 2005.8
Legislation Enacted in the 107th Congress
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools
Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act)
of 2001 (P.L. 107-56). The USA PATRIOT Act advances a requirement set forth
in IIRIRA and a subsequent Act9 by stating that it is the sense of Congress that the
implementation of an integrated entry and exit data system be expedited, and that the
Entry and Exit Data System Task Force be immediately established.10 With respect
to the entry and exit data system, the Act requires it to interface with federal law
enforcement systems and authorizes appropriations to fully implement the system.
The Act requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, through the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop and certify a
technology standard that can be used to verify the identity of persons seeking a visa
8 See P.L. 106-215.
9 Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000 (P.L.
106-215).
10 The Entry and Exit Data System Task Force is charged with evaluating how the Attorney
General can efficiently and effectively implement the entry and exit data system. It is also
charged with evaluating how the United States can improve the flow of traffic at its ports
of entry through cooperation between the public and private sectors as well as among other
agencies; enhance systems for data collection and data sharing; and modify different
information technology systems. The task force is also required to evaluate the cost of
implementing each of its recommendations.
CRS-6
to enter the United States.11 With respect to developing and certifying a technology
standard, the Act also requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to
consult with the Secretary of Treasury and other federal law enforcement and
intelligence agencies that the Attorney General or the Secretary of State (in
consultation with Congress) deems appropriate. It requires the technology standard
that is developed be a “cross-agency, cross-platform electronic system” that is fully
integrated with other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ databases.
It also requires the technology standard to be accessible to all consular officers who
are responsible for issuing visas; all federal inspection agents at U.S. ports of entry;
and all law enforcement and intelligence officers who are determined by regulations
to be responsible for investigating or identifying aliens admitted to the United States
through a visa.
The Act authorizes appropriations to triple the number of border patrol agents
and immigration inspectors at the northern border. The Act also authorizes $50
million in appropriations to INS to improve technology for monitoring the northern
border. In an effort to prevent terrorists from entering the United States, the Act
authorizes the Secretary of State to share visa and lookout data with foreign
governments. It requires the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI to share
data from domestic criminal record databases with the Secretary of State for the
purpose of adjudicating visa applications.
In addition to the immigration-related border security provisions, the USA
PATRIOT Act has a reporting requirement that mandates the Attorney General and
the Secretary of State, jointly in consultation with the Secretary of Treasury, to
submit a report to Congress that describes the development, implementation, efficacy
and privacy implications of the technology standard and database system.12 The Act
also requires the Attorney General to report to Congress on the feasibility of
enhancing the FBI’s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS)
and other identification systems used for identifying individuals in an effort to better
identify foreign nationals who may be seeking entry into the United States and are
wanted in connection with a criminal investigation in the United States or abroad.13
The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002
(P.L. 107-173). The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002
further advances requirements set forth in IIRIRA by requiring the Attorney General
to implement an integrated entry and exit data system. In developing the entry and
exit data system, the Act requires that a technology standard be funded and
implemented. The Act also requires the entry and exit data system to be
interoperable with other databases with respect to making alien admissibility
determinations. With respect to border crossing cards, the Act extended until
September 30, 2002 the deadline for border crossing identification cards to contain
11 Such as a biometric identifier that is unique to the individual.
12 The Act set an April 26, 2003 (18 months after enactment) deadline, and every 2 years
thereafter, for the report to be submitted to Congress. P.L. 107-173, however, amended the
USA PATRIOT Act by setting an Oct. 26, 2002 (1 year after enactment) deadline.
13 The Act authorizes appropriations to enhance IAFIS and other identification systems.
CRS-7
a biometric identifier that matches the biometric characteristic of the card holder.14
The Act authorizes appropriations to develop and implement the entry and exit
system.
The Act requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to issue
machine-readable, tamper-resistant visas and travel documents that have biometric
identifiers by October 26, 2004. It also requires the installation of biometric
identifier readers and scanners at all ports of entry by October 26, 2004. The Act
requires that the biometric data readers and scanners be accurate according to
domestic and international standards and that they be able to authenticate documents.
The Act authorizes appropriations to deploy the necessary equipment at the ports of
entry to read and scan the new travel documents.
The Act requires the Attorney General to increase the number of INS inspectors
and support staff, and INS investigators and support staff by 200 per group over the
number that was authorized in P.L. 107-56 for each fiscal year from FY2002 through
FY2006. The Act authorizes appropriations for DOJ to increase the annual rate of
basic pay for journeyman border patrol agents, INS inspectors, inspections assistants
and support staff.15 It also authorizes appropriations for personnel training and
increased resources for INS and Consular Affairs. The Act expands the Carrier
Consultant Program by assigning additional immigration officers to assist air carriers
in detecting fraudulent documents at foreign airports.
With respect to technological and infrastructure improvements to enhance
border security, the Act authorizes $150 million in appropriations. It also authorizes
appropriations for INS (and DOS) to improve and expand its personnel facilities. It
permits federal agencies involved in border security to waive all or part of its
enrollment fees for technology based programs in order to encourage participation
in the programs. To offset the costs of waiving enrollment fees for technology based
programs, the Act permits an increase in land border fees, if reasonable, for the
issuance of arrival and departure documents.16
The Act addresses the need for increased interagency data sharing pertaining to
the admissibility and removability of aliens by requiring the development and
implementation of an interoperable electronic data system that provides real time
access to federal law enforcement and the intelligence community databases.17 With
respect to the interoperable electronic data system, the Act requires the development
of a technology standard that can be used to verify the identity of aliens. While the
interoperable electronic data system is being developed, the Act requires that federal
law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community share information with
14 The Sept. 30, 2002 deadline was met.
15 For journeyman border patrol agents and inspectors, the Act authorizes the necessary
appropriations to increase the grade level of such personnel (after meeting specified
requirements) from a GS-9 to a GS-11; and for inspections assistants, from GS-5 to a GS-7.
16 INS collects fees for programs that enhance immigration inspection. See

CRS-8
INS (and DOS) pertaining to the admissibility of aliens. To assure that the relevant
information is being shared, the Act requires that a report be submitted to Congress
that identifies the information needed by INS and DOS. Once the report is
completed, the Act requires a coordination plan to be developed that is based on the
report’s findings.
The Act requires that the interoperable electronic data system have the capacity
to compensate for disparate name formats among the various databases; and be able
to search names that are linguistically sensitive. It requires linguistically sensitive
algorithms to be implemented for at least four languages designated as high priorities
by the Secretary of State.18 The Act required the President to establish a Commission
by October 26, 2002 to oversee the development and progress of the interoperable
data system. It authorizes appropriations to develop and implement the interoperable
data system.
With regard to the admission of aliens, the Act requires airline carriers to
provide the Attorney General with electronic passenger manifests before arriving in
or departing from the United States and repeals a provision that requires airport
inspections to be completed within 45 minutes of arrival. It requires a study to
examine the feasibility of establishing a “North American Perimeter Security”
program that would provide for increased cooperation with foreign governments on
questions related to border security. In addition to the study, the Act permits border
inspections agencies, including the immigration inspection agency, to conduct joint
U.S.-Canada inspections projects along the shared border.
The Act also has several provisions that increase the monitoring of foreign
students, including a requirement that the Attorney General establish an electronic
means (i.e., database) to monitor foreign students. Additionally, the Act requires the
electronic system be able to verify the legitimacy of the documentation that accepts
the foreign student to the specified approved institution.19
The Act has several reporting provisions that required:
! the President to submit a report to Congress by September 14, 2002
that identifies federal law enforcement and intelligence information
needed by the Department of State or INS for visa or admission (into
the country) eligibility;
! the President to develop and implement a plan by May 14, 2003 that
requires federal law enforcement agencies and the intelligence
community to provide to DOS and INS information identified by the
agencies;20
18 The Act also required that an additional language algorithm be implemented annually for
3 years following the implementation of the highest priority languages.

Legislation, by Ruth Ellen Wasem.

! the President to submit an interim report to Congress by November
14, 2002 on the progress of implementation of the interoperable data
system;
! the Commission on Interoperable Data Sharing to submit an annual
report to Congress on its findings and recommendations;
! the Attorney General, Secretary of State and NIST to jointly submit
a report to Congress that assesses the actions necessary, and the
considerations to be taken into account (including cost), to fully
achieve by October 26, 2004 the implementation of biometric
identifiable, machine-readable, tamper-resistant travel documents
and the installation of equipment and software at all U.S. ports of
entry that reads and authenticates the biometric identifiable
documents; and
! the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a
report to Congress on the joint U.S.-Canada inspections projects.
The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296). The Homeland
Security Act of 2002 abolishes INS and transfers its immigration enforcement
function (such as border patrol, INS inspections, detention and removal, and interior
enforcement) to a newly created Bureau of Border Security under a Directorate of
Border and Transportation Security in DHS.21 The Act creates an Assistant Secretary
of the Bureau of Border Security who will be in charge of the Bureau and will report
directly to the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security.22
The Act creates a Chief of Policy and Strategy for the Bureau who will be
responsible for making policy recommendations and conducting research and
analysis on immigration enforcement issues. The Chief of Policy and Strategy will
also coordinate immigration policy issues with his counterpart in the Bureau of
Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Act also creates a Legal Advisor position
for the Bureau who will provide legal advice to the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau
of Border Security and represent the Bureau in all exclusion, deportation and removal
proceedings.
With respect to the Bureau of Border Security, the Act requires the Secretary of
DHS to report to Congress no later than 1 year after being sworn into office on how
the Bureau will “comprehensively, effectively, and fairly”enforce the provisions in
the INA that pertain to the enforcement function. It also advances a requirement set

border security to the new Department, see CRS Report RL31549, Department of Homeland
Security: Consolidation of Border and Transportation Security Agencies, William J.
Krouse, Coordinator.

forth in IIRIRA by stating that it is the sense of Congress that the completion of the
14-mile border fence project should be a priority for the Secretary of DHS.23
The Administration’s Reorganization. Under the Administration’s
reorganization, the Bureau of Border Security, along with the Customs Service and
other functions, was separated into two new Bureaus: the Bureau of Immigration and
Customs Enforcement and the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. The
Bureau of Customs and Border Protection includes the Customs Service’s inspection
function, INS border patrol and inspections functions, and the agricultural inspections
function of the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection program. The immigration-related
functions make up the largest portion of this new Bureau.24 The Bureau of
Immigration and Customs Enforcement includes the Custom’s Service interior
enforcement program; the Federal Protective Service; and the former INS’
investigations, detention and removal, and the intelligence functions. The Plan took
effect on March 1, 2003.
Summary of Enacted Legislation. The three main immigration-related
pieces of border security legislation enacted in the 107th Congress sought to
strengthen the nation’s borders and ports of entry by one or more of the following
means:
! requiring the hiring of additional personnel;
! authorizing funding for training personnel;
! increasing the pay rate of certain personnel;
! requiring the development of technology to track the entry and exit
of foreign nationals;
! requiring INS and other border security-related agencies’ databases
to be integrated;
! authorizing funding to improve technology;
! requiring travel documents to be tamper resistant and have a
biometric identifier that is unique to the card holder;
! requiring the installation of biometric identifier readers and scanners
at ports of entry;
! requiring electronic passenger manifests before arriving in or
departing from the United States via an airline carrier;
! requiring the establishment of electronic means to monitor foreign
students; and
! creating a Department of Homeland Security that includes INS’
enforcement and service functions.
23 The 14-mile border fence project was first authorized in IIRIRA and included the
construction of fencing along the United States-Mexico international border that starts at the
Pacific Ocean and extends eastward.
24 The Bush Administration Reorganization Plan dated January 30, 2003, which establishes
this DHS Bureau, includes supportive documents indicating that the former INS border
patrol and immigration inspections portion account for 53% of the Bureau’s funding in
FY2003.
CRS-11
Legislation in the 108th Congress
The Border Infrastructure and Technology Modernization Act (S.
539/H.R. 1096); Comprehensive Homeland Security Act of 2003 (S. 6).
Several pieces of legislation have been introduced in the 108th Congress (the Border
Infrastructure and Technology Modernization Act, S. 539/H.R. 1096; and the
Comprehensive Homeland Security Act of 2003, S. 6) that would authorize funding
for increased personnel and technological improvements. S. 539/H.R. 1096 would
also require the following: (1) ongoing training for immigration inspectors and
investigators on how to use the new technology; (2) an update of a port infrastructure
assessment study and the implementation of the contents of the study; (3)
demonstration projects on new technology at ports of entry; and (4) a National Land
Border Security Plan that would include vulnerability assessments of ports of entry
along the northern border, among other things. S. 539/H.R.1096 would authorize
funding to carry out the mandates. S. 6 would require the former INS and the Bureau
of Border Security to make technological improvements related to border security
and improve and expand programs that facilitate the flow of travel and commerce.
All of the bills have been referred to the appropriate committees and no further action
has been taken.
H.R. 853. Another piece of legislation (a bill that would “establish the position
of Northern Border Coordinator in the Department of Homeland Security,” H.R. 853)
would establish a northern border coordinator within the Directorate of Border and
Transportation Security in the Department of Homeland Security, among other
things. The northern border coordinator would serve as a liaison to the Canadian
government on border security-related issues. The bill has been referred to the
appropriate committees and no further action has been taken.
Issues in the 108th Congress
Technology and Biometric Identifiers in Travel Documents. The
mandate by Congress to issue to aliens visas and other travel documents that have
biometric identifiers and to have the necessary equipment at the ports of entry to scan
and read the documents is paramount to border security. Some contend, however,
that in order to fully achieve border security the neighboring countries (Canada and
Mexico) should implement similar requirements. The Canadian government has fast
tracked the implementation of a machine-readable, permanent fraud-resistant resident
card for new immigrants; and according to the Smart Border Declaration, both
countries have agreed to develop common standards for the biometrics and use
compatible technology to read the biometrics.
The Untied States and Mexican governments entered into a partnership (the
U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Action Plan) that seeks to enhance cooperation
between the two governments. Although the partnership emphasizes enhancing
technology and infrastructure at the border, it does not call for the Mexican
government to implement similar biometric standards or compatible technology to
read the documents that contain a biometric identifier. Some contend that by not
CRS-12
attending to biometric identifiers, Mexico could become a means for terrorists to
sneak into the United States.
Infrastructure Needs at the Border. The requirement of an automated
entry and exit data system (US-VISIT program) at all ports of entry that will record
the arrivals and departures of every alien entering and exiting the country is being
implemented. Some critics contend that the implementation of the system will
interfere with commerce as it may slow traffic at ports of entry. Proponents of the
system, however, contend that by tracking the arrival and departure of foreign
nationals will better secure the country. Many maintain that the successful
development of an automated entry and exit data system may require the United
States and its neighbors (Canada and Mexico) to expand infrastructure at the border.
Critics contend that the current infrastructure at U.S. ports of entry is not sufficient
to accommodate the demands of an entry and exit data system. For example,
additional lanes may be necessary at some ports of entry to accommodate the number
of individuals seeking entry into the United States who will need to be processed
through the system. Moreover, in order to record the departure of every alien who
leaves the United States, there needs to be a “port of exit” that has sufficient lanes,
staff and resources. Currently, there is not such a system. The sending or receiving
countries (i.e., Canada and Mexico) may not have the same number of lanes or the
necessary infrastructure to create additional lanes that would accommodate the
amount of traffic entering and leaving the country via a United States port of entry.
Some contend that this could lead to significant delays as aliens try to make their way
through ports of entry.
Staffing Needs at the Border.25 Prior to the terrorist attacks, several
northern ports of entry were not staffed 24 hours.26 Moreover, many observers
maintain that historically the northern border had been understaffed and lacked the
necessary infrastructure to adequately screen individuals seeking entry into the
United States. At an October 3, 2001 Senate hearing on Northern Border Security,
officials from the former INS testified that they had 334 border patrol agents and 498
inspectors assigned to the northern border compared to over 9,500 border patrol
25 For additional information on immigration-related border security issues at the northern
border, see CRS Report Border Security: U.S.-Canada Immigration Border Issues, by Lisa
M. Seghetti.
26 Prior to Sept. 11, 2001, the former INS and the U.S. Customs Service used the Remote
Video Inspection System (RVIS) to extend operations at non-24 hour ports of entry. RVIS
was designed to enhance security, enforcement and service along low-volume, small, rural
northern ports of entry. Each RVIS site is equipped with video cameras, card readers,
sensors, two-way communications equipment, and a Terminal Device for the Deaf to
transmit images of the travelers, the vehicle, and the contents in the vehicle to the inspector.
RVIS also allows the inspector to communicate with the travelers over a two-way
communications device, review travel documents, and observe the physical area surrounding
the port of entry. RVIS was suspended as a result of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and
has not been reinstated, and the sites that had RVIS have been required to be staffed 24
hours.
CRS-13
agents and inspectors assigned to the geographically smaller southern border.27
Moreover, a DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG) report highlighted deficiencies
with the border patrol along the northern border.28 Among other things, the OIG
report asserted that “the border patrol faced significant enforcement challenges along
the northern border and was unable to adequately respond to illegal activity, primarily
because of a lack of sufficient staff and resources.”29 Contrary to the staffing levels
at the northern border, over the years the southwest border has received more
resources, primarily due to its longstanding history of illegal immigrants attempting
to gain entry into the United States and individuals attempting to smuggle human
beings and drugs into the country.30
Congress has taken action to address the perceived lack of resources at the
northern border by passing several pieces of legislation (see above discussion on
legislation in the 107th Congress). The 108th Congress may consider legislation that
would authorize additional funding to increase immigration personnel at the border

Border Patrol’s Efforts to Improve Northern Border Security, OIG report I-2002-004.

30 The amount of resources allocated to the southwest border was evident in past Commerce-
Justice-State appropriations bills wherein specific amounts were allocated to various
operations that were being conducted at the southwest border as well as to the construction
of physical barriers along the southwest border.

CBP Through the Years
On March 1, 2003, U.S. Customs and Border Protection became the nation’s first comprehensive border security agency with a focus on maintaining the integrity of the nation’s boundaries and ports of entry.
Before CBP, security, compliance and facilitation of international travel and trade were conducted by multiple organizations. The consolidation of these roles and responsibilities allowed CBP to develop seamless security procedures while ensuring compliance with the nation’s immigration, health, and international trade laws and regulations.
CBP Milestones
In establishing CBP, its leadership ensured that the best traditions of its legacy agencies continued from:
1789: U.S. Customs Service, which traced its original functions to July 31, 1789, and noted its role as the progenitor of numerous federal bureaus and agencies. The Customs Service closed with the dawn of CBP, but its commissioner became the leader of CBP and the majority of its staff and responsibilities came to CBP.
1891: Immigration inspectors, who traced their responsibilities to the establishment of the Office of the Superintendent of Immigration on March 3, 1891.
1912: Agriculture inspectors, who traced their roles to the passage of the Plant Quarantine Act on Aug. 20, 1912.
1924: Border Patrol agents, who brought their responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the U.S. borders as they have done since Congress authorized the hiring of Border Patrol personnel on May 28, 1924.
2006: In addition to this core of specialties and responsibilities present at CBP’s founding, CBP also developed an air and marine monitoring capability with the formation of its third uniformed division, the Office of Air and Marine on Jan. 17, 2006.
2006: The Office of International Trade (OT) is established on October 15, 2006, to consolidate trade policy, program development, and compliance measurement functions into one CBP office.

The uniformed ranks are only a portion of CBP’s specialized corps. They are joined by forensic scientists, international trade specialists, public affairs officers and cadres of other specialists and employees who work together to make CBP’s processes more secure, cost effective and efficient.
Because of the work of the people of CBP, the nation’s borders and the American communities around them have never been more secure. But there is much more to be done. As CBP progresses into its second decade, the nation will see a fully integrated approach to international security, trade and travel that makes the world safer, facilitates international travel and trade, and drives the continuous improvement of CBP’s operations.

For Immediate Release
Office of the Press Secretary
January 25, 2002
Securing America's Borders Fact Sheet: Border Security
Action Plan for Creating a Secure and Smart Border
America's borders - land, air or sea - are the boundaries between the United States and the rest of the world. The massive flow of people and goods across our borders helps drive our economy, but can also serve as a conduit for terrorists, weapons of mass destruction, illegal migrants, contraband, and other unlawful commodities. The new threats and opportunities of the 21st century demand a new approach to border management. President Bush envisions a border that is grounded on two key principles:
First, America's air, land, and sea borders must provide a strong defense for the American people against all external threats, most importantly international terrorists but also drugs, foreign disease, and other dangerous items.
Second, America's border must be highly efficient, posing little or no obstacle to legitimate trade and travel.
The President's 2003 Budget begins the process of achieving this vision of the border of the future.
Facts about America's Borders
The United States has a 7500-mile land and air border shared with Canada and Mexico and an exclusive economic zone encompassing 3.4 million square miles.  
Each year, more than 500 million people are admitted into the United States, of which 330 million are non-citizens.  
On land, 11.2 million trucks and 2.2 million rail cars cross into the United States, while 7,500 foreign-flag ships make 51,000 calls in U.S.  ports annually.
The Smart Border of the Future
America requires a border management system that keeps pace with expanding trade while protecting the United States and its territories from the threats of terrorist attack, illegal immigration, illegal drugs, and other contraband. The border of the future must integrate actions abroad to screen goods and people prior to their arrival in sovereign U.S. territory, and inspections at the border and measures within the United States to ensure compliance with entry and import permits. Federal border control agencies must have seamless information-sharing systems that allow for coordinated communication among themselves, and also the broader law enforcement and intelligence gathering communities. This integrated system would provide timely enforcement of laws and regulations. Agreements with our neighbors, major trading partners, and private industry will allow extensive pre-screening of low-risk traffic, thereby allowing limited assets to focus attention on high-risk traffic. The use of advanced technology to track the movement of cargo and the entry and exit of individuals is essential to the task of managing the movement of hundreds of millions of individuals, conveyances, and vehicles.
Some of this work has already begun with Canada, our largest trading partner. On December 12, 2001, Governor Tom Ridge, Director of the Office of Homeland Security, and John Manley, then Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed the ""Smart Border Declaration"" with a 30-point action plan that will help speed and secure the flow of people and goods between the United States and Canada. The Smart Border Declaration recognizes that ""our current and future prosperity and security depend on a border that operates efficiently and effectively under all circumstances."" A similar effort is currently underway with Mexico.
Border Security Initiatives in the 2003 Budget
In the 2003 Budget, the President will propose approximately $11 billion for border security, including $380 million for the Immigration and Naturalization Service to construct a state of the art Entry-Exit visa system. In total, this will represent an increase of $2.2 billion from the 2002 Budget for border security. This additional funding will allow our border agencies to begin implementing a seamless air, land, and sea border that protects the United States against foreign threats while moving legitimate goods and people into and out of the country. The new border initiatives will be managed by the agencies with primary responsibility for border control.
U.S. Customs Service -- Inspections
The President's 2003 Budget increases the inspection budget of the Customs Services by $619 million, for a total of $2.3 billion.  This additional funding increases the ability of the Customs Service to fulfill its critical border security role. Specifically, the additional resources in the 2003 Budget will allow the Customs Service to achieve the following key objectives:
Additional Personnel.  The Customs Service will complete the hiring of approximately 800 new inspectors and agents to carry out additional security activities on our borders and at our seaports.
New Technology.  The President's Budget provides resources to purchase technologically advanced equipment that will assist in inspecting shipments so that time consuming and labor-intensive searches can be minimized.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) -- Enforcement
The President's 2003 Budget increases the INS budget for enforcement by $1.2 billion, for a total of $5.3 billion, including the resources necessary to implement the Entry-Exit visa system. These resources will enhance key INS missions related to homeland security, including border patrol, inspections, and the implementation of a technologically advanced system for monitoring the entry and exit of foreign visitors. Key goals include:
Additional Personnel.   The INS will more than double the number of border patrol agents and inspectors on the northern border. INS will also install integrated information systems to ensure that timely, accurate and complete enforcement data is transmitted to INS agents and other border security agencies operating in the field.
Entry-Exit Tracking System.   The INS will implement a new entry-exit system to track the arrival and departure of non-U.S. citizens. This new system will dramatically improve our ability to deny access to those individuals who should not enter the United States, while speeding the entry of routine, legitimate traffic.
United States Coast Guard
The President's 2003 Budget increases funding for the Coast Guard's homeland security-related missions (protecting ports and coastal areas, as well as interdiction activities) by $282 million, to an overall level of $2.9 billion. After September 11, the Coast Guard's port security mission grew from approximately 1-2 percent of daily operations to between 50-60 percent today. In addition, the Coast Guard has important national security missions such as illegal immigration and drug interdiction and port security.
Coordination.   Working with other port entities, the Coast Guard is developing tracking mechanisms for all vessels operating in the maritime domain: within or transiting to U.S. ports and transiting our coastal waters. The heart of this maritime domain awareness program is accurate information, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance of all vessels, cargo, and people extending well beyond our traditional maritime boundaries.
Coastal Asset and Infrastructure Protection.  Coast Guard forces will provide enhanced defenses for critical high-risk vessels and coastal facilities, marine and otherwise (e.g. nuclear power plants, oil refineries). Close coordination through Harbor Safety Committees, which help bring together the many local, state, and Federal agencies that maintain and protect the harbor, will ensure a well-balanced protective envelope is sustained at different threat levels

Public Safety, Resource Protection & Emergency Services
The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Safety, Resource Protection and Emergency Services (DAS-PRE) oversees the Offices of Law Enforcement and Security, Wildland Fire, Aviation Services, and Emergency Management, and the Program Manager for Interagency Borderland Coordination and Field Communications.  
Although each Office has a distinct charge, their missions intertwine to achieve a common goal: implement appropriate policies, response protocols, and safe practices to ensure the safety of the nearly 70,000 Interior employees and the public who visit or live in close proximity to the over 500 million acres we manage. Four office directors and the Program Manager - Interagency Borderland Coordination and Field Communications support the DAS-PRE.  
Roles and Responsibilities of the DAS-PRE Offices 
Office of Law Enforcement and Security (OLES) 
Established in October 2001, in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, OLES leads the Department’s law enforcement, security, and intelligence activities by providing effective direction, oversight, guidance, and coordination. OLES develops law enforcement, security, and intelligence policies and procedures across Interior and assist bureaus (Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service) in implementing their own law enforcement operations. OLES is responsible for the Department’s Law Enforcement Records Management System, physical security for the Stewart Lee Udall/Main Interior Building in Washington D.C., and the employee/contractor access/security credentials program. During critical incidents or national emergencies, OLES facilitates special law enforcement and security operations.   
Office of Wildland Fire (OWF) 
Interior’s wildland fire program comprises OWF and four bureaus with wildland fire operations—Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. OWF provides governance, policy guidance, budget oversight, and operational accountability and supports the Wildland Fire Information Technology Program jointly with the U.S. Forest Service and other agencies. OWF closely coordinates and fosters essential partnerships with the U.S. Forest Service and other Federal, tribal, state, and local governments and non-governmental partners to help accomplish wildland firefighting missions and reduce wildfire risk.   
Office of Aviation Services (OAS) 
The mission of OAS is to raise the safety standards, increase the efficiency, and promote the economical operation of Interior’s aircraft activities. OAS has four major roles and responsibilities:  1) develop, implement and oversee aviation policy and program development in compliance with Federal aviation regulations; 2) deliver safe, mission-ready, inspected aircraft and qualified pilots and train bureau personnel to support Interior’s mission; 3) conduct aircraft and equipment research and development; and 4) represent Interior within the Federal interagency community and aviation industry/academia. OAS has the government’s leading unmanned aircraft system program. 
Office of Emergency Management (OEM) 
The Office of Emergency Management (OEM) leads efforts to enhance protection and preservation of our employees, volunteers and visitors and of the lands and resources with which we are entrusted. OEM provides expertise and leadership for the Department’s emergency management responsibilities worldwide by integrating emergency management programs and functions, and supporting activities to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from natural hazards such as fires, floods and earthquakes and ecosystem hazards such as oil spills and wildlife disease outbreaks.   
OEM develops and coordinates policy and provides oversight and direction to develop integrated and comprehensive bureau and office emergency management programs across Interior. These programs cover all types of emergencies affecting Federal and tribal lands, facilities, infrastructure, and resources. 
Program Manager - Interagency Borderland Coordination and Field Communications  
The Department established the Program Manager in response to increased border security activities initiated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the mid-2000’s and the subsequent increase in the use of DOI managed lands by the U.S. Border Patrol. A major responsibility of the Program Manager is to protect natural and cultural resources on the border by assuring timely and effective coordination between the Department, its bureaus, and DHS to avoid, minimize, and mitigate possible impacts on DOI managed lands and by strategically working with bureaus to identify solutions when challenges arise. In addition to border related activities, the Program Manager also leads efforts to collectively improve field communications within DOI.

For positions at GS-9 and above, experience must have included interpreting and enforcing Immigration and Naturalization Service or comparable laws, rules, and regulations.
Test Requirements
Refer to Section V of this Manual for information about test requirements. Also, since all Agents must learn the Spanish language, applicants must successfully complete a language test (in addition to the written test requirement for competitive appointment at grades GS-5 and GS-7). Those who do not speak Spanish will undergo an artificial language test (ALT) designed to assess their ability to learn Spanish. Those who are fluent in the Spanish language will be given the choice of taking the ALT or a Spanish proficiency test. Both tests will be administered on a pass/fail basis.
Bilingual Ability
Border Patrol work requires the ability to speak and read Spanish as well as English. All persons appointed are instructed in speaking and reading Spanish as part of the basic training for Border Patrol Agents, and must be proficient by the final probationary examination (usually 10 months after entry on duty).
Ability To Use Firearms
All positions require qualification in the use of firearms. Proficiency with standard issue firearms must be demonstrated for successful completion of training. All Agents are required to carry a handgun in the performance of their duties, and to qualify periodically with that handgun.
Valid Driver's License
Applicants must possess a valid driver's license at the time of appointment. They must qualify to operate motor vehicles in accordance with applicable government regulations after they are hired.
Employment Interview
Applicants for all grade levels must demonstrate in a pre-employment interview that they possess the traits and characteristics important to Border Patrol Agent positions. These include judgment, problem solving, emotional stability, and interpersonal skills.
Maximum Entry Age Requirements
Under the authority of Public Law 100-238, the U. S. Department of Justice has established the date immediately preceding one's 37th birthday as the maximum age for original entry into the position of Border Patrol Agent.
Medical Requirements
The duties of positions in this series involve physical exertion under rigorous environmental conditions including unpredictable exposure to loud sounds, stress, and extremes of heat and cold; irregular and protracted hours of work over rugged terrain; patrol duties on foot, motor vehicle, and aircraft; and participation in physical training. Applicants must be in sound physical condition and of good muscular development.
Vision: inocular vision is required and must test 20/40 (Snellen) without corrective lenses. Uncorrected vision must test at least 20/70 in each eye. Vision in each eye must be corrected to 20/20. Near vision, corrected or uncorrected, must be sufficient to read Jaeger Type 2 at 14 inches. Ability to distinguish basic colors by pseudoisochromatic plate test (missing no more than four plates) is required, as is normal peripheral vision. Based on the results of clinical studies of candidates who have undergone Radial Keratotomy eye operations to correct vision defects, the medical techniques of Radial Keratotomy or Orthokeratology will not be accepted as a means of meeting Border Patrol Agent vision requirements.
Hearing: Using an audiometer for measurement, there should be no loss of 30 or more decibels in each ear at the 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz levels.
Speech: Diseases or conditions resulting in indistinct speech are disqualifying.
Respiratory System: Any chronic disease or condition affecting the respiratory system that would impair the full performance of duties of the position is disqualifying, e.g., conditions that result in reduced pulmonary function, shortness of breath, or painful respiration.
Cardiovascular System: The following conditions are disqualifying: organic heart disease (compensated or not), hypertension with repeated readings that exceed 150 systolic and 90 diastolic without medication, and symptomatic peripheral vascular disease and severe varicose veins.
Gastrointestinal System: Chronic symptomatic diseases or conditions of the gastrointestinal tract are disqualifying. Medical conditions requiring long-term use of medication(s) may be disqualifying. Each case will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis prior to any employment decision.
Endocrine System: Systemic metabolic disease that is likely to affect job performance adversely, such as uncontrolled diabetes, is disqualifying.
Genito Urinary Disorders: Chronic, symptomatic diseases or conditions of the genito urinary tract are disqualifying.
Extremities and Spine: Any deformity or disease that would interfere with range of motion or dexterity to the extent that it would affect adversely the full performance of the duties of the position is disqualifying.
Hernias: Inguinal and femoral hernias with or without the use of a truss are disqualifying. Other hernias are disqualifying if they interfere with performance of the duties of the position.
Nervous System: Applicants must possess emotional and mental stability with no history of a basic personality disorder. Any neurological disorder that could result in seizures, convulsions, loss of consciousness, or decreased neurological or muscular function is disqualifying.
Miscellaneous: Though not mentioned specifically above, any other disease or condition that interferes with the full performance of duties is also grounds for medical rejection. Before entrance on duty, all applicants must undergo a pre-employment medical examination and be medically suitable to perform the full range of duties of the position efficiently and without hazard to themselves and others. Failure to meet any one of the required medical qualifications will be disqualifying for appointment. These standards are considered minimum standards and will not be waived in any case. Applicants found to have a correctable condition may be restored to any existing list of eligibles for further consideration for appointment when the disqualifying condition is satisfactorily corrected or eliminated.

North American Free Trade Agreement
Printer-friendly version
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) established a free-trade zone in North America; it was signed in 1992 by Canada, Mexico, and the United States and took effect on Jan. 1, 1994. NAFTA immediately lifted tariffs on the majority of goods produced by the signatory nations. It also calls for the gradual elimination, over a period of 15 years, of most remaining barriers to cross-border investment and to the movement of goods and services among the three countries.
