Office of Public Affairs
War crimes charges against four Russia-affiliated military personnel were unsealed today in the Eastern District of Virginia. The charges include torture, inhuman treatment, and unlawful confinement of a U.S. national in Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Suren Seiranovich Mkrtchyan, 45, Dmitry Budnik, Valerii LNU (last name unknown), and Nazar LNU were each charged in connection with their unlawful detainment of a U.S. national in the context of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The defendants are alleged to have interrogated, severely beaten, and tortured the victim. They also allegedly threatened to kill the victim and conducted a mock execution.
“As the world has witnessed the horrors of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, so has the United States Department of Justice,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “That is why the Justice Department has filed the first ever charges under the U.S. war crimes statute against four Russia- affiliated military personnel for heinous crimes against an American citizen. The Justice Department will work for as long as it takes to pursue accountability and justice for Russia’s war of aggression.”
“Thanks to the tireless and unprecedented work of federal law enforcement agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the Justice Department, four Russian soldiers, accused of unthinkable, unacceptable human rights violations against an American citizen, have been charged with war crimes and will be brought to justice,” said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “The indictments unsealed today send a clear message to Russia – our government will spare no effort and spare no resource to hold accountable those who violate the fundamental human rights of an American.”
“Since the start of their unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Russia has weaponized human rights abuses to wreak unimaginable tragedy,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “Today’s indictment – the first ever under the U.S. war crimes statute – makes clear that the FBI will work with the full cooperation of international law enforcement to bring justice to the victims of these atrocities. The human toll of the conflict in Ukraine weighs heavily on the hearts of the FBI, and we’re resolved to hold war criminals accountable no matter where they are or how long it takes.”
“Torturing and unlawfully confining a protected person are serious human rights abuses that must not go unpunished,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “These historic criminal charges – the first ever brought under the U.S. war crimes statute – are an important step in the Justice Department’s continuing efforts to pursue every avenue of accountability for those who commit war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.”
According to allegations in the indictment, Mkrtchyan and Budnik were commanding officers of military units of the Russian Armed Forces and/or the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and Valerii and Nazar were lower-ranking military personnel. The defendants are alleged to have been fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine when they allegedly committed war crimes.
In April 2022, Mkrtchyan and soldiers under his command allegedly abducted the victim, a U.S. national, from his home in the village of Mylove in the Kherson Oblast region in southern Ukraine and unlawfully confined him for at least 10 days. During the abduction, Mkrtchyan, Valerii, Nazar, and others allegedly threw the victim face down to the ground while he was naked, tied his hands behind his back, pointed a gun at his head, and severely beat him, including with the stocks of their guns. Mkrtchyan, Valerii, Nazar, and others then allegedly transported the victim to an improvised military compound in Mylove.
“These charges reflect that the defendants’ alleged actions are not only grave breaches of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, but also violations of U.S. law,” said U.S. Attorney Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia. “We are proud to be at the forefront of the Justice Department’s effort to hold perpetrators of war crimes violations accountable in Ukraine and will continue to pursue them. We thank our investigative partners on this case, the War Crimes Accountability Team, the FBI Washington Field Office, and Homeland Security Investigations for their outstanding efforts to gather evidence required for these charges.”
The indictment also alleges that Mkrtchyan and Budnik led and participated in at least two interrogation sessions during which the four defendants and others tortured the victim. During one interrogation, Mkrtchyan, Valerii, and Nazar allegedly stripped off the victim’s clothes and photographed him. The defendants and others then allegedly severely beat the victim, pointed guns at the back of his head, and threatened to shoot him. Budnik allegedly threatened the victim with death and asked for his last words. Shortly thereafter, Nazar and others allegedly conducted a mock execution. They allegedly forced the victim to the ground, put a gun to the back of his head, then moved the gun slightly and shot a bullet just past the victim’s head.
“These historic charges are the culmination of a complex investigation by the FBI and our partners that spans the globe,” said Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office. “The FBI will continue to work alongside our domestic and international partners to pursue justice and hold those accountable who commit such atrocities against others.”
“Acting on behalf of the Russian Armed Forces and the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, these four individuals allegedly violated the human rights of an American citizen,” said Executive Associate Director Katrina W. Berger of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).  “According to the charges, they unlawfully detained and tortured the American citizen, and even went so far as to carry out a mock execution. The unsealing of these charges for war crimes is an important step in bringing the responsible parties to justice. HSI will continue to aggressively pursue anyone who violates the human rights of our American citizens – at home or overseas.”
The defendants are charged with three war crimes – unlawful confinement, torture, and inhuman treatment – and one count of conspiracy to commit war crimes. If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum penalty of life in prison.
The FBI Washington Field Office and HSI Washington, D.C., Field Office, with assistance from the FBI’s International Human Rights Unit and HSI’s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center, investigated the war crimes allegations in partnership with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Justice Department’s War Crimes Accountability Team, which is based in the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.
HRSP Trial Attorney and Lead Prosecutor for the War Crimes Accountability Team Christian Levesque, HRSP Trial Attorney Patrick Jasperse, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander E. Blanchard for the Eastern District of Virginia are prosecuting the case, with significant assistance from Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas W. Traxler for the Eastern District of Virginia. HRSP historians and other staff provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution.
The Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Appellate Section, Office of Enforcement Operations, and Office of International Affairs, as well as the National Security Division, also provided valuable assistance. The Justice Department is grateful for the substantial assistance the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine has provided in furthering the investigation.
Members of the public who have information about human rights violators in the United States or the location of the defendants named in this indictment are urged to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or through the FBI online tip formLinks to other government and non-government sites will typically appear with the “external link” icon to indicate that you are leaving the Department of Justice website when you click the link. or HSI at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE or through the ICE online tip formLinks to other government and non-government sites will typically appear with the “external link” icon to indicate that you are leaving the Department of Justice website when you click the link..

Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA)
Pursuant to a delegation by the President, we have used the emergency Presidential Drawdown Authority on 44 occasions since August 2021 to provide Ukraine military assistance totaling approximately $23.8 billion from DoD stockpiles.
On August 14, 2023, the Department announced the first of several packages utilizing previously authorized PDA Authority. During DoD’s regular oversight of their execution of previous Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine, they discovered that they had been incorrectly overvaluing the weapons and equipment in previous PDAs that had been authorized or Ukraine. DoD then undertook a review using the appropriate accounting method, which restored $6.2 billion that can be used under Congressionally authorized drawdown authority to provide arms and equipment to meet Ukraine’s urgent security requirements.  As PDA is an authority, not a funding source, once notified to Congress there is no ‘expiration date’ for the provision of defense articles and services up to the value that was notified.  Any additional space within the previously notified PDAs, identified as a result of DOD’s recalculation of the value of previous PDAs therefore remains available for Ukraine regardless of the end of the fiscal year.
Security Assistance
To date, Congress has appropriated $4.65 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) across two supplemental packages for Ukraine and “countries impacted by the situation in Ukraine.” Of this total, $4 billion has been notified to Congress. The first Ukraine supplemental also provided $4 billion in FMF loan authority and $4 billion in loan guarantees to NATO Allies.
So far in FY2023, DoD has provided $12.1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) in eight separate tranches.
In FY 2023 to date, the Department notified Congress of our intent to make an additional $1.1 billion in long-term investments with FMF to bolster the security of Ukraine and 13 regional partners and allies in Europe who are at risk from potential future Russian aggression. These funds will help our allies and partners in the region to backfill military capabilities they have donated to Ukraine, enable new donations to Ukraine, and support longer-term military requirements in both the broader region and in Ukraine itself. On September 6, 2023, the Secretary announced an additional $100 million in Foreign Military Financing to support Ukraine’s longer-term military requirements.
On September 8, 2022, the Department notified Congress of our intent to make a further $2.2 billion available in long-term investments under Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to bolster the security of Ukraine and 17 of its regional neighbors; including both many of our NATO allies as well as other regional security partners who are most potentially at risk for future Russian aggression. These funds will help our allies and partners who have provided security assistance to Ukraine backfill their capabilities.
On April 24, 2022, the Department notified Congress of its intention to obligate more than $713 million in Foreign Military Financing funding for Ukraine and 15 other Allied and partner nations in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans.  Assistance in this Notification will help NATO Allies backfill capabilities they have donated to Ukraine from their own stockpiles to retain and strengthen NATO deterrence.
So far in FY2023, DoD has provided $12.1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) in eight separate tranches.
In FY2022, DoD provided $6.3 billion in security assistance to Ukraine under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) in seven separate tranches.  All the FY2022 USAI funds appropriated by Congress have now been committed. In FY 2021, Ukraine received $275 million under DoD’s Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI).  This included $75 million in lethal assistance.
In FY 2021, the Department provided Ukraine $115 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and $3 million in International Military Education and Training (IMET) funding.  Prior to Russia’s renewed invasion, FMF supported Ukraine’s acquisition of a wide array of capabilities including counter-mortar radars, secure radios, vehicles, electronic equipment, small arms and light weapons, and medical supplies, among others.
The Global Security Contingency Fund, a joint program of the U.S. Departments of State and Defense, has provided more than $42 million in training, advisory services, and equipment to assist the Government of Ukraine to further develop the tactical, operational, and institutional capacities of its Special Operations Forces, National Guard, conventional forces, non-commissioned officer corps, and combat medical care since 2014.
Excess Defense Articles (EDA)
On February 20, 2022, the United States utilized the Excess Defense Articles program  to transfer Mi-17 helicopters to Ukraine.
Since 2018, the United States has provided Ukraine with four refitted U.S. Coast Guard Island-Class cutters.  The refit was funded with Ukrainian national funds and FMF.  Additional vessels are pending transfer.
Third Party Transfers (TPT)
In advance of Russia’s invasion and after the outbreak of war in February 2022, the United States approved Third Party Transfers from 14 NATO Allies and close partners to provide U.S.-origin equipment from their inventories for use by Ukrainian forces.  Deliveries to date include almost 12,000 anti-armor systems of all types; more than 1,550 anti-air missiles; radars; night vision devices; machine guns; rifles and ammunition; and body armor.  The contributions from our partners and Allies are vital and appreciated.
Foreign Military Sales
The United States has $595.9 million in active government-to-government sales cases with Ukraine under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system.  FMS sales notified to Congress are listed on the DSCA website, and significant prior sales include the: 2022 sale of non-standard artillery ammunition;  2018 sale of 210 Javelin anti-armor missiles, which first provided Ukraine with a critical anti-armor capability; the 2019 sale of 150 additional Javelins; and the 2020 Mark VI patrol boats sale.  The Javelin sales were funded by a mixture of State Department FMF funds and Ukrainian national funds.
Direct Commercial Sales
From 2015 through 2020, the United States also authorized the permanent export of over $274 million in defense articles and services to Ukraine via Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).  The top categories of DCS exports to Ukraine during that period were Category III: Ammunition and Ordnance ($88 million); Category XII: Fire Control, Laser, Imaging, and Guidance Equipment, ($69 million); and Category XI: Military Electronics ($22 million).
Border Security
Since 2017, the Department of State’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation has provided over $34.8 million in Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs support to Ukraine through the Export Control and Border Security (EXBS) Program. The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine (SBGS) has been a primary recipient of EXBS assistance. EXBS also provided assistance to Ukraine Customs and export control and sanctions authorities. Until Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, a major focus of EXBS efforts was the development of SBGS’s Maritime Border Guard operational and sustainment capabilities to replace capabilities lost during Russia’s unlawful annexation of Crimea and introduce modernized equipment, training, and procedures. EXBS also provided advisory and equipment assistance for SBGS land border elements. Following Russia’s further invasion in February 2022, EXBS transitioned to providing non-lethal assistance and continued advisory support to the SBGS and other government partners. In addition, EXBS is also providing $6.9 million in regional NADR funding to support sanctions and export control implementation to respond to Russia’s aggression.
Conventional Weapons Destruction
On September 30, 2022 the Department awarded $47.6 million to Tetra Tech to launch a large-scale train and equip project to strengthen the Government of Ukraine’s demining and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) capacity. This project forms part of the $91.5 million in assistance that the Department will provide over FY2023 to help the Government of Ukraine address the urgent humanitarian challenges posed by explosive remnants of war created by Russia’s brutal war of aggression. On September 6, 2023, the Department announced an additional $90.5 million in humanitarian demining assistance.
Russia’s war against Ukraine has littered massive swaths of the country with landmines and unexploded ordnance. The Government of Ukraine estimates that 160,000 square kilometers of its land may be contaminated – this is roughly the size of the states of Virginia, Maryland, and Connecticut combined, or nearly twice the size of Austria. These explosive hazards block access to farmland, delay or otherwise harm reconstruction efforts, and prevent displaced people from returning to their homes. They may also continue to kill and maim Ukrainian civilians for years to come.
Tetra Tech’s expert instructors will train Government of Ukraine demining and EOD teams to international standards, provide equipment, and mentor trained personnel. The project also supports deploying additional clearance teams and explosive ordnance risk education teams through the local non-governmental organization Ukrainian Deminers Association (UDA).
From 2004 to 2021, the United States provided more than $77.3 million to clear landmines and unexploded ordnance left by Russia’s forces and Russia’s proxies in the Donbas region, strengthen Ukraine’s demining capacity, and enhance security services’ capacity to manage weapons and ammunition stockpiles.  In 2021 alone, the U.S. government funded Conventional Weapons Destruction (CWD) programs that cleared and returned more than 1.9 million square meters (477 acres) of land to local communities that was previously contaminated with explosive hazards.  Since Russia’s further invasion, U.S.-funded digital explosive ordnance risk education campaigns have provided lifesaving information to more than 18 million people in Ukraine.  Additionally, Ukrainian demining authorities previously trained and equipped by the United States are leading emergency efforts to remediate the massive levels of explosive hazard contamination littered across the country by Russian forces.
Global Peacekeeping Operations
Ukraine was a significant troop contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations before its troops were called home to defend Ukraine, including a helicopter unit to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).  Ukraine is also a partner country of the Global Peace Operations Initiative and has benefited from nearly $4 million in peace operations capacity-building assistance.
State Partnership Program Ukraine is partnered with the California National Guard under DoD’s State Partnership Program (SPP)  .  Established in 1993, SPP’s goal was to assist former Warsaw Pact and Soviet states in their democracy efforts and to reform their defense forces following the Soviet Union’s collapse.  Over the past 29 years, California National Guard conducted regular military-to-military engagements with Ukrainian forces, contributing to Ukraine’s continued defense modernization.
Joint Exercises
Ukraine participates in multiple bilateral and multilateral military exercises with the United States, EU, and NATO Allies to include Rapid Trident, Sea Breeze, and Cossack Mace.

SPEECH
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks Announcing Four Russia-Affiliated Military Personnel Charged with War Crimes in Connection with Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine
Wednesday, December 6, 2023

Washington, DC
United States
Remarks as Delivered
Good morning.
I am joined today by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, FBI Director Chris Wray, Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole Argentieri, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Jessica Aber, and ICE Acting Deputy Director Staci Barrera.
Also here are Eli Rosenbaum, the head of the Department’s War Crimes Accountability Team, Christian Levesque, Lead Prosecutor for the War Crimes Accountability Team, and David Sundberg, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI Washington Field Office.
On February 24, 2022, Russia commenced its full-scale, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
In the nearly two years since, we have all seen invading Russian forces commit atrocities on the largest scale in any European armed conflict since the Second World War.
We have all heard the accounts of Ukrainian civilians targeted and executed, Ukrainian children forcibly deported, and Ukrainian women and girls sexually assaulted.
And as the world has witnessed the horrors of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, so has the United States Department of Justice.
That is why the Justice Department has filed the first ever charges under the U.S. war crimes statute against four Russia-affiliated military personnel for heinous crimes against an American citizen. Congress passed the U.S. war crimes statute nearly 30 years ago to give us jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes committed against American citizens abroad.
In an indictment returned yesterday in the Eastern District of Virginia, we have charged four Russia-affiliated military personnel with war crimes against an American citizen living in Ukraine. The charges include conspiracy to commit war crimes, including war crimes outlawed by the international community after World War II — unlawful confinement, torture, and inhuman treatment.
Like all defendants in the U.S. criminal justice system, the defendants in this case are entitled to due process of law and are presumed innocent until proven guilty. 
We allege that in April of 2022, two commanding officers of Russia-affiliated forces, Suren Seiranovich Mkrtchyan and Dmitry Budnik, as well as two lower-ranking soldiers, whose first names are Valerii and Nazar, committed war crimes against an American citizen who had been living in Ukraine since 2021.
That victim was living in Mylove, a small village in Southern Ukraine, and was not participating in the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As such, the victim was what is known as a “protected person,” under international law.
After Russian forces invaded Mylove, the victim was abducted from his home by three of the defendants — Mkrtchyan, who was one of the commanding officers, and Valerii and Nazar, the lower-ranking soldiers — and their co-conspirators.
During the abduction, we allege that those defendants threw the victim to the ground while he was naked, tied his hands behind his back, pointed a gun at his head, and beat him with their feet, their fists, and the stocks of their guns.
We allege that they forced him into a building that Russia-affiliated forces were using as a jail, and into a closet that they were using as a jail cell.
We allege that, as they interrogated him, they tortured him. They beat him, again, with a gun. They punched him in his chest and stomach. They threatened to shoot him. They stripped off his clothes and took pictures. One of their conspirators threatened to sexually assault him.
And during the interrogation, when the victim’s answers did not satisfy the defendants, we allege that Budnik, who was also a commanding officer, threatened the victim with death and asked for his last words.
We allege that Nazar and other co-conspirators then took the victim outside. There, they forced him to the ground and put a gun to the back of his head. The victim believed he was about to be killed.
They moved the gun just before pulling the trigger, and the bullet went past his head. After the mock execution, the victim was beaten and interrogated again. At one point, he was told through an interpreter that he was “going to sleep,” and he was told by Mkrtchya: “goodnight” — leading the victim to believe, again, that he was about to be killed.
During his 10 days detained by Russia-affiliated forces, the victim in this case was tortured, threatened with sexual assault and execution, forced to perform manual labor, and beaten in the head, chest, and stomach with the soldiers’ feet, their fists, and their guns. Again and again, he believed he was going to die.
These charges against four Russia-affiliated military personnel are the Justice Department’s first criminal charges under the U.S. war crimes statute. They are also an important step toward accountability for the Russian regime’s illegal war in Ukraine. Our work is far from done.
I want to recognize the Criminal Division, including the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and the War Crimes Accountability Team, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security, including Homeland Security Investigations. Their diligent and skillful work is what made these historic charges possible.
I also want to recognize the incredible courage of our partners in Ukraine, specifically our counterparts in the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office. In the midst of war, Ukrainian prosecutors and investigators have risked their lives to pursue justice for the Ukrainian people. We are honored to stand alongside them.
Finally, I want to recognize our partners in the international community.
We will continue to work closely alongside them to gather evidence and build cases so that when the time comes, the United States and our partners will be ready to ensure accountability for Russia’s war of aggression.
This is an historic day for the Justice Department that builds on a long history.
The War Crimes Accountability Team prosecuting this case is modeled in part on the Justice Department’s decades-long effort to identify, denaturalize, and deport Nazi war criminals in the United States.
During that effort, the Department’s Office of Special Investigations brought more than 130 cases against perpetrators of Nazi crimes. 
In the vast majority of those cases, the perpetrators were not identified until decades after they committed their horrific crimes. 
This history should make clear that the Justice Department — and the American people — have a long memory. We will not forget the atrocities in Ukraine. And we will never stop working to bring those responsible to justice.
Throughout our work, we will continue to put our trust in the rule of law.
The rule of law is the best answer we have to crimes that cannot truly be answered.
The rule of law is how we pursue true accountability for the individuals responsible for those crimes, and how we deter future aggression.
And the rule of law is how we pursue justice in a way that protects people, and protects our shared humanity.
I am now honored to turn the podium over to Secretary Mayorkas.

Importance of Methane
Introductory Video
GMI created a Methane Mitigation Matters video  to explain the role of methane in climate change and provide an overview of the biogas, coal mine, and oil & gas sectors.
Methane (CH4) is a hydrocarbon that is a primary component of natural gas. Methane is also a greenhouse gas (GHG), so its presence in the atmosphere affects the earth’s temperature and climate system. Methane is emitted from a variety of anthropogenic (human-influenced) and natural sources. Anthropogenic emission sources include landfills, oil and natural gas systems, agricultural activities, coal mining, stationary and mobile combustion, wastewater treatment, and certain industrial processes. 
Methane is the second most abundant anthropogenic GHG after carbon dioxide (CO2), accounting for about 16 percent of global emissions. Methane is more than 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Over the last two centuries, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have more than doubled, largely due to human-related activities. Because methane is both a powerful greenhouse gas and short-lived compared to carbon dioxide, achieving significant reductions would have a rapid and significant effect on atmospheric warming potential.
Visit EPA's Methane page for detailed information about sources of methane, trends, and projections of future methane emissions

Other Things to Know About Methane Emissions
Who are the biggest methane emitters?
China, the United States, Russia, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Mexico are estimated to be responsible for nearly half of all anthropogenic methane emissions. The major methane emission sources for these countries vary greatly. For example, a key source of methane emissions in China is coal production, whereas Russia emits most of its methane from natural gas and oil systems. The largest sources of methane emissions from human activities in the United States are oil and gas systems, livestock enteric fermentation, and landfills.
Why aren’t efforts to capture and profitably use methane emissions more widespread?
Despite multiple benefits, methane recovery is not widespread for several reasons.
Methane is generally a secondary byproduct in the industrial processes from which it is emitted. Coal mines, for example, seek to vent methane from the mine workings because it can cause explosions. Historically, mining companies have not viewed the associated methane as an energy resource in its own right.
Those responsible for the emissions may not be familiar with the technologies available for methane recovery or the potential for profitable recovery projects. This is especially true in developing countries where improved access to information and technical training would be beneficial to generating support for methane recovery projects.
Poorly functioning energy markets and financially insolvent utilities and municipalities within many countries fail to provide the private sector with a climate that will attract their investment in projects to capture and utilize methane.

Facts versus Russia’s false claims (YYYY-MM-DD)
Posted on: 2023-12-15 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
On November 30th, Russia declared the “international LGBT social movement” an “extremist organization”.
The “extremist” label carries severe legal consequences for everyone involved in LGBTQI+-related activities or even having a known, or assumed, association with the LGBTQI+ community.
This is an assault on human rights for thousands of Russians.
Russia’s false claim:
Putin claims he defends the values and freedoms of Russian citizens.
Posted on: 2023-12-06 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
Russian authorities are eradicating media freedom through blocking internet content, imprisoning journalists, and adopting “fake news” and defamation laws.
At least 1,000 Russian journalists have fled Russia since Russia’s full-scale invasion.
Russia’s false claim:
Putin claims to defend the freedoms of Russians.
Posted on: 2023-11-23 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
The World Food Programme has delivered 343,300 tonnes of Ukrainian grain to African countries through the Black Sea grain corridor in 2022 and 2023.
This is 7 times more than what Russia has pledged in humanitarian grain aid for African countries in 2023.
Russia’s false claim:
Putin claims that Russia can easily fill the gap of humanitarian needs left by the end of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
Posted on: 2023-11-17 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
Russia is coercing Ukrainians living in temporarily occupied territories to enlist in the Russian armed forces, which is a violation of international law. Russia’s coercive conscription tactics include:
Interrogating and threatening Ukrainians to join the Russian armed forces;
Forcing retirees and those normally exempted to join the Russian army;
Threatening family members to reveal the whereabouts of Ukrainians who have escaped conscription.
Russia’s false claim:
Russian authorities claim they want to protect the citizens of the territories they illegally occupy.
Posted on: 2023-11-14 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
Russia’s invasion has resulted in 30% of Ukraine’s protected areas being bombed, polluted, burned or otherwise affected.
Russia’s false claim:
Russian authorities claim they wants to protect the environment.
Posted on: 2023-11-10 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
Russian trade in goods and services declined significantly in 2022 and exports are forecasted to further drop in 2023. (Source: World Bank)
70% of assets of the Russian banking system are under sanctions (Source: Council of the European Union).
The Kremlin’s sanction-avoidance strategy is making Russia dependent on other non-democratic regimes for raw materials and supplies.
Russia’s false claim:
Putin claims that Western sanctions are boosting Russia’s economy.
Posted on: 2023-10-30 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
In occupied regions, Ukrainians without a Russian passport are being denied access to basic health care and life-saving medication, including insulin.
Russia’s false claim:
The Kremlin claims that they do not intend to impose anything by force.
Posted on: 2023-10-25 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
Ukrainian citizens in illegally occupied regions are told by Russian forces that they could lose their land or be deported if they do not get a Russian passport.
Russia’s false claim:
The Kremlin claims that they do not intend to impose anything by force.
Posted on: 2023-10-25 - National Defence
The facts:
Russia has committed significant personnel, armoured vehicles, and artillery fires around Avdiivka, which is indicative of offensive operations and not an “active defence”.
Similar to Russia’s failed offensives conducted earlier in the year, Russian personnel and equipment have suffered significant losses for minimal progress around Avdiivka. This further demonstrates Russia’s difficulty in conducting successful combined arms offensives.
Russia’s false claim:
As of October 20, 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defence continued to refer to Russia’s offensive in the vicinity of Avdiivka as part of an “active defence”.
Posted on: 2023-10-19 - Global Affairs Canada
The facts:
The Kremlin is forcing parents in occupied regions of Ukraine to register newborns as Russian by threatening to take away their parental rights.
Russia’s false claim:
The Kremlin claims it wants to protect children in regions it illegally occupies.

HIV in Russia Is a Human Rights Problem

RUSSIA AND EURASIA
St. Petersburg, Russia - May 1, 2019: A march for the rights of Russians living with HIV/AIDS. One demonstrator holds a sign that reads ""Living with HIV is not a crime"".
IMAGE CREDIT
Globally, over 39 million people are living with infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Over one million of this number live in Russia. The World Health Organization considers acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by HIV, to be an international public health epidemic.
While the Russian government has taken some limited action to mitigate this crisis, the measures are inadequate to address the root of the problem. Instead of tackling the epidemic’s causes, the Russian government is sending those who are incarcerated and living with HIV to the front lines to help wage its war in Ukraine. Such pacts with the devil, along with stigmatization, legal corralling, and refusal to provide treatment, mean that HIV/AIDS has evolved into a massive human rights problem in Russia.
The HIV Epidemic in Russia
As recently as 2022, Russia was cited as having the fifth highest rate of new HIV diagnoses globally. The Russian Health Ministry dismissed such assessments as “provocative propaganda.” The high prevalence of HIV is attributable to multiple factors, including high rates of intravenous drug use and unprotected sex among high-risk populations.
The Russian government has rejected the traditional tried-and-true epidemic responses, including sex education, HIV care and treatment, and other harm reduction tools, many of which have been successful in such countries as Thailand.
Today, Russia’s response remains muted, and the crisis continues to grow. The rate of infections is estimated to increase by 10 percent to 15 percent per year, meaning that up to 150,000 Russians will be diagnosed with HIV in 2023 alone. Russia’s population is over 140 million people. For comparison, in the United States, with a population of over 330 million, approximately 36,000 are estimated to be infected in 2023.
Additionally, Russia remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. An anti-gay propaganda bill was passed several years ago, and there is no sign of abatement in the hatred expressed toward the LGBTQ community. Legal and societal reproof further drive vulnerable populations away from seeking treatment, even when it is available.
Instead of implementing changes to address the situation, Russia is headed in the opposite direction. A 2021 report from Human Rights Watch documented how a twenty-nine-year-old Russian living with HIV was attacked after his HIV-positive status became public. A police investigation yielded no arrests. Sadly, such are not isolated incidents.
Red HIV Wristbands
In 2023, new reporting indicated what was previously considered unthinkable: in exchange for providing life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART) to Russian convicts living with HIV, the Russian government began demanding that they serve in the Russian Armed Forces. Many were sent to the front lines. It was estimated that 20 percent of all new Russian Armed Forces recruits from prisons had HIV.
Those Russian service members who are living with HIV infection are made to wear red wristbands, indicating their HIV status. There are even reports that some doctors refuse to provide them with medical treatment or battlefield first aid because of their status.
It is not currently known how many in the Russian military live with HIV. Some estimates are as low as several thousand. Official Russian Ministry of Defense figures are believed to be inaccurate, as most Russian service members are not tested for the virus.
While the Russian military currently lists HIV as a disqualifying medical condition, reporting by Meduza shows that the process to achieve disqualification is arduous and official guidance often is not followed. One individual reported that a military recruiter, when informed of the prospective service member’s HIV status, said, “Do you give a damn where you die?”
Even in cases where the Russian military is aware that an individual has been diagnosed with HIV, there is no current evidence to show that these individuals are receiving the ART needed to keep them healthy.
Everyone Has Rights
Those on the front lines of the war in Ukraine who are taken prisoner must be provided by the Ukrainian government with adequate medical care, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. Current data are not available, but in light of the difficult environment and high rates of HIV among Russian convicts conscripted to serve in the war, there are likely significant challenges to treating Russian prisoners who are HIV-positive.
UNAIDS is the UN organization charged with coordinating global action on HIV/AIDS around the globe. It is headquartered in Geneva, adjacent to the World Health Organization. As part of its work, UNAIDS is central to the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). One of the rights enumerated in the ICESCR is the “right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.” The Russian Federation is a signatory to the covenant, but Russia’s current practices are not in line with its treaty obligations.
Russia Must Acknowledge the Crisis
Key to addressing the HIV crisis is first acknowledging that such a crisis exists. While Vladimir Putin has previously addressed the HIV crisis, the limited actions taken by the Russian government and the tendency to punish and delegitimize those who are infected have only contributed to a further degradation of the situation.
Second, Russia must provide access to ART to those living with HIV, regardless of whether an individual is a convict, a conscript, or a citizen. It is possible to slow the spread of the epidemic by treating those who are living with HIV so that their viral loads reach an undetectable level and the virus can no longer be transmitted.
Finally, Russia must undertake a campaign to educate the public and reduce the stigma around HIV infection. Safer-sex education, including for heterosexual partners, and education in the dangers of needle sharing and other intravenous drug use activities should halt the increase in HIV infections in the country, including among the armed forces. Stigmatizing those with the virus but forcing individuals to wear armbands trumpeting their status is degrading and humiliating, and a massive violation of the right to privacy.
In conclusion, while Russia’s HIV crisis has evolved to the point that the spread of infection is out of control, there are important, and known, next steps that can be taken to contain the epidemic and respect the human rights of affected individuals at the same time. This steps are acknowledging that there is a crisis, making treatment available, and destigmatizing a positive diagnosis through education.
